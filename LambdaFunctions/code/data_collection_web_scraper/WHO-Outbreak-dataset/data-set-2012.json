The last case was confirmed on 3 August 2012 and was discharged from the hospital on 24 August 2012. This is double the maximum incubation period (21 days) for Ebola as recommended by WHO. In the outbreak, a total of 24 probable and confirmed cases were recorded, of which 11 were laboratory confirmed by the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) in Entebbe. A total of 17 deaths were reported in this outbreak. \n\nNational and District Ebola Task Forces were coordinated by the MoH to respond to the outbreak. MoH worked closely with WHO and other agencies which included the African Field Epidemiology Network (AFENET), EMESCO Foundation (a local NGO), Infectious Diseases Institute (IDI), Uganda Red Cross Society (URCS), M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), US Centers for Disease Control and prevention (CDC), US Agency for International Development (USAID). WHO also coordinated with the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) to support the response operations. \n\nThe response activities carried out during the outbreak included enhanced surveillance for early case detection and contact tracing, reinforcement of infection prevention and control including case management in isolation facilities using barrier nursing and conducting supervised safe burials, reinforcement of standard precautions in health care settings and enhancing communication interventions at the national and community levels.\n\nA team led by CDC conducted ecological studies in Kibaale district to try and understand the likely source and route of transmission of the virus. Samples from bats, primates and livestock were collected to study the possible source of the Ebola virus and putative initial human infection from wildlife.\n\nThe Ebola response teams have continued to educate the community on prevention, detection of and early reporting of any suspected cases in future. Health workers in the district have been trained on prevention of health care associated infections. \n\nWHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied to the Uganda with respect to this event. \nGeneral information on Ebola subtypes\n\nThere are five identified subtypes of Ebola virus. The subtypes have been named after the location where they were been first detected in EHF outbreaks. Three subtypes of the five have been associated with large EHF outbreaks in Africa. Ebola-Zaire, Ebola-Sudan and Ebola-Bundibugyo. EHF is a febrile haemorrhagic illness which causes death in 25-90% of all cases. The Ebola Reston species, found in the Philippines, can infect humans, but no illness or death in humans has been reported to date.",

WHO is continuing investigations into two recently confirmed infections identified as a novel coronavirus. Today WHO issued an interim case definition to help countries strengthen health protection measures against the new virus. \n\nThe case definition, based on the cases so far, includes criteria for identifying a \u2018patient under investigation\u2019, a \u2018probable case\u2019 and a \u2018confirmed case\u2019. These criteria are based on clinical, epidemiological and laboratory indicators. \n\nFollowing the confirmation of the novel coronavirus, WHO - under the International Health Regulations - immediately alerted all its Member States about the virus and has been leading the coordination and providing guidance to health authorities and technical health agencies. WHO is also identifying a network of laboratories that can provide expertise on coronaviruses for countries. \n\nOn 22 September 2012, the United Kingdom (UK) informed WHO of a case of acute respiratory syndrome with travel history to Saudi Arabia and Qatar.\n\nThe case is a previously healthy, 49 year-old male Qatari national that presented with symptoms on 3 September 2012 with travel history to Saudi Arabia several days prior to onset of illness. On 7 September he was admitted to an intensive care unit in Doha, Qatar. On 11 September, he was transferred to the UK by air ambulance from Qatar. The Health Protection Agency of the UK (HPA) conducted laboratory testing and subsequently confirmed the presence of the novel coronavirus. \n\nThe HPA compared information from the clinical sample collected from the 49 year-old Qatari national with that of a virus sequenced previously by the Erasmus University Medical Centre, Netherlands. This latter isolate was obtained from lung tissue of a fatal case earlier this year in a 60 year-old Saudi national. This comparison indicated 99.5% identity, with one nucleotide mismatch over the regions compared.*\n\nThough it is a very different virus to SARS, given the severity of the two confirmed cases so far, WHO is engaged in further characterizing the novel coronavirus. As such, international efforts are being stepped up across all WHO six regions to ensure an appropriate and effective response with a WHO specialist team in daily contact with more than a dozen international and regional technical partners.\n\nIn addition WHO is working closely with Saudi Arabia, as in previous years, to support the country\u2019s health measures for all visitors participating in the Haji pilgrimage to Mecca next month.\n\n\n* Please note the change as an earlier version stated that sequencing of the virus isolate from the 49 year old had been compared by HPA.",

Subsequent samples have been tested by the field laboratory in Isiro that has been established by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). \n\nThe MoH continues to work with partners to control the outbreak of EHF. A National Task Force convened by the Democratic Republic of Congo Ministry of Health is working with several partners including WHO, United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), US Agency for International Development (USAID) and CDC to control the outbreak.\n\nWHO deployed epidemiologists and logisticians from the Regional Office for Africa (AFRO) including the Inter-country Support Team, and WHO headquarters to support the MoH and is working closely with partners in the areas of coordination, surveillance, epidemiology, public information and social mobilization and logistics for outbreak response. Support from the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), includes deployment of an infection prevention and control (IPC) specialist and an anthropologist to assist with a clearer understanding of the social and anthropological issues among the affected population that could impact the on-going response efforts. \n\nWith respect to this event, WHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied to the DRC. \nGeneral information on Ebola subtypes\n\nThere are five identified subtypes of Ebola virus. The subtypes have been named after the location they have been first detected in Ebola outbreaks. Three subtypes of the five have been associated with large Ebola haemorrhagic fever (EHF) outbreaks in Africa. Ebola-Zaire, Ebola-Sudan and Ebola-Bundibugyo. EHF is a febrile haemorrhagic illness which causes death in 25-90% of all cases. The Ebola Reston species, found in the Philippines, can infect humans, but no illness or death in humans has been reported to date.",

        "Description of the Situation": "12 September 2012 -\nAs of 7 Sept 2012, The National Park Service (NPS) has reported eight cases of Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) among visitors who stayed at Yosemite National Park in California since June 2012. Of these, three were fatal and five cases are recovering. \n\nPark authorities have begun to notify and advise park visitors and those who stayed overnight at \"Signature Tent Cabins\u201d at Yosemite's Curry Village or \"High Sierra Camps\" between 10 June and 24 August 2012 to seek immediate medical attention if they exhibit any symptoms of HPS. \n\nPerson-to-person transmission of Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome has not been reported in the United States. \n\nInvestigations carried out by NPS revealed that seven of the eight reported cases of HPS have been linked to the \"Signature Tent Cabins\" in Curry Village in Yosemite Valley, and one case stayed in multiple \"High Sierra Camps\" in Yosemite (a different area of the park than Curry Village) in July.\n\nThere is no specific treatment or cure for Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome infection. Early recognition and treatment of infected individuals can reduce disease progression. Early symptoms include fatigue, fever, chills, and muscle aches. Fifty percent of the patients can experience headaches, nausea, vomiting, dizziness and abdominal pain. The disease progresses rapidly (4-10 days after initial symptoms) to include coughing, shortness of breath and severe difficulty breathing. \n\nEarly medical attention greatly increases the chance of survival in cases of HPS. It is recommended that if a recent visitor to Yosemite National Park has any of the symptoms listed above, that they seek medical attention immediately and advise their health care professional of the potential exposure to Hantavirus.\n\nNPS continues to work with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the California Department of Public Health, and other state departments of health to detect additional cases and to heighten public health awareness of Hantavirus and HPS. \n\nA non-emergency phone line is still open with NPS for questions and concerns related to Hantavirus in Yosemite +1 209 372-0822. In addition, CDC has a hotline as well (877-232-3322 and 404-639-1510).\n\nAdditional information and updated information about HPS in Yosemite can be found via links on the right to this page.",

The western area of the country where the capital city of Freetown is located, reported more than 60% of all new cases.\n\nThe President of Sierra Leone has declared the cholera epidemic a \"humanitarian crisis\". A high level Presidential Cholera Task Force was established to oversee coordination, mobilization of resources and guide the response. A multi-sectoral approach to the response has been adopted involving the MOHS and other line ministries such as Finance, Information and Communication, and local governments together with partners and stakeholders.\n\nWith support from national and international partners and donors, including UNICEF, Oxfam, British Red Cross, Save the Children, Care, Concern MSF, DFID, OCHA, IRC, and WHO, the MOHS is scaling up the response particularly in the areas of coordination of the overall response, surveillance and case management. \n\nA Cholera Control and Command Center (C4) has been established at the WHO Country Office in Freetown to strengthen coordination, and support the MOHS and other health providers to implement activities related to the Cholera Preparedness and Response Operation Plan (CPROP), in order to bring the epidemic under control as soon as possible. The C4 will also provide information to guide the decision-making of the national task force. \n\nEmphasis is being placed on early detection of cases and timely provision of treatment at the district levels in order to reduce deaths. Cholera cases are managed in cholera treatment units (CTUs) and where there are no established CTUs, emphasis is placed on designating specific areas within the health facilities for isolation purposes.\n\nWHO through the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) has provided experienced case management and laboratory experts from the International Center for Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR,B) to build capacity among health-care workers and laboratory technicians in case management and laboratory diagnosis. \n\nLaboratories at the national level are being supplied with appropriate materials and reagents to collect, transport and analyze laboratory specimens. Laboratory confirmation is important, particularly in new areas experiencing the cholera outbreak. \n\nThere are ongoing community interventions on cholera prevention and control activities. More than 200 traditional healers have been oriented on cholera. Community meetings are organized in Freetown to raise awareness of the importance of avoiding drinking water from unprotected water sources. Text messages are also being used to channel information to the public by telephone companies. UNICEF and other partners are supporting water, sanitation and hygiene activities.\n\n\nWith respect to this event, WHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Sierra Leone.",

Five of these six cases stayed in the same \u201cSignature Tent Cabins\u201d in the Curry Village area of the park. NPS is working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the California Department of Public Health to detect additional cases and to heighten public health awareness of Hantavirus and HPS, in order to rapidly identify potential new cases and provide treatment early. \n\nHPS is a rare but serious disease and is caused by a virus that individuals get through contact with the urine, droppings, or saliva of infected rodents. The deer mouse is the primary host of the virus. The disease begins with fever, chills, muscle aches, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms, but can progress rapidly to life-threatening illness. Symptoms of HPS typically occur from two to four weeks after initial exposure to the virus. However, symptoms can appear as early as one week and as late as six weeks following exposure. Person-to-person transmission of Hantavirus has not been reported in the United States of America. \n\nThere is no specific treatment, cure or vaccine for Hantavirus infection. Early recognition and treatment of infected individuals can reduce disease progression. \n\nThe park authorities are undertaking all measures including intensified building inspections, cleanings throughout the park, monitoring of the rodents population, as well as distribution of Hantavirus information to every visitor and throughout the park. The \u201cSignature Tent Cabins\u201d are now closed.\n\nTravellers are advised to avoid exposure to rodents and their excreta. Adventure travellers, backpackers, campers and travellers with occupational exposure to rodents in countries or areas at risk for Hantaviruses should take precautions to exclude rodents from tents or other accommodation and to protect all food from contamination by rodents.\n\nAn extensive national and international outreach effort is underway by Yosemite National Park and the park concessioner to contact visitors who stayed in the \"Signature Tent Cabins\" at Yosemite's Curry Village since mid-June.

Most of these samples tested positive for enterovirus 71 (EV-71) which causes HFMD. A small proportion of samples also tested positive for other pathogens including Haemophilus Influenzae type B and Streptococcus suis. It was not possible to test all the patients as some of them died before appropriate samples could be taken. \n\nThe investigation included: \n\na thorough review of the hospital records of the patients from Kantha Bhopa hospital as well as from other hospitals; \nlaboratory tests; \nactive follow-up with the affected families by the local Rapid Response Teams (RRT); and \nevaluation of the data from the national surveillance system.\n\n\nA total of 78 cases were identified. These included the initial 62 cases reported by Kantha Bopha hospital, and cases reported from other hospitals. Of these, the investigation focused on 61 cases that fitted a specific criteria (the case definition), and of which 54 had died.\n\nThe investigation revealed that most of the cases were under 3 years of age, from 14 different provinces, with some suffering from chronic conditions. A significant number of cases had been treated with steroids at some point during their illness. Steroid use has been shown to worsen the condition of patients with EV-71. \n\nThe Ministry of Health, with support from WHO and partners, which included Institut Pasteur du Cambodge and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, conducted the investigation following reports from Kantha Bopha Children\u2019s hospital of unusual numbers of illness and deaths among children hospitalised since April 2012. \n\nIn response to this event, health centers have been instructed by the Ministry of Health to report all patients with HFMD. In addition, the Ministry of Health, assisted by WHO, has begun enhanced surveillance for neuro-respiratory syndrome, a key syndrome observed among patients with severe HFMD caused by EV-71. It is expected that the enhanced surveillance will identify occasional new cases of the severe form of the disease in the coming months.\n\nIn addition, the Ministry of Health is developing guidelines and training courses for staff to manage patients with mild and severe forms of HFMD. A campaign to raise awareness on the prevention, identification and care of children with HFMD is underway.",

        "Description of the Situation": "14 September 2012 -\nRetrospective epidemiological investigation recently identified additional confirmed and probable cases with Ebola haemorrhagic fever (EHF) in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), according to the Ministry of Health (MoH).\n\nAs of 12 September 2012, 41 cases (9 laboratory confirmed, and 32 probable) have been reported from Haut-U\u00e9l\u00e9 district in Province Orientale. Of these cases, 18 have been fatal. (5 confirmed and 13 probable). 18 healthcare workers are included among the probable cases. 28 suspected cases have also been reported and are being investigated. \n\nSince the last update, an additional 27 cases (1 laboratory confirmed and 26 probable) of EHF were identified through retrospective epidemiological investigation in the two health zones of Isiro and Viadana. The retrospective epidemiological investigation was done to identify cases of illness which might have been EHF between the end of April 2012 and August 2012, and thus help clarify the possible origins of the outbreak and provide additional information on chains of transmission. In addition, active field epidemiological investigation is continuing to help identify all possible chains of continuing transmission of the illness, to ensure that appropriate measures are immediately taken to interrupt the transmission, and stop the outbreak. \n\nInitial samples were tested by the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) in Entebbe, Uganda, and were confirmed for Ebola virus (Ebola subtype Bundibugyo). Subsequent samples have been tested by the field laboratory in Isiro that has been established by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). \n\nThe MoH continues to work with partners to control the outbreak of EHF. A National Task Force convened by the Democratic Republic of Congo Ministry of Health is working with several partners including WHO, United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), US Agency for International Development (USAID) and CDC to control the outbreak.\n\nWHO deployed epidemiologists and logisticians from the Regional Office for Africa (AFRO) including the Inter-country Support Team, and WHO headquarters to support the MoH and is working closely with partners in the areas of coordination, surveillance, epidemiology, public information and social mobilization and logistics for outbreak response. Support from the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), includes deployment of an infection prevention and control (IPC) specialist and an anthropologist to assist with a clearer understanding of the social and anthropological issues among the affected population that could impact the on-going response efforts. \n\nWith respect to this event, WHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied to the DRC. \nGeneral information on Ebola subtypes\n\nThere are five identified subtypes of Ebola virus. The subtypes have been named after the location they have been first detected in Ebola outbreaks. Three subtypes of the five have been associated with large Ebola haemorrhagic fever (EHF) outbreaks in Africa. Ebola-Zaire, Ebola-Sudan and Ebola-Bundibugyo. EHF is a febrile haemorrhagic illness which causes death in 25-90% of all cases. The Ebola Reston species, found in the Philippines, can infect humans, but no illness or death in humans has been reported to date.",

        "Description of the Situation": "12 September 2012 -\nAs of 7 Sept 2012, The National Park Service (NPS) has reported eight cases of Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) among visitors who stayed at Yosemite National Park in California since June 2012. Of these, three were fatal and five cases are recovering. \n\nPark authorities have begun to notify and advise park visitors and those who stayed overnight at \"Signature Tent Cabins\u201d at Yosemite's Curry Village or \"High Sierra Camps\" between 10 June and 24 August 2012 to seek immediate medical attention if they exhibit any symptoms of HPS. \n\nPerson-to-person transmission of Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome has not been reported in the United States. \n\nInvestigations carried out by NPS revealed that seven of the eight reported cases of HPS have been linked to the \"Signature Tent Cabins\" in Curry Village in Yosemite Valley, and one case stayed in multiple \"High Sierra Camps\" in Yosemite (a different area of the park than Curry Village) in July.\n\nThere is no specific treatment or cure for Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome infection. Early recognition and treatment of infected individuals can reduce disease progression. Early symptoms include fatigue, fever, chills, and muscle aches. Fifty percent of the patients can experience headaches, nausea, vomiting, dizziness and abdominal pain. The disease progresses rapidly (4-10 days after initial symptoms) to include coughing, shortness of breath and severe difficulty breathing. \n\nEarly medical attention greatly increases the chance of survival in cases of HPS. It is recommended that if a recent visitor to Yosemite National Park has any of the symptoms listed above, that they seek medical attention immediately and advise their health care professional of the potential exposure to Hantavirus.\n\nNPS continues to work with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the California Department of Public Health, and other state departments of health to detect additional cases and to heighten public health awareness of Hantavirus and HPS. \n\nA non-emergency phone line is still open with NPS for questions and concerns related to Hantavirus in Yosemite +1 209 372-0822. In addition, CDC has a hotline as well (877-232-3322 and 404-639-1510).\n\nAdditional information and updated information about HPS in Yosemite can be found via links on the right to this page.",

The western area of the country where the capital city of Freetown is located, reported more than 60% of all new cases.\n\nThe President of Sierra Leone has declared the cholera epidemic a \"humanitarian crisis\". A high level Presidential Cholera Task Force was established to oversee coordination, mobilization of resources and guide the response. A multi-sectoral approach to the response has been adopted involving the MOHS and other line ministries such as Finance, Information and Communication, and local governments together with partners and stakeholders.\n\nWith support from national and international partners and donors, including UNICEF, Oxfam, British Red Cross, Save the Children, Care, Concern MSF, DFID, OCHA, IRC, and WHO, the MOHS is scaling up the response particularly in the areas of coordination of the overall response, surveillance and case management. \n\nA Cholera Control and Command Center (C4) has been established at the WHO Country Office in Freetown to strengthen coordination, and support the MOHS and other health providers to implement activities related to the Cholera Preparedness and Response Operation Plan (CPROP), in order to bring the epidemic under control as soon as possible. The C4 will also provide information to guide the decision-making of the national task force. \n\nEmphasis is being placed on early detection of cases and timely provision of treatment at the district levels in order to reduce deaths. Cholera cases are managed in cholera treatment units (CTUs) and where there are no established CTUs, emphasis is placed on designating specific areas within the health facilities for isolation purposes.\n\nWHO through the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) has provided experienced case management and laboratory experts from the International Center for Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR,B) to build capacity among health-care workers and laboratory technicians in case management and laboratory diagnosis. \n\nLaboratories at the national level are being supplied with appropriate materials and reagents to collect, transport and analyze laboratory specimens. Laboratory confirmation is important, particularly in new areas experiencing the cholera outbreak. \n\nThere are ongoing community interventions on cholera prevention and control activities. More than 200 traditional healers have been oriented on cholera. Community meetings are organized in Freetown to raise awareness of the importance of avoiding drinking water from unprotected water sources. Text messages are also being used to channel information to the public by telephone companies. UNICEF and other partners are supporting water, sanitation and hygiene activities.\n\n\nWith respect to this event, WHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Sierra Leone.",

Five of these six cases stayed in the same \u201cSignature Tent Cabins\u201d in the Curry Village area of the park. NPS is working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the California Department of Public Health to detect additional cases and to heighten public health awareness of Hantavirus and HPS, in order to rapidly identify potential new cases and provide treatment early. \n\nHPS is a rare but serious disease and is caused by a virus that individuals get through contact with the urine, droppings, or saliva of infected rodents. The deer mouse is the primary host of the virus. The disease begins with fever, chills, muscle aches, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms, but can progress rapidly to life-threatening illness. Symptoms of HPS typically occur from two to four weeks after initial exposure to the virus. However, symptoms can appear as early as one week and as late as six weeks following exposure. Person-to-person transmission of Hantavirus has not been reported in the United States of America. \n\nThere is no specific treatment, cure or vaccine for Hantavirus infection. Early recognition and treatment of infected individuals can reduce disease progression. \n\nThe park authorities are undertaking all measures including intensified building inspections, cleanings throughout the park, monitoring of the rodents population, as well as distribution of Hantavirus information to every visitor and throughout the park. The \u201cSignature Tent Cabins\u201d are now closed.\n\nTravellers are advised to avoid exposure to rodents and their excreta. Adventure travellers, backpackers, campers and travellers with occupational exposure to rodents in countries or areas at risk for Hantaviruses should take precautions to exclude rodents from tents or other accommodation and to protect all food from contamination by rodents.\n\nAn extensive national and international outreach effort is underway by Yosemite National Park and the park concessioner to contact visitors who stayed in the \"Signature Tent Cabins\" at Yosemite's Curry Village since mid-June.

These partners include WHO, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC), the Uganda Red Cross Society (URCS) and M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF). WHO has deployed logisticians and supplies, including personal protective equipment (PPE) to Uganda. \n\nRequired funds for local operations are being mobilized. Additional support is being received from the EMESCO Foundation (a local NGO), Members of Parliament from Kibaale district, the Infectious Diseases Institute (IDI) and the Uganda Red Cross Society (URCS).\n\nEpidemiologists from WHO and US CDC have arrived in Kibaale district and are supporting the response by screening and triaging suspected cases of Ebola haemorrhagic fever. WHO is coordinating with Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network partners. \n\nWith the support of MSF, the construction of a new isolation facility in Kagadi, Kibaale district, is expected to be completed today and additional wards will open to address the increasing number of suspected cases. MSF, IDI and EMESCO are providing food to patients in the isolation facility and have committed to continue to do so for the next two weeks. \n\nFor active surveillance and contact tracing in the communities, arrangements with local authorities are being made to increase the number of mobile teams and ambulances.\n\nWith regard to social mobilization, the Uganda Red Cross Society has trained 62 teams of Red Cross volunteers and village health teams to conduct social mobilization and public awareness activities. Additionally, public announcements are being disseminated in 11 local languages on 20 radio stations. WHO is facilitating the deployment of a medical anthropologist to assist in these activities. \nNeighbouring countries\n\nA number of countries neighbouring Uganda have taken proactive steps to enhance their surveillance to detect and respond to cases of Ebola haemorrhagic fever.\n\nIn Kenya, two rumoured suspected cases have since been reported and investigated. Both cases have tested negative for Ebola.\n\nThe South Sudan Ministry of Health, in collaboration with WHO, has issued guidance to the general public and has activated a national task force to undertake enhanced surveillance as population movement and trade between South Sudan and Uganda are high. \n\nWHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions are applied to Uganda.",

Onset of symptoms occurred on 11 October 2011 and progressively got worse until he died in Sandema Hospital on 18 October 2011. District outbreak teams investigated the affected areas but found no additional cases. \n\nA reactive campaign has been planned starting 6 February 2012, supported by the International Coordinating Group on Yellow Fever Vaccine Provision (YF-ICG) and the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO). Over 235 000 people in the affected districts have been targeted for vaccination, with the exclusion of pregnant women and children aged under one year. \n\nThis activity will complement the two-phased YF preventive mass campaign undertaken by the country. The first phase was conducted in November 2011 and targeted a population of 5.8 million people covering 40 districts (8 regions). A YF reactive campaign was carried out in 3 more districts. The second phase, planned for this year, seeks to target 1.7 million people spanning 17 districts.",

        "Description of the Situation": "17 January 2012 -\nIn March 2010, Poly Implant Proth\u00e8se (PIP) silicone implants were withdrawn from the European Union (EU) market following an observed increase in implant ruptures, and confirmation of the use of substandard silicone in the manufacture of the implants by French regulator AFSSAPS (Agence Fran\u00e7aise de S\u00e9curit\u00e9 Sanitaire des Produits de Sant\u00e9). Regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions were also notified, leading to product withdrawal from a number of non-EU countries. PIP implants have also been sold under the trade name of M-Implants and in April 2010 the Dutch Health Care Inspectorate prohibited all trade and usage of both products in the Netherlands.\n\nOn 23 December 2011, the French authorities published a recommendation that French residents with PIP breast implants should consider having these removed as a preventive measure. Following this, other national health authorities have issued their own recommendations that have ranged from preventive removal of PIP silicone breast implants, to close monitoring and follow up of persons with these implants.\n\nAdverse events of approved breast implants include implant rupture and leakage. While the rupture rate of PIP prostheses was observed to be higher than expected in France, rates reported by other national authorities vary.\n\nTesting of PIP implants carried out by AFSSAPS found that the quality of implants varied, therefore increasing the risk of rupture. AFSSAPS also found that the gel containing non-approved silicone was an irritant to tissue, and when leaking could give rise to inflammation and pain.\n\nMore information is needed about the risks associated with these implants and how they compare with other implants on the market, and on product distribution, use and surveillance.\n\nPIP and M-Implants silicone breast prostheses have been distributed to many countries around the world. Both standard and substandard silicone has been used to produce PIP implants.\n\nPersons with PIP or M-Implant prostheses should consult their doctor or surgeon if they suspect rupture, have pain or inflammation or any other concerns. Affected persons and physicians should take note of their national health authority recommendations and act accordingly. It is, furthermore, important to consider strengthening adverse event reporting of medical devices.\n\nSpecific recommendations by national regulatory authorities can be found at the following websites (listed by country):\n\n\nArgentina \n\nAustralia \n\nAustria \n\nBelgium \n\nBrazil \n\nChile \n\nChina \n\nColombia \n\nCosta Rica \n\nCuba \n\nCzech Republic \n\nDenmark \n\nEcuador  \n\nEstonia \n\nFrance - Ministry of Health \n\nFrance - Regulator of health products \n\nFrance - Regulator of health products: new recommendations for women with PIP implants \n\nGermany \n\nHungary \n\nItaly \n\nIreland \n\nJapan \n\nMalaysia \n\nMexico \n\nNetherlands \n\nNew Zealand \n\nPeru \n\nPortugal \n\nSpain - Ministry of Health, Social Services and Equality \n\nSpain - Ministry of Health, Social Services and Equality: Information on Poly Implant Prosthesis (PIP) silicone implants \n\nUnited Kingdom",
