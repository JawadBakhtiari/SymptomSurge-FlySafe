        "Outbreak name": "Western equine encephalitis",
        "Date Reported": "28 December 2023",
        "Location": "Argentina",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 20 December, the International Health Regulations National Focal Point (IHR NFP) of Argentina notified the World Health Organization (WHO) of a human case of Western Equine Encephalitis (WEE) infection. This is the first confirmed human case reported after more than two decades, since the last reported human cases in Argentina occurred in 1982/1983 and 1996.\nWEE is a rare mosquito-borne viral disease that affects equines and humans. Most human cases are associated with epidemics in birds or horses. The virus has the potential to spread to other areas through the migration of infected birds or the movement of people and animals carrying the virus. Given that birds act as a reservoir, they can act as amplifying hosts for viral dissemination to other countries. At-risk groups include people who live, work, or participate in outdoor activities in endemic areas or where there are declared active disease outbreaks in animals.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 20 December,\u00a0the IHR NFP of Argentina notified the WHO of a human case of WEE infection. The patient is an adult from the province of Santa Fe. \u00a0This is the first human case of WEE reported after more than two decades, since the last cases reported in humans in Argentina occurred in 1982/1983 (associated with an outbreak in equines) and 1996 (an isolated case based on clinical and serological findings but with no equine cases detected).1The patient developed symptoms including headache, myalgia, dizziness, disorientation, and sudden-onset fever on 19 November 2023. On 24 November 2023, the patient received medical attention and was hospitalized in a health facility in the province, where he required intensive care and mechanical ventilation for 12 days. The patient was discharged on 20 December and is undergoing outpatient monitoring.1\u00a0Regarding the exposure history, according to information from the epidemiological investigation, the patient is a rural worker in an area where equines that tested positive for WEE infection had previously been identified.1Patient samples were collected on 24 November 2023, at a hospital in the province, and, on 4 December 2023, were sent to the Reference Laboratory of the National Institute of Human Viral Diseases \"Dr. Julio I. Maiztegui\" (INEVH per its acronym in Spanish), which is part of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (ANLIS Malbr\u00e1n). The samples tested positive on 19 December 2023 for the detection of specific neutralizing antibodies for the WEE virus. The samples also tested negative for other alphaviruses: Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) virus, Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis (VEE) virus, Una virus, Mayaro virus, and Chikungunya virus.",
        "Epidemiology": "WEE is a rare mosquito-borne disease caused by a virus of the same name, which belongs to the genus\u00a0Alphavirus\u00a0of the\u00a0Togaviridae\u00a0family, to which the EEE and VEE viruses also belong. The main reservoir hosts of EEE and WEE viruses are passerine birds.2\u00a0In humans, the WEE virus can cause disease ranging from subclinical or moderate symptoms to severe forms of aseptic meningitis and encephalitis. The virus has the potential to spread to other areas through the migration of infected birds or even through the movement of people and animals carrying the virus. Given that birds act as a reservoir, they can act as amplifying hosts for viral dissemination to other countries. At-risk groups include people who live, work, or participate in outdoor activities in endemic areas or where there are declared active disease outbreaks in animals. In Argentina, between 25 November and 27 December of 2023, a total of 1182 outbreaks of WEE disease have been identified in equines in 12 provinces of the country: Buenos Aires (n = 717), Santa Fe (n = 149), C\u00f3rdoba (n = 141), Entre R\u00edos (n = 69), Corrientes (n = 41), Chaco (n = 19), La Pampa (n = 18), R\u00edo Negro (n = 11), Formosa (n = 8), Santiago del Estero (n = 6), San Luis (n = 2), and Salta (n = 1).3",
        "Public Health Response": "Following the detection of the WEE virus in equines, the Ministry of Health activated a nationwide epidemiological alert, on 28 November 2023, to provide further information on the disease outbreaks in equines and to strengthen epidemiological surveillance of possible human cases.\u00a0 The epidemiological surveillance includes both passive and active case finding, the latter in areas with active disease outbreaks in animals, according to the case definitions established in the Circular for the epidemiological and laboratory surveillance, prevention and control of Western Equine Encephalitis in Argentina.4Argentina's national Ministry of Health is also working together with the National Food Safety and Quality Service (SENASA per its acronym in Spanish) and the Ministries of Health of the Province of Santa Fe and of other affected provinces, on the implementation of preventive measures, epidemiological surveillance and outbreak control actions.1",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "The primary mode of WEE virus transmission is through the bites of infected mosquitoes, which act as vectors. The principal vector is Culex tarsalis; however, there are multiple vectors that contribute to transmission, including\u00a0Aedes\u00a0melanimon,\u00a0Aedes\u00a0dorsalis,\u00a0and\u00a0Aedes campestris.\u00a0These vectors maintain the circulation of the virus in wild enzootic cycles where birds act as reservoirs of the virus. Humans and equines act as the final reservoirs of the virus, incapable of transmitting the virus to mosquitoes.5 People engaged in outside work or activities are at greater risk because of exposure to mosquitoes. Outbreaks of WEE in humans generally present as isolated cases with moderate symptoms and most infections are asymptomatic. Neurological manifestations include meningitis, encephalitis, or myelitis. Similar to other arboviral encephalitis, the encephalitis caused by WEE is characterized by fever accompanied by altered mental status, seizures, or focal neurological signs including movement disorders.6 There is no specific antiviral treatment and patient management primarily involves supportive care measures.",
        "WHO Advice": "Below is a summary of the main recommendations for laboratory diagnosis in humans, surveillance, and prevention measures.Laboratory diagnosis of WEE in humansThe diagnosis of WEE infection requires confirmation through laboratory techniques since the clinical presentation is not specific. These laboratory methods include virological (direct) diagnostic methods by nucleic acid amplification or potentially cell culture and serological (indirect) methods, aiming to detect antibodies produced against the virus. Generally, samples for diagnosis include serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF should only be collected in cases with neurological symptoms and by clinical indication.\u00a0The diagnostic methods are described in more detail in the\u00a0Laboratory Guidelines for the Detection and Diagnosis of Western Equine Encephalitis Virus Human Infection.7SurveillanceIn at-risk areas with reported active outbreaks in animals, strengthening surveillance is recommended with active human case finding for compatible neurological syndromes without any other defined diagnosis, taking into account the incubation period, geographic area, and environmental conditions.Prevention MeasuresPreventive actions, listed below, must be organized within the framework of One Health, considering the inter-institutional and comprehensive action between animal health, human health, and the environment.Managing the environmentConsidering the ecology and biology of the main vectors of the WEE virus, the main prevention measures recommended are modifying the environment and environmental management to reduce the number of mosquitoes and their contact with equines and humans. These measures include:Filling or draining water collections, ponds, or temporary flooding sites that may serve as sites of female oviposition and breeding sites for mosquito larvae.Elimination of weeds around premises to reduce mosquito resting and shelter sites.Protecting equines by sheltering them in stables with mosquito nets, particularly at times when mosquitoes are most active.Although the main vectors do not have indoor habits, it is advisable to protect homes with mosquito nets on doors and windows; in this way, other arboviruses are also prevented.Vector ControlVector control measures for the WEE virus should be considered within the Integrated Vector Management (IVM) framework. It is important to consider that the decision to carry out vector control activities with insecticides depends on entomological surveillance data and the variables that may increase in the risk of transmission, including insecticide resistance data. Insecticide spraying may be considered as an additional measure, where technically feasible, in areas of transmission where high mosquito populations are detected. The methodology should be established based on the ecology and behavior of local vectors.Vaccination in equinesVaccines are available for equines. It is advisable to seek high vaccination coverage among susceptible equines in areas considered at risk and to carry out annual vaccination boosters.Personal Protective MeasuresUse of clothing that covers the legs and arms, especially in households where someone is ill.Use of repellents containing DEET, IR3535 or Icaridin, which may be applied to exposed skin or clothing, in strict accordance with the instructions on the product label.Use wire mesh/mosquito nets on doors and windows.Use of insecticide-treated or non-insecticide nets for daytime sleepers (e.g. pregnant women, infants, bedridden people, the elderly, and night shift workers).In outbreak situations, outdoor activities should be avoided during the period of greatest mosquito activity (dawn and dusk).",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "Global Overview\u00a0Current situation\u00a0The global incidence of dengue has markedly increased over the past two decades, posing a substantial public health challenge. From 2000 to 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) documented a ten-fold surge in reported cases worldwide increasing from 500 000 to 5.2 million. The year 2019 marked an unprecedented peak, with reported instances spreading across 129 countries.\u00a0\u00a0After a slight decline of cases between the year 2020-2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and lower reporting rate, in 2023, an upsurge in dengue cases have been observed globally, characterized by a significant increase in the number, scale, and simultaneous occurrence of multiple outbreaks, spreading into regions previously unaffected by dengue.\u00a0Dengue transmission is cyclic and large outbreaks every 3-4 years can be expected. During the COVID-19 pandemic we saw moderate transmission of dengue in some regions and low transmission in others leading to an accumulation of people without immunity to certain dengue virus serotypes. However, the data on the circulating dengue serotypes is limited.\u00a0\u00a0Since the beginning of 2023, ongoing transmission, combined with an unexpected spike in dengue cases have resulted in close to a historic high of over five million cases and more than 5000 dengue-related deaths reported in over 80 countries/territories and five WHO regions: Africa, Americas, South-East Asia, Western Pacific and Eastern Mediterranean Regions globally (Figure 1). Close to 80% of these cases, or 4.1 million, have been reported in the Region of the Americas. Dengue is the most widespread arbovirus and causes the highest number of arboviral disease cases in the Region of the Americas, with cyclic epidemics recurring every 3 to 5 years. In addition, clusters of autochthonous dengue have been reported in the WHO European Region. However, these numbers are likely an underestimate of the true burden as most of the primary infections are asymptomatic and dengue reporting is not mandatory in many countries.\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u00a0Several factors are associated with the increasing risk of spread of the dengue epidemic including, the changing distribution of the vectors (chiefly Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus), especially in previously dengue na\u00efve countries; the consequences of El Nino phenomena in 2023 and climate change leading to increasing temperatures and high rainfall, humidity among others; fragile health systems in the midst of COVID-19 pandemic, political and financial instabilities in countries facing complex humanitarian crises and high population movements. These factors also challenge the response to the epidemic and the risk of further spread to other countries. Weakness in the surveillance systems in many affected countries may have led to delayed reporting and response and missed identification of symptoms, contributing to increased severe dengue outcomes.\u00a0WHO has assessed the risk to be high globally considering the increasing risk of transmission and the upsurge of cases and deaths.\u00a0\u00a0Figure 1: Countries/territories/areas reporting autochthonous dengue cases (November 2022- November 2023)\u00a0** Based on most recent available data (the data should be interpreted considering the differences in reporting rates and case definitions between the regions).Regional overview\u00a0WHO Region of Africa:\u00a0Africa is among the top four regions most affected by arboviral diseases, including yellow fever, dengue, chikungunya, O'nyong nyong, Rift Valley fever, and Zika. In 2023, 171 991 dengue cases have been reported in countries in the region and 753 deaths.\u202fEvidence of dengue circulation has been detected in local populations and/or among travelers returning from more than 30 African countries.\u00a0\u00a0Outbreaks have been reported from 15 of the 47 countries including Benin, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Chad, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Mali, Mauritius, Niger, Nigeria, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Principe, Senegal and Togo. The outbreaks in most of these countries began in 2023, except in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, where it was a continuation of an outbreak that started in April 2022. As of 19 December 2023, outbreaks are still ongoing in 11 countries and were declared over in Chad, Guinea, Mauritius, and S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe.\u00a0The most affected country in the region in 2023 is Burkina Faso, experiencing a significant increase in dengue cases compared with the same periods in 2021 and 2022. As of 18 December, the cumulative number of cases reported in the country for 2023 is 146 878 suspected cases, including 68 346 probable cases (positive rapid diagnostic test) and 688 deaths among suspected cases, representing a case fatality rate of 0.5%.\u202f\u202f\u00a0The burden of dengue in Africa is not well understood due to i) similarity of common, non-specific clinical symptoms of the disease with malaria and other tropical febrile illnesses; ii) limited laboratory capacity for timely detection and confirmation of dengue, which is crucial for detecting and reporting cases and preventing its spread; and iii) inadequate surveillance and limited case reporting, especially for dengue.\u00a0Efforts are ongoing to better understand the transmission dynamics of dengue and other arboviruses in the region.\u202f\u202fThe WHO Regional Office for Africa has endorsed the Framework for the integrated control, elimination and eradication of tropical and vector-borne diseases in the African Region 2022-2030. Equally, the Regional Office has also drafted the Framework for implementation of the Global Arbovirus Initiative by targeted Member States in the WHO African Region.\u00a0WHO Region of the Americas:Between 1 January 2023 and 11 December 2023, a total of 4.1 million suspected dengue cases (cumulative incidence of 419 cases per 100 000 population), including 6710 severe cases (0.16% of suspected cases) and 2049 deaths (CFR 0.05%) were reported from 42 countries and territories in the Region of the Americas, with 15 countries reporting active outbreak. Of the total number of dengue cases until 12 November 2023 (EW 48 of 2023), 1 895 122 (45%) were laboratory confirmed.\u00a0Currently, 46 countries and territories systematically report, through the Health Information Platform for the Americas (PLISA), on a weekly basis, the total number of cases, incidence, number of severe cases, number of deaths and lethality due to dengue, as well as entomological surveillance data. As of EW 48, Brazil has reported the highest number of suspected cases in the Region (n = 2 909 404; 1359 cases per 100 000 population), followed by Peru (n= 271 279; 813 cases per 100 000 population), and Mexico (n = 235 616; 179 cases per 100 000 population). In terms of severe dengue, Colombia reported the most cases (1504; 1.35% of cases), followed by Brazil (1474; 0.05% of cases), Mexico (1272; 0.54% of cases), Peru (1065; 0.39% of cases), and Bolivia (640; 0.44% of cases).\u202f\u202f\u00a0Although dengue is endemic in most countries of South America, Mexico and Central America, and the Caribbean countries, the second half of 2023 has witnessed an alarming increase in cases, with cumulative cases for the year surpassing all previous yearly totals and in some countries extending beyond historically affected areas of transmission. Dengue cases have increased in the Americas over the past four decades, from 1.5 million cases from 1980 to 1989 to 17.5 million in 2010-2019. Before 2023, the highest historical dengue caseload was in 2019, with over 3.18 million cases, 28 208 severe cases, and 1823 deaths (CFR 0.06).\u00a0\u00a0DENV is the most widespread arbovirus and causes the highest number of arboviral disease cases in the Region of the Americas, with cyclic epidemics recurring every 3 to 5 years. Approximately 500 million people in the region are at risk of dengue infection today. Ae. aegypti, the vector mosquito for dengue, is widely distributed in the Americas, only Canada is free from dengue and its vector. In Uruguay, where Ae. Aegypti is present, limited autochthonous transmission was last reported in 2016, and only imported cases have been reported since then.\u00a0All four DENV serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4) are currently circulating in the Americas. DENV-3 and DENV-4 are being detected more frequently in 2023 after several years of predominant detection of DENV-1 and DENV-2. Nevertheless, nine countries are reporting the co-circulation of all four dengue serotypes. Simultaneous circulation of all these serotypes has been detected in Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, and Venezuela. The Arbovirus Diagnosis Laboratory Network of the Americas (RELDA as per its acronym in Spanish) has been strengthened to face the introduction of new dengue serotypes and the re-emergence of other arboviral diseases, such as chikungunya, Zika, and West Nile virus, all of which are currently circulating in the region alongside dengue. The main objective of the network is to ensure efficient laboratory surveillance and robust installed capacity to respond to outbreaks and epidemics.\u00a0WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region:\u00a0Dengue and severe dengue epidemics were first reported in the Region in 1998, and since then, their frequency and geographical spread have increased, with outbreaks occurring in all nine endemic countries: Afghanistan, Djibouti, Egypt, Oman, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen.\u00a0\u00a0Among these are fragile, conflict affected and vulnerable countries such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, Sudan, Somalia and Yemen. The outbreaks are exacerbated due to disruption of health services (Sudan), fragile health systems (Afghanistan, Somalia, Sudan, Pakistan and Yemen), mass population movements, poor water and sanitation infrastructure, and recurring natural disasters such as floods affecting Somalia, Sudan, Pakistan, and Yemen, along with earthquakes in Afghanistan. Outbreaks are also reported in middle- and high-income countries such as Egypt, Oman and Saudi Arabia due to climate change leading to unusual rainfalls. Pakistan (n= 20 072), Saudi Arabia and Oman have reported the highest number of confirmed cases thus far in 2023.\u202f\u202f\u00a0During these epidemics, all four serotypes of dengue virus were known to circulate in the Region. Ae. aegypti is the predominant and primary vector transmitting dengue in the EMR endemic countries. More recently, Bahrain, Iran, and Qatar have reported the presence of Ae. aegypti, although no local transmission of dengue has been documented. Additionally, presence of the secondary vector of dengue, Ae. albopictus, has also been reported from ten EMR countries (Afghanistan, Iran, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Oman, Pakistan, Palestine, Syria and Tunisia).\u202f\u202f\u00a0The effectiveness of response measures is hindered by several factors including i) constrained laboratory capacities ii) challenges in accessing healthcare iii) shortages of human resources iv) limited and inconsistent vector surveillance v) insecticide resistance, vi) poor community engagement and health education vii) a fragmented surveillance system. vii) The ongoing armed hostilities in many Eastern Mediterranean Region countries further compound the complexities of response efforts.\u00a0WHO European Region:\u202f\u00a0Dengue is not endemic in the WHO European Region and cases are mainly travel-related; however, since 2010, there have been reports of autochthonous cases in a number of countries in the region, including Croatia, France, Israel, Italy, Portugal and Spain. In 2018, the year with the most comprehensive data available, a total of 2500 cases of dengue were reported to WHO through the regional annual surveillance data collection mechanism with Germany, France, and the United Kingdom contributing the majority of cases. The vast majority of these cases were imported. However, it should be noted that data completeness remains challenging.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Between 1 January and 5 December 2023, sporadic autochthonous cases and outbreaks have been reported in three countries: Italy (n = 82), France (n = 43) and Spain (n = 3). Routine testing for dengue in Member States of the WHO European Region is not common unless there is a travel history and clinical suspicion, hence the actual numbers of dengue cases in 2023 is likely to be underestimated.\u202fOne death of an imported, travel-related case was reported in Italy; no additional deaths have been reported in European countries in 2023 to date.\u00a0\u00a0The Ae. albopictus mosquito, which is the main vector of dengue virus in Europe, is established in several Southern European countries. Ae. albopictus mosquitoes have been detected further north and west in the past ten years and it has capacity to hibernate in winter. In 2023, this mosquito species has been identified in 13 countries of the region, a notable increase from eight countries in 2013.\u00a0While cold winters prevent year-round transmission of mosquito-borne diseases, the climatic suitability for transmission of DENV in Europe is increasing, leading to floods and stagnant water pools. These create more favorable conditions for the competent vector population.\u202f Ae. aegypti (principal dengue vector in most countries) does not survive over winter well but has been established in Cyprus and Madeira, Portugal since 2022.\u00a0These trends can potentially lead to an increase in the number of dengue cases and possible fatalities.\u00a0Robust public health systems in many countries, including access to early diagnosis, case referral, and management of severe cases, contribute to reduced severe health impact and further disease spread for both imported and autochthonous cases.\u202f\u202f\u202f\u00a0WHO South-East Asia Region:\u202f\u00a0In the WHO Southeast Asia region, 10 out of 11 Member States are known to be endemic for dengue virus. In 2023, several countries, including Bangladesh and Thailand, have reported a notable surge in dengue cases compared to previous years. In particular, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Thailand rank among the world's 30 most highly endemic countries.\u202f\u00a0Compared to 2022, in 2023, Bangladesh and Thailand recorded a larger number of dengue cases . By November 2023, Bangladesh experienced a substantial rise in cases reaching 308 167 compared to 62 382 reported for the entirety of 2022. Thailand saw an increase of over 300%, with dengue cases rising from 46 678 in 2022 to 136 655 in 2023 (as of 22 November 2023). During the same period, the death toll in Bangladesh rose from 281 (CFR 0.45%) to 1598 (CFR 0.52%), while in Thailand, it increased from 34 (CFR 0.07%) to 147 (CFR 0.11%). In other countries, the CFR ranged from 0.04% in Nepal to 0.72% in Indonesia. It's important to interpret these values cautiously due to variations in the case definition used across countries, with some systems primarily focused on reporting hospitalized or severe dengue cases.\u00a0In addition, spatial and temporal shifts in dengue patterns were observed in 2022 and continued in 2023. Nepal and Bangladesh experienced spikes in case numbers earlier than usual. Cases in Nepal shifted from the Kathmandu Valley in 2022 to the southeast Terai region and hill districts in Gandaki province in 2023. India, in 2023, experienced an increase in cases in Kerala and northeastern States bordering Bangladesh compared to the previous year.\u00a0WHO Western Pacific Region:\u00a0The Western Pacific Region continues to face a high burden of mosquito-borne arboviral diseases, particularly dengue. These diseases cause significant morbidity and mortality, especially among those unreached by quality primary health care (PHC) services.\u00a0\u00a0Between 1 January 2023 to 7 December 2023, over 500 000 dengue cases and 750 deaths were reported from eight countries/territories/areas in the WHO Western Pacific Region: Australia, Cambodia, China, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Viet Nam. The most affected countries are the Philippines, reporting 167 355 cases and 575 deaths (CFR 0.34%), and Viet Nam with 149 557 cases and 36 deaths (CFR: 0.02%). Dengue is endemic in several countries such as Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, the Philippines, and Viet Nam.\u202f\u202f\u00a0In Pacific Island countries/territories (n = 21), in 2023, dengue-like illness1 was reported from nine Pacific countries/territories, resulting in a total of 13 339 cases, a 28% increase reported as of 30 November compared to 2022. Among the most affected are Fiji, which reported 8418 cases in 2022 and 11 522 cases and 2023, reflecting a 37% increase.\u202f\u202f\u00a0Member States with endemic transmission continue to report longer seasonal dengue epidemics with increasing magnitude and geographic spread. However, disease incidence is less reliable due to the underreporting of cases, particularly in the Pacific Island Countries and territories based on their current syndromic surveillance of dengue as dengue-like illness (DLI) reporting system. Furthermore, the reported number of deaths due to severe dengue is variable. As such, country-level and sub-national case fatality rates (CFR) may appear inconsistent.\u202f\u202f\u00a0Due to the endemicity of dengue and public health burden in the Western Pacific Region, in 2008, the Regional Committee for WPR endorsed the Dengue Strategic Plan for the Asia Pacific Region 2008-2015 (resolution WPR/RC59.R6), serving as a road map. Subsequently, in 2016, considering the growing regional trends in dengue morbidity and mortality, the Western Pacific Regional Action Plan for Dengue Prevention and Control was developed. This plan recommended a switch in strategy from outbreak containment to reducing the impact of dengue on communities.\u202f\u202fThere is a window of opportunity for Pacific countries/territories to improve the adherence to the existing WHO \u201cFramework for National Surveillance and control plans for Aedes vectors\u201d in the Pacific for non-endemic countries in the Pacific Region. Given the impact of climate change on the spread and endemicities of Arboviral diseases, establishing a comprehensive Early Warning System (EWS) that integrates climate, disease, viral/ serological, and entomology surveillance is crucial. Such a system has the potential to predict future risks in vulnerable communities.",
        "Epidemiology": "Dengue virus (DENV) is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes typically in tropical and sub-tropical climates worldwide, mostly in urban and semi-urban areas. The primary vectors that transmit the disease are Aedes aegypti and, to a lesser extent, Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, though in some regions such as Europe and North America this latter vector is more widespread.\u00a0\u00a0DENV has four serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4). Infection with one serotype provides long-term immunity to the same serotype and only transient immunity to the other serotypes, after which secondary infections with a different serotype increase the risk for severe dengue. Dengue cases are most commonly asymptomatic or result in mild febrile illness. However, some cases will develop severe dengue, which may involve shock, severe bleeding or severe organ impairment. This stage often starts after the fever has gone away and it is preceded by warning signs such as intense abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, bleeding gums, fluid accumulation, lethargy or restlessness, and liver enlargement.\u00a0 \u00a0There is no specific treatment for dengue, but the timely diagnosis of dengue cases, identification of warning signs for severe dengue, and appropriate clinical management are key elements of care to prevent the progression to severe dengue and deaths.",
        "Public Health Response": "Heterogeneity in capacity across Member States impacts the ability to detect and respond to DENV endemic and epidemic transmission. While the majority of the countries in the Americas, South-East Asian and Western-Pacific regions are endemic for the disease and have the capacity to manage cases, a few countries do not mandate reporting of dengue cases and thus under- or non-reporting of cases results in pockets of vulnerability within regions. Simultaneous outbreaks across multiple WHO regions strain the capacity for epidemic response. The overall capacity to respond to multiple, concurrent outbreaks continues to be strained due to the global lack of resources, including shortages of good quality dengue diagnostic kits for early detection, lack of trained clinical and vector control staff, and lack of resources to support risk community and community engagement interventions. Prevention and control of dengue continue to be variable due to changes in the predominant circulating serotypes and co-circulation of multiple dengue serotypes in the different regions, limited funding, competing health priorities and diverse perceptions about the effectiveness of interventions and control measures. Surveillance and response capacity is particularly limited in many countries in the African region, and as stated earlier, five of the Eastern Mediterranean Member States with DENV are dealing with conflicts and natural disasters.\u00a0\u00a0There is a pressing need to increase advocacy and resource mobilization in an integrated approach to influence policymakers in affected countries within these regions.\u202f\u00a0The following activities are being undertaken at WHO to support Member States in the response to this event.\u00a0\u00a0Coordination and leadership\u00a0Establishment of a Global Joint Incident Management Support Team (IMST) at WHO, involving WHO Health Emergencies Programme (Response and Preparedness departments) and technical expertise from the Neglected Tropical Disease department to support the response to outbreaks.\u202fImplementation of integrated response aligned with the overarching Global Arbovirus Initiative.\u202f\u202f\u202fThe Global Arbovirus Initiative is an integrated strategic plan to tackle emerging and re-emerging arboviruses with epidemic and pandemic potential focusing on monitoring risk, pandemic prevention, preparedness, detection and response, and building a coalition of partners.

        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Recent data from 2023 emphasize escalated dengue outbreaks in several countries, particularly Bangladesh, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Fiji, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Viet Nam. Additionally, non-endemic countries are increasingly facing dengue as a significant public health concern. The emergence and re-emergence of dengue and its unprecedented worldwide spread are linked to various factors:\u202f i) Changing distribution and adaptation of the Aedes aegypti vector; ii) increased unplanned urbanization and human activities fostering conducive environments for vector-host interaction; iii) Climate change-induced shifts in weather patterns; iv) Fragile healthcare systems amidst political and financial instabilities; v) Co-circulation of multiple dengue serotypes; vi) Challenges in clinical diagnosis due to non-specific symptoms; vii) Inadequate laboratory and testing capacity; viii) Prolonged ongoing concurrent outbreaks, including COVID-19; ix) Lack of specific treatment for dengue; x) Limited behavioral data available on community risk perceptions, awareness and health seeking behaviors: xi) Lack of community centered approach and RCCE resources to support engagement and mobilization of local communities in vector control activities; xi) Insufficient vector surveillance and control capacities and, xii) Lack of coordination among stakeholders, chronic underfunding,\u202f low donor interest and xii) large scale movement of people and goods.\u202f\u202f\u00a0The expansion of DENV beyond its endemic transmission areas presents additional challenges.\u00a0 A significant population that is immunologically na\u00efve to the current virus circulating, increasing the risk of outbreaks. Moreover, people in these areas might lack awareness of dengue warning signs, leading to potential delays in seeking health care which is critical to reducing mortality from severe disease.\u202f\u202fAccessibility challenges to medical facilities, compounded by limited geographical access, heighten the difficulty in accessing basic healthcare services. \u202fThese challenges are aggravated by stockouts of essential supplies for prevention and control, laboratory diagnostic reagents, and the need for ongoing training of healthcare workers.\u202f\u00a0These factors, along with others, including financial crises, mass migration of internally displaced persons (IDPs) and refugees, and longstanding developmental inadequacies, have deprived large populations across all continents of adequate healthcare, consequently increasing their vulnerability to dengue. However, it is important to note that the distribution of dengue risk varies significantly across regions, countries, and within countries.\u202f\u202f\u00a0Based on all the above WHO has assessed the risk at global level as high. Following the risk assessment and an internal grading process, WHO Regional Offices have agreed on priority interventions to implement in support of Member States.\u00a0Dengue prevention and outbreak response involves several agencies in the public health sector. Addressing these challenges requires a multidisciplinary and multisectoral integrated approach, especially at national level to achieve its goal of reducing the impact on public health. The strain on epidemic response capacity due to simultaneous concurrent outbreaks coupled with political crises highlights the need for robust emergency response mechanisms and strengthened collaboration among stakeholders. The global lack of resources, including shortages of good quality dengue diagnostic kits for early detection, lack of trained clinical and vector control personnel, and community awareness remain a critical obstacle to an effective response. While coordination efforts with global health organizations like WHO and other partners strive to set common priorities and analyses, the need for continuous support to affected countries and enhanced collaboration is imperative.",
        "WHO Advice": "Effective vector control measures:\u00a0Effective vector control is key to the prevention and control of the DENV. Vector control activities should target all areas where there is a risk of human-vector contact, such as residences, workplaces, schools, and hospitals. WHO promotes Integrated Vector Management (IVM) to control Aedes species. IVM should include removing potential breeding sites, reducing vector populations, and minimizing individual exposure. This should involve vector control strategies for larvae and adults (i.e., environmental management and source reduction), especially monitoring water storage practices, draining and cleaning household water storage containers weekly, larvicide in non-potable water using WHO-prequalified larvicides at correct dosages, distribution of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) for fever/dengue inpatients to contain spread of the virus from health facilities. Indoor space spraying for rapidly containing dengue-infected mosquitoes may be challenging to deliver in densely populated areas.\u202f\u202f\u00a0The Global Arbovirus Initiative promotes coordination and collaboration among multisectoral partners, an integrated vector management approach and sustained control measures at all levels. Its guiding principle is to harmonize prevention, surveillance (entomological and epidemiological) and case management with existing health systems, such that they are sustainable, cost-effective and ecologically sound.\u00a0\u00a0Personal Protective Measures:\u00a0\u00a0Personal protective measures during outdoor activities include topical repellents to exposed skin or the treatment of clothing and using long-sleeved shirts and pants. Additionally, indoor protection can include the use of household insecticide aerosol products, or mosquito coils during the day. Window and door screens can reduce the probability of mosquitoes entering the house. Insecticide-treated nets offer good protection to people against mosquito bites while sleeping during the day. Since Aedes mosquitoes are most active at dawn and dusk, personal protective measures are recommended particularly at these times of day. Personal protection measures and mosquito control should also cover workplaces and schools since the vectors are day-biting mosquitoes.\u202f\u00a0Entomological Surveillance:\u00a0Entomological surveillance should be undertaken to assess the breeding potential of Aedes mosquitoes in containers and monitor insecticide resistance to help select the most effective insecticide-based interventions.\u202f\u00a0Case management:\u00a0There is no specific treatment for dengue infection. However, early detection and access to appropriate healthcare for case management can reduce mortality, as can rapid detection of severe dengue cases and timely referrals to tertiary healthcare facilities.\u202f\u202f\u00a0Most people with dengue have mild or no symptoms and will get better in 1\u20132 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0Individuals who are infected for the second time are at greater risk of severe dengue. Severe dengue symptoms often come after the fever has gone away such as:\u00a0severe abdominal pain\u00a0persistent vomiting\u00a0rapid breathing bleeding gums or nose\u00a0\u00a0fatigue restlessness blood in vomit or stool being very thirsty pale and cold skin feeling weak. People with these severe symptoms should get care right away.\u00a0Enhanced case surveillance:\u00a0Case surveillance should be enhanced in all affected countries and globally. Where feasible, resources should be allocated for the strengthening of surveillance to determine the overall dengue burden (i.e., including outpatient cases), counting severe and fatal cases, and for the confirmation and sub-typing of the dengue virus.\u202f\u202f\u00a0Operational research and learning from successful examples:\u00a0Countries must learn and adopt successful examples of effective case management, prevention, community engagement, and vector control of dengue and other arboviruses through heightened research projects, particularly given the recent WHO recommendations on clinical trials.\u00a0\u00a0Ministries of Health and partners should closely review local interventions to accept and recommend them for public health programmes for early adaptation to reduce the growing health impact of dengue.\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u00a0WHO does not recommend that any general travel or trade restrictions be applied to countries/territories/areas based on the available information.",

        "Date Reported": "8 December 2023",
        "Location": "Zambia",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 1 November 2023, the International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Point of Zambia notified WHO of an anthrax outbreak in humans. The first human cases were reported from the Dengeza Health Post in the Sinazongwe District of the Southern Province on 5 May 2023. Around the same time period, domestic (cattle and goats) and wild animals (hippopotami) were reportedly dying from an unknown cause in the surrounding areas. In June 2023, human and animal cases were reported in the Kanchindu and Siameja veterinary camps of Sinazongwe District. Twenty-six human cases developed sores on their face, arms, and fingers after consuming meat from three wild hippopotamus carcasses. The first human case was reported on 16 June 2023 and laboratory confirmed by culture at the Lusaka Central Veterinary Research Institute (CVRI).\nAs of 20 November 2023, 684 suspected human cases, including four deaths, a Case Fatality Ratio (CFR)of 0.6%, were reported from 44 out of 116 districts in nine of Zambia\u2019s 10 provinces. Sinazongwe district is the epicenter, accounting for 287 cases (42% of total 684 cases) and two deaths (50% of total the four deaths). The most affected provinces are the Southern (370 cases; 54 %), Western (88; 13%), Lusaka (82; 12%), Eastern (66; 10%) and Muchinga (47; 7 %) Provinces. The majority of symptomatic cases were epidemiologically linked to confirmed cases and not tested.\nThis unprecedented outbreak marks the first major occurrence spanning nine out of 10 country provinces. The latest large-scale outbreak reported in Zambia occurred in 2011 with a total of 511 suspected cases.\nResponse activities have been taken from both human and animal sides, such as active surveillance, case management, laboratory diagnosis, health promotion, and Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE), meat inspection and livestock vaccination.\nAnthrax is a zoonotic disease caused by a bacteria called Bacillus anthracis that typically affects ruminants (such as cows, sheep, and goats). The bacteria produce extremely potent toxins which are responsible for the symptoms, causing a high lethality rate in the pulmonary form. Humans can develop the disease from infected animals or through contaminated animal products. Hospitalization is required for all human cases identified. Vaccines are available for livestock and humans in limited supply.\nThe risk of the event spreading within Zambia is assessed to be high due to the unrestricted animal movement and carcasses within and between provinces. The risk at the regional level is also considered high due to the frequent movement of both animals and people between Zambia and its neighbouring countries (such as Angola, Botswana, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe).",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 1 November 2023, the IHR National Focal Point of Zambia notified WHO of an anthrax outbreak in humans. The first human cases were reported from the Dengeza Health Post in the Sinazongwe District of the Southern Province on 5 May 2023. Around the same period, domestic (cattle and goats) and wild animals (hippopotami) were reportedly dying from an unknown cause in the surrounding areas. While Zambia typically reports sporadic cases of anthrax annually, the investigation revealed that from September 2022 to January 2023, 42 suspected cases of anthrax in humans had been recorded at the Dengeza Health Post. All the cases presented at health facilities with skin sores and ulcers, and some of them developed nonspecific symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, difficulty in breathing). Human specimens were collected during the investigation and sent to the Lusaka Central Veterinary Research Institute (CVRI) for testing. The initial samples collected and tested by culture returned negative for anthrax.In June 2023, human and animal cases were reported in the Kanchindu and Siameja veterinary camps of Sinazongwe district.\u00a0 Twenty-six human cases developed sores on their face, arms, and fingers after consuming meat from three wild hippopotamus carcasses. The first human case was reported on 16 June 2023 and laboratory confirmed by culture at the Lusaka CVRI. On the animal side, 13 domestic animals including cattle (10) and goats (3) out of Sinazongwe district susceptible population of 65 000 (30 000 cattle and 35 000 goats), under free range extensive traditional management, died of suspected anthrax. Cattle and goat specimens tested by culture at the Lusaka CVRI returned positive for anthrax on 17 July 2023. Until 1 November, anthrax outbreaks affecting animals and humans were reported in other Southern, Northwestern, and Western provinces. As of 20 November 2023, 684 suspected human cases, including four deaths (CFR 0.6%) were reported from 44 out of 116 districts in nine of Zambia\u2019s 10 provinces. Sinazongwe district is the epicenter, accounting for 287 cases (42% of total 684 cases) and two deaths (50% of total the four deaths).\u00a0 The most affected provinces are the Southern (370 cases; 54 %), Western (84; 12%), Lusaka (82; 12%), Eastern (66; 10%) and Muchinga (47; 7 %) Provinces. The majority of symptomatic cases were epidemiologically linked to confirmed cases and not tested.On the animal side, as of 21 November 2023, 568 domestic and wild animal cases were reported across 11 districts in Eastern, Southern, and Western provinces, with (344; 61%) occurring in the Southern province, (132; 23%) in the Muchinga province and (62, 11%) in the Western Province. Cases in wildlife, primarily hippos, were reported in the Eastern and Southern provinces.This outbreak marks the first major occurrence spanning nine out of 10 country provinces. Previous outbreaks were confined to Northwest and Western provinces, with sporadic cases over the years. Of note, Zambia reported anthrax outbreaks in both human and animals in Western Province in 2017 and in Eastern Province in 2016 and 2011.Figure 1. Distribution of anthrax cases by province, Zambia, as of 20 November 2023",
        "Epidemiology": "Anthrax is a disease caused by a spore-forming bacteria called Bacillus anthracis. It is a zoonosis (disease transmissible from animals to humans) that affects ruminants (such as cows, sheep, and goats). Anthrax does not typically spread from animal to animal or human to human. \u00a0When anthrax spores are ingested from contaminated animal products, inhaled, or enter the body through skin abrasions or cuts, they can germinate, multiply and produce toxins. Depending on the type of exposure, within a few hours to three weeks, individuals may present one of the three clinical presentations of anthrax. Cutaneous or skin anthrax is the most common presenting with an itchy bump in the exposed area that rapidly develops into a black sore. Some people then develop headaches, muscle aches, fever, and vomiting. Gastrointestinal anthrax causes initial symptoms similar to food poisoning, but can worsen to produce severe abdominal pain, vomiting of blood and severe diarrhoea. Pulmonary anthrax, the most severe presentation, has initial symptomatology of a common cold but can rapidly progress to severe breathing difficulties and shock. Diagnosis can be made through polychrome methylene blue-stained blood smears, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Hospitalization is required for all human cases identified. Individuals exposed may receive prophylactic treatment. Antibiotics, particularly penicillin, are effective against this disease. Prompt treatment can reduce case-fatality rate to <1%. Vaccines are also available for livestock and humans in limited supply.\u00a0 Human vaccines are limited to those with possible occupational exposure.",
        "Public Health Response": "Response activities have been taken from both human and animal sides. Actions taken for animalsWith the support of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), livestock vaccination is ongoing. In total 338 000 doses of anthrax vaccine have been distributed up to 19 November 2023. Vaccination campaigns have been initiated at the outbreak epicentre, Sinazongwe district, and is extended to other affected districts. A joint One Health task force comprising the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Local Government has been conducting case finding in animals and humans. Meat inspection is enhanced by the veterinary department. \u00a0Additionally, the Department of Wildlife and Parks has been actively involved, conducting patrols to monitor illegal animal movements and ensuring proper disposal of carcasses. WHO is working closely with FAO and the Ministry of Agriculture on animal health activities like vaccination.Actions implemented for humansWHO is supporting and working closely with the Ministry of Health in the following activities. For case management, health workers have undergone orientation to enhance their capacities to identify potential cases early on. Efforts have been made to strengthen event-based surveillance (EBS) and early detection mechanisms. Provision of essential medical supplies has been prioritized, in addition to public sensitization. Active surveillance is ongoing across healthcare facilities and within communities, including contact tracing.Meat inspections are being conducted in abattoirs and butcher shops. Preparedness plans are in place, including the mobilization of additional healthcare personnel to districts, foreseeing a potential surge in anthrax cases. Moreover, specialized training sessions for provincial practitioners aim to improve case management proficiency in the provinces.The laboratory continues to operate under a unified One Health approach for diagnostics. Procurement efforts for laboratory reagents are underway due to shortages. Strict protocols for disinfection and decontamination remain ongoing to ensure safety. Extensive health promotion and Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE) activities are ongoing, including press briefings by Ministry of Health, social media campaigns, radio broadcasts, and the distribution of informative brochures and posters.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Anthrax is endemic in Zambia, usually occurring between May and January, with a peak toward the end of the dry season (between October and November). Although sporadic cases are reported yearly in animals and humans across the country, a large-scale outbreak like the current one has not been reported since 2011, when there were 511 suspected human cases.The epidemic is spreading along the provinces located along the basin of the Zambezi, Kafue, and Luangwa rivers, which is an additional problem because these rivers also flow into Lake Kariba in Zimbabwe, Kahora Bassa in Mozambique and Lake Malawi, and the risk of anthrax transmission to neighbouring countries is increased.Other affected districts and provinces of Zambia have reported sporadic suspected cases and deaths since June 2023. In addition, the Bacillus anthracis bacteria can form highly resistant spores that survive in the environment for decades The risk for human health is high given the known population\u2019s multiple exposures from handling the carcasses of animals that had died suddenly and eating meat from infected animals with resultant associated cutaneous and gastrointestinal anthrax. The risk of the event spreading within Zambia has increased due to the unrestricted animal movement and carcasses within and between provinces. Since September 2023, there has been a significant rise in the number of affected districts. Moreover, a low index of suspicion, socio-cultural norms, community resistance, limited community knowledge regarding anthrax transmission, high levels of poverty and food insecurity, a shortage of available vaccines and laboratory reagents, inadequate carcass disposal and decontamination practices significantly contribute to hampering the containment of the anthrax outbreak. There is an absence of robust engagement with local communities involved in breeding and handling cattle and livestock, including farmers, heads of cattle markets, and butchers. Among these communities, the fear of losing livelihoods often outweighs concerns about contracting anthrax. The risk of insufficient control capacities is considered high in Zambia due to concurrent public health emergencies in the country (cholera, measles, COVID-19) that limit the country\u2019s human and financial capacities to respond to the current anthrax outbreak adequately.The risk at the regional level is also considered high due to the frequent movement of both animals and people between Zambia and its neighbouring countries (such as Angola, Botswana, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe). This is compounded by the confirmed cases of anthrax spreading in provinces located along the basin of the Zambezi, Kafue, and Luangwa rivers. These rivers ultimately flow into Lake Kariba in Zimbabwe, the Kahora Bassa lake in Mozambique, and Lake Malawi. Unburied carcasses of wild animals that float on the river increase the risk of international spread to neighbouring countries. They can spread the bacterium and infections to other regions, including neighbouring countries, and be eaten by other animals, which can further perpetuate the spread.",
        "WHO Advice": "Humans usually acquire the infection after exposure to infected animals, carcasses, or animal products. More than 95% of human anthrax cases take the cutaneous form and result from handling infected carcasses or hides, hair, meat or bones from such carcasses. The public should avoid handling and consumption of meat from animals that died suddenly, meat obtained via emergency slaughter, and meat of uncertain origin. Anthrax can also be an occupational hazard for veterinarians, agriculture and wildlife workers, or workers who butcher animals or process meat, hides, hair, and wool and should wear preventive clothing and gloves or personal protection equipment (PPE). In health-care settings, it is crucial to enhance screening procedures specifically in areas where there is a known epidemiological risk of anthrax. It is imperative to anticipate and implement infection prevention and control measures promptly when cases are suspected. When caring for patients with draining anthrax lesions, implementing contact precautions is vital. This includes placing the patient in a private room and the use of PPE (such as examination gloves and a fluid resistant gown). Additionally, dressings may be used to contain drainage and reduce the risk of environmental contamination. These dressings should be disposed of as infectious waste after use. The WHO\u2019s 5 Moments for hand hygiene should be practiced using soap and water when caring for suspected and confirmed cases, as alcohol-based hand rub has weakened effect against spores. For areas where patients with suspected or confirmed exposure to anthrax spores are being cared for, it is recommended to implement enhanced cleaning and disinfection protocols.Individuals potentially exposed to anthrax spores should receive prophylactic treatment. Anthrax responds well to antibiotics, which need to be prescribed by a medical professional. Strict adherence to the full course of treatment is vital. Human vaccines are in limited supply and used primarily for the protection of selected individuals with possible occupational exposure to anthrax.International travelers to anthrax endemic countries should be aware of regulations concerning the importation of prohibited animal products, trophies, and souvenirs.Anthrax is controlled through animal vaccination programs, rapid detection and reporting, quarantine, treatment of sub clinically affected animals (postexposure prophylaxis) and burning or burial of suspect and confirmed animal cases. The carcass should not be opened since exposure to oxygen will allow the bacteria to form spores. The general public and at-risk individuals should immediately report instances of sick or unexpected deaths in animals to veterinary authorities. Veterinary vaccines are used for control of anthrax in livestock. Vaccination protocols for livestock should be strictly followed to curb anthrax spread. Preventing the disease in animals will protect human health. \u00a0WHO advises against implementing any travel or trade restrictions based on the current information available on this event.",

        "Outbreak name": "Influenza A(H1N2) variant virus infection",
        "Date Reported": "1 December 2023",
        "Location": "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 25 November 2023, the International Health Regulations National Focal Point (IHR NFP) of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (United Kingdom) notified the World Health Organization (WHO) of a human case of swine-origin influenza A(H1N2) virus infection. This is the first swine influenza A(H1N2)v case reported in the United Kingdom. Human infections with swine-origin influenza viruses have been sporadically detected in the past in countries in the Americas, Asia, Australia and Europe.\nWhen a human is infected with a swine-origin influenza virus, the virus is referred to as a variant (or \u201cv\u201d) virus. Most human cases result from exposure to swine influenza viruses through direct contact with infected swine or contaminated environments. Current evidence suggests that these swine-origin influenza viruses have limited ability for sustained transmission among humans.\nThis case was identified as part of routine surveillance of respiratory illnesses. The source of infection for this case is under investigation and contact tracing is in process. To date, no other confirmed cases associated with this event have been reported. WHO is in communication with national authorities to monitor the situation closely. Ongoing investigations are in place to identify the source of the infection and to characterize the risks of this influenza variant virus.\nWHO assesses the risk of spread of swine-origin influenza viruses through humans and/or community-level spread among humans as low. However, because these viruses continue to be detected in swine populations worldwide, further human cases following direct or indirect contact with infected swine can be expected. Current evidence suggests that these viruses have not acquired the ability to sustain transmission among humans.\nDue to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect virological, epidemiological and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health and timely virus sharing for risk assessment.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 25 November 2023, under the IHR (2005), the United Kingdom notified the WHO of a human case of influenza A(H1N2)v virus infection. The case reported onset of mild symptoms on 5 November.\u00a0 He visited his general practitioner on 9 November; during this visit, a respiratory sample was collected and further analyzed as part of the national routine influenza surveillance programme. On 13 November, the sample was sent to United Kingdom Health Security Agency (UKHSA) laboratories and tested positive on 23 November for influenza A(H1N2)v virus, using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The sample was further characterized by whole genome sequencing and results were available on the same date. On 25 November, a follow-up RT-PCR test was performed and tested negative for influenza.\u00a0\u00a0 The case is now fully recovered.\u00a0Further laboratory analyses conducted at the Worldwide Influenza Centre at the Francis Crick Institute (a WHO Collaborating Centre) and the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH) avian and swine influenza reference laboratory at the Animal and Plant Health Agency, indicated that this influenza A(H1N2)v virus belongs to the swine influenza virus genetic clade 1B.1.1. Similar A(H1N2) viruses from this genetic clade have been previously detected in pigs in the United Kingdom. However, this is the first time a virus from this swine genetic clade has been detected in a human in the United Kingdom.\u00a0According to ongoing investigations, pig farms are located within a few miles of where the case resides; however, the case reported no direct exposure to pigs, pets, or farms.\u00a0 The source of infection is currently under investigation and contact tracing is continuing.",
        "Epidemiology": "Influenza A viruses are enzootic in swine populations in most regions of the world. When an influenza virus that normally circulates in swine is detected in a person, it is called a \u201cvariant influenza virus\u201d. A(H1N1), A(H1N2) and A(H3N2) are major subtypes of influenza viruses circulating in pigs and occasionally infect humans.\u00a0Sporadic human infections with swine influenza viruses have been reported since the late 1950s, usually after direct or indirect exposure to pigs or contaminated environments. Since 2018, sporadic influenza A(H1N2)v cases among humans have been detected in other countries in Europe (Austria, Denmark, France and the Netherlands), the Americas (Brazil, Canada and the United States of America), Asia (China) and in Australia. Infections in humans have primarily been acquired through direct contact with infected animals or contaminated environments. Risk factors include proximity to infected pigs or visiting locations where pigs are exhibited. However, in some cases, no known exposure to swine was reported.\u00a0Swine-origin influenza virus infections in humans tend to result in mild clinical illness, although some cases have been hospitalized with more severe disease and some have been fatal. Evidence of human-to-human spread of swine-origin influenza viruses is limited, and human-to-human onward transmissions are very rare or limited to one or two generations of infection.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Laboratory testing with RT-PCR or other rapid molecular influenza assays (with similar high sensitivity and high specificity) are recommended when available. However, prompt treatment based on antivirals and supportive care should be the priority. WHO has produced guidelines for laboratory diagnosis of influenza and clinical management, and through the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), WHO closely monitors avian, swine and other zoonotic influenza viruses.",
        "Public Health Response": "WHO is closely collaborating with national authorities to monitor the situation. UKHSA has established an enhanced national incident team that is working with partners to investigate this incident and deliver a rapid response. Ongoing response activities by the UKHSA, the United Kingdom National Health Service and international partners include:\u00a0Local epidemiological investigations and public health management, have been implemented, including case investigation, contact tracing and enhanced local surveillance for persons with occupational exposure to pigs/farms and the wider local community.\u00a0Laboratory investigations are being conducted in collaboration with the UKHSA, Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) and the Crick Institute laboratories to further understand the virological characteristics of this virus.\u00a0\u00a0Communications activities, including ensuring proportionate communications to partners within government, with the National Health Service and international partners, have been implemented.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Influenza viruses circulate in swine populations in many regions of the world. Depending on geographic location, the genetic characteristics of these viruses differ. Most human cases result from exposure to swine influenza viruses through contact with infected swine or contaminated environments, although some cases have been reported without an apparent source of exposure to swine in the weeks prior to illness onset. Because these viruses continue to be detected in swine populations worldwide, further human cases following direct or indirect contact with infected swine can be expected.\u00a0Current evidence suggests that these viruses have not acquired the ability to sustain transmission among humans. There has been limited, non-sustained human-to-human transmission of variant influenza viruses, although ongoing community transmission has not been identified.\u00a0This is the first swine influenza A(H1N2)v case reported in the United Kingdom. There is no clear indication of direct contact with pigs or any ill individuals.\u00a0 Though the source of infection is unknown at this time, the virus is closely aligned to that circulating in the swine population in the United Kingdom. Several previous variant cases have also not had clear exposure histories to swine and there was no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission in these cases. Limited human-to-human transmission may have played a role, but there is no definitive evidence.\u00a0Further virus characterization is ongoing. National routine surveillance indicators do not show any unusual increases in respiratory illness in the local population. The risk of there being additional human cases associated with this event appears to be low \u2013 though the possibility of limited person-to-person transmission cannot be excluded at this stage.\u00a0The risk assessment will be reviewed should further epidemiological or virological information become available.",
        "WHO Advice": "People with any respiratory symptoms should continue to follow the existing guidance, seek healthcare and avoid contact with other people while symptoms persist, particularly if the people they are coming into contact with are elderly or have existing medical conditions.\u00a0Surveillance:\u00a0This case does not change the current WHO recommendations on public health measures and seasonal influenza surveillance.\u00a0WHO does not advise special traveler screening at points of entry or restrictions concerning the current situation of influenza viruses at the human-animal interface.\u00a0 Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect virological, epidemiological and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health and timely virus sharing for risk assessment. Notification and investigation:\u00a0\u00a0All human infections caused by a novel influenza subtype are notifiable under the IHR (2005) and State Parties are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic. Evidence of illness is not required.\u00a0In the case of a confirmed or suspected human infection caused by a novel influenza virus with pandemic potential, including a variant virus, a thorough epidemiologic investigation of a history of exposure to animals, travel, and contact tracing should be conducted. The epidemiologic investigation should include early identification of unusual respiratory events that could signal person-to-person transmission of the novel virus. Clinical samples collected from the time and place of the case should be tested and sent to a WHO Collaboration Centre for further characterization.\u00a0\u00a0Prevention measures:\u00a0General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.\u00a0Travelers to countries with known outbreaks of animal influenza should avoid farms, contact with animals in live animal markets, entering areas where animals may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with animal feces. Travelers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travelers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices. Influenza viruses that infect pigs are different from human influenza viruses. There is no vaccine for zoonotic influenza infection licensed for use in humans. However, some partners have developed candidate vaccine viruses for novel zoonotic influenza viruses with pandemic potential as part of pandemic preparedness activities.\u00a0Usually, influenza vaccines against human influenza viruses are generally not expected to protect people from influenza viruses that normally circulate in pigs. Although the seasonal influenza vaccine does not protect against swine viruses, WHO recommends seasonal influenza vaccination to avoid severe disease.\u00a0In health-care settings, syndromic screening of health and care workers, patients, and visitors for symptoms of respiratory infections is recommended, accompanied with capacity and resources to implement transmission-based precautions to reduce the risk of health care-associated infections. If a case of a novel acute respiratory infection is suspected, please refer to advice in the WHO guideline for infection prevention and control of epidemic-and pandemic prone acute respiratory infections in health care. WHO does not recommend any travel and/or trade restrictions for the United Kingdom based on the currently available information.",

        "Date Reported": "29 November 2023",
        "Location": "Cambodia",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "Between 24 and 25 November 2023, the Ministry of Health of Cambodia notified WHO of two confirmed cases of human infection with influenza A(H5N1) from the same village in Kampot Province. Both cases were female, one in the 20-25 years age group and the other less than five years old. The first reported case visited a public hospital four days after having symptoms of fever, shortness of breath and cough. Samples were collected, which tested positive for H5N1, and the case died while in hospital. The second reported case was detected during enhanced surveillance by the public health authorities in response to the confirmation of the first reported case. The case had fever, cough and rash and is currently being treated in hospital. Epidemiological investigation shows both cases had exposure to backyard birds, which were reported to be sick, with some having died, over the prior month.\nThe Ministry of Health's national and sub-national rapid response teams are investigating the source of the infection and coordinating response activities, including but not limited to active surveillance for additional cases, identifying close contacts for monitoring, and conducting health education campaigns to prevent transmission in the community.\nIn total, six cases of influenza A(H5N1) have been reported from Cambodia this year. Influenza A(H5N1) infection in humans can cause severe disease, has a high mortality rate, and is notifiable under the International Health Regulations (2005).",
        "Description of the Situation": "The Ministry of Health of Cambodia notified WHO of two confirmed human cases of influenza A (H5N1) between 24 and 25 November 2023. The cases resided in the same village in Kampot Province. Both cases were females, one in the age group of 20-25 years and the other less than 5 years old. The first reported case developed fever, cough and shortness of breath on 19 November 2023, was treated at home for several days, and then visited a hospital on 23 November. At the hospital, samples were collected and transported to the National Institute of Public Health for testing and was subsequently confirmed as influenza A(H5N1) by RT-qPCR assays at the National Laboratory at National Institute of Public Health and reconfirmed by Institute Pasteur du Cambodge. The case was admitted and in intensive care at the hospital and passed away on 26 November 2023. The second reported case was detected during active surveillance in response to the first reported case, for additional cases with clinical presentation including fever, cough and rash. The case was transported to hospital on 25 November 2023 for testing with samples returning positive for influenza A(H5N1) by RT-qPCR assays at the National Laboratory at National Institute of Public Health and reconfirmed by at the Institute Pasteur du Cambodge. The case is currently admitted in an isolation room in the respiratory ward of the hospital and undergoing treatment. Epidemiological investigation shows both cases had exposure to backyard birds which were reported to be sick and dead, over the past month. No epidemiological linkage of these cases has yet been confirmed other than that they both resided in the same village.Laboratory investigation shows the viruses, as indicated by phylogenetic analysis, fall within the H5 clade 2.3.2.1c with close similarity to the viruses that have been circulating in Cambodia and Southeast Asia since 2013-2014. The sequences cluster most closely with the viruses from the two human cases reported in October 2023.",
        "Epidemiology": "Animal influenza viruses normally circulate in animals but can also infect humans. Infections in humans have primarily been acquired through direct contact with infected animals or contaminated environments. Depending on the original host, influenza A viruses can be classified as avian influenza, swine influenza, or other types of animal influenza viruses.Avian, swine, and other animal influenza virus infections in humans may cause disease ranging from mild upper respiratory tract infection to more severe diseases and can be fatal. Conjunctivitis, gastrointestinal symptoms, encephalitis and encephalopathy have also been reported. There have also been several detections of A(H5N1) virus in asymptomatic persons but who had exposure to infected birds in the days before a sample was collected.Laboratory tests are required to diagnose human infection with influenza. WHO periodically updates technical guidance protocols for the detection of zoonotic influenza using molecular methods, e.g. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Evidence suggests that some antiviral drugs, notably neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir), can reduce the duration of viral replication and improve prospects of survival in some cases.The confirmed cases are the fifth and sixth cases of human infection with influenza A(H5N1) reported from Cambodia in 2023, and the fourth reported death in 2023. From 2003 until now, 62 cases of human infection with influenza A(H5N1), including 41 deaths, have been reported from Cambodia.",
        "Public Health Response": "The Ministry of Health's national and sub-national rapid response teams, with support from the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, and the Ministry of Environment, have initiated and coordinated the detailed investigation of the avian influenza outbreak in Kampot Province including searching for additional suspected cases and contacts, collecting and testing samples from backyard birds and conducting health education campaigns to prevent transmission in the community.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "From 2003 to 27 November 2023, a total of 882 human cases of infection with influenza A(H5N1), including 461 deaths, have been reported globally from 23 countries. Almost all cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) have been linked to close contact with infected live or dead birds, or influenza A(H5N1)-contaminated environments. Based on evidence so far, the virus does not infect humans easily and spread from person-to-person appears to be unusual. Human infection can cause severe disease and has a high mortality rate. Since the virus continues to circulate in poultry, particularly in rural areas in Cambodia, the potential for further sporadic human cases can be expected. In these two cases, while human-to-human transmission cannot be ruled out, it is likely there were separate exposures to the viruses from sick and dead chickens. In the past, small clusters of A(H5) virus infections were reported, including those involving health care workers, but without evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission. Available epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that A(H5N1) viruses have not acquired the ability to sustain transmission among humans. Therefore, the likelihood of sustained human-to-human spread is low. Based on available information so far, WHO assesses the risk to the general population posed by this virus to be low.\u00a0The risk assessment will be reviewed as needed if additional information becomes available.\u00a0 Close analysis of the epidemiological situation, further characterization of the most recent influenza A(H5N1) viruses in both human and poultry populations, and serological investigations are critical to assess associated risks to public health and promptly adjust risk management measures. There are no specific vaccines for influenza A(H5N1) in humans. However, candidate vaccines to prevent influenza A(H5) infection in humans have been developed for pandemic preparedness in some countries. WHO continues to update the\u00a0list of zoonotic influenza candidate vaccine viruses (CVV) selected twice a year at the WHO consultation on influenza virus vaccine composition. The list of such CVV is available on WHO website. In addition, the genetic and antigenic characterization of contemporary zoonotic influenza viruses are published on\u00a0the Global influenza programme, human-animal interface website.",
        "WHO Advice": "This event does not change the current WHO recommendations on influenza surveillance and public health measures. Given reports of sporadic influenza A (H5N1) cases in humans, outbreaks in mammals, the widespread circulation in birds and the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect and monitor virological, epidemiological, and clinical changes associated with emerging or circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health and timely virus sharing for risk assessment.The public should avoid contact with high-risk environments such as live animal markets/farms and live poultry, or surfaces that might be contaminated by poultry droppings. Additionally, it is recommended to maintain good hand hygiene with frequent washing or the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer.The general public and at-risk individuals should immediately report instances of sick or unexpected deaths in animals to veterinary authorities. Consumption of poultry or wild birds that are sick or have died unexpectedly should be avoided.Any person who has had exposure to potentially infected birds or contaminated environments and feels unwell, should seek health care promptly and inform their healthcare provider of their possible exposure. WHO advises against implementing any travel or trade restrictions based on the current information available on this event. WHO does not advise special traveler screening at points of entry or other restrictions due to the current situation of influenza viruses at the human-animal interface.State Parties to the International Health Regulations (2005) are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by a new subtype of influenza virus. Evidence of illness is not required for this notification.",

        "Date Reported": "23 November 2023",
        "Location": "Northern China",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "Since mid-October 2023, the World Health Organization (WHO) has been monitoring data from Chinese surveillance systems that have been showing an increase in respiratory illness in children in northern China.At a press conference on 13 November 2023, China\u2019s National Health Commission reported on a nationwide increase in the incidence of respiratory diseases, predominantly affecting children. Chinese authorities attributed this increase to lifting of COVID-19 restrictions and the arrival of the cold season, and due to circulating known pathogens such as influenza, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Mycoplasma pneumonia and RSV are known to affect children more than adults. On 22 November 2023, WHO identified media and ProMED reports about clusters of undiagnosed pneumonia in children's hospitals in Beijing, Liaoning and other places in China. Through the International Health Regulations mechanism, WHO made an official request to China to provide additional epidemiologic and clinical information, as well as laboratory results from these reported cases and data about recent trends in circulating respiratory pathogens. A key purpose was to identify whether there have been \u201cclusters of undiagnosed pneumonia\u201d in Beijing and Liaoning as referred to in media reports, and if so whether these were separate events, or part of the known general increase in respiratory illnesses in the community. WHO further reached out through clinical networks for additional information.On 23 November, WHO held a teleconference with Chinese health authorities from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the Beijing Children\u2019s Hospital, facilitated by the National Health Commission and the National Administration of Disease Control and Prevention, in which the requested data were provided, indicating an increase in outpatient consultations and hospital admissions of children due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia since May, and RSV, adenovirus and influenza virus since October. Some of these increases are earlier in the season than historically experienced, but not unexpected given the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions, as similarly experienced in other countries. No changes in the disease presentation were reported by the Chinese health authorities. Chinese authorities advised that there has been no detection of any unusual or novel pathogens or unusual clinical presentations, including in Beijing and Liaoning, but only the aforementioned general increase in respiratory illnesses due to multiple known pathogens. They further stated that the rise in respiratory illness has not resulted in patient loads exceeding hospital capacities.The Chinese authorities advised that, since mid-October, enhanced outpatient and inpatient surveillance has been implemented for respiratory illnesses covering a broad spectrum of viruses and bacteria, including, for the first time, Mycoplasma pneumoniae. This complements existing respiratory surveillance mechanisms and may have contributed to the observed increase in detection and reporting of respiratory illness in children.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "Since mid-October, in addition to enhancing disease surveillance in health care facilities and community settings, Chinese authorities have stressed the need to strengthen the capacity of the health system to manage patients. China has systems in place to capture information on trends in influenza, influenza-like illness (ILI), RSV and SARS-CoV-2, pneumonia and other severe acute respiratory infections (SARI), and reports influenza detections to platforms such as the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS). GISRS is led by WHO and used for the international virological and epidemiological surveillance of human influenza.WHO is closely monitoring the situation and is in close contact with national authorities in China. WHO will continue to provide updates as warranted.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "In the current outbreak of respiratory illness, the reported symptoms are common to several respiratory diseases and, as of now, at the present time, Chinese surveillance and hospital systems report that the clinical manifestations are caused by known pathogens in circulation. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common respiratory pathogen and a common cause of paediatric pneumonia, and is readily treated with antibiotics.China has an influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) sentinel surveillance system. Since mid-October, China has implemented enhanced surveillance systems for respiratory illness covering a broad spectrum of respiratory viruses and bacteria, including Mycoplasma pneumoniae.There is limited detailed information available to fully characterize the overall risk of these reported cases of respiratory illness in children. However, due to the arrival of the winter season, the increasing trend in respiratory illnesses is expected; co-circulation of respiratory viruses may increase burden on health care facilities.According to surveillance data reported to WHO\u2019s FluNet and published by the National Influenza Centre in China, ILI was above usual levels for this time of year and increasing in the northern provinces. Influenza detections were predominantly A(H3N2) and B/Victoria lineage viruses.",
        "WHO Advice": "Based on the available information, WHO recommends that people in China follow measures to reduce the risk of respiratory illness, which include recommended vaccines against influenza, COVID-19 and other respiratory pathogens as appropriate; keeping distance from people who are ill; staying home when ill; getting tested and medical care as needed; wearing masks as appropriate; ensuring good ventilation; and practicing regular handwashing.WHO does not recommend any specific measures for travellers to China. In general, persons should avoid travel while experiencing symptoms suggestive of respiratory illness, if possible; in case of symptoms during or after travel, travellers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share travel history with their health care provider.WHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions based on the current information available on this event.",

        "Outbreak name": "Mpox (monkeypox)",
        "Date Reported": "23 November 2023",
        "Location": "Democratic Republic of the Congo",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "Mpox is an infectious disease caused by monkeypox virus (MPXV), which is endemic in densely forested regions of West, Central and East Africa, particularly in the northern and central regions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Eleven of the 26 provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo are identified as endemic for mpox, but in more recent years the total number of mpox cases and the number of provinces reporting mpox has been expanding, to 22 provinces as of November 2023. There are two known clades of MPXV: clade I, previously known as the Congo Basin clade; and clade II, previously called the West African clade; clade II further has two subclades: clade IIa and clade IIb. Before 2018, very few cases were reported outside of the African continent: eight international travellers returning from endemic countries and one outbreak related to imported animals. Since 2022, an epidemic of clade IIb MPXV has been ongoing globally, affecting many countries outside the African continent that had never reported mpox previously. The spread of this epidemic was mainly driven by transmission via sexual contact among men who have sex with men. The Democratic Republic of the Congo has not reported cases of mpox linked to clade IIb MPXV during the global outbreak to date; only MPXV clade I has been detected in the country. Before April 2023, no formally documented cases of sexual transmission of clade I MPXV were registered globally. The first known cases were reported when a man, resident in Belgium and with connections to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, tested positive for clade I in Kenge, Kwango province, during a visit to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Thereafter, sexual contacts of this case in the Democratic Republic of the Congo also tested positive for clade I MPXV, with closely related viral sequences. This is the first time that reported clade I MPXV infection is linked to sexual transmission within a cluster. Another outbreak in the country is also being reported with multiple cases of mpox among sex workers. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, human-to-human transmission of mpox through close contact has been reported since the 1970s, mostly in small household or community outbreaks, presumed to be primarily due to zoonotic transmission. Due to a lack of timely access to diagnostics, difficulties with linking cases to any contact with infectious animals, and incomplete epidemiological and contact tracing investigations over the years, the dynamics of MPXV clade I transmission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are not well understood. These new features of sexual and unknown modes of transmission now raise additional concerns over the continuing rapid expansion of the outbreak in the country. In the global outbreak of mpox which began in 2022, clade IIb MPXV transmission between humans continues in most WHO regions. In addition, clade I MPXV community outbreaks occur regularly in three countries (Cameroon, Central African Republic, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo) and sporadically in others (e.g., Sudan, South Sudan). In some of these geographic areas in East, West and Central Africa, transmission from animals to humans is also presumed to occur. The natural reservoir of the virus is unknown; while various small mammals such as squirrels and monkeys are known to be susceptible, they have rarely been linked to outbreaks.",
        "Description of the Situation": "From 1 January through 12 November 2023, a total of 12 569 suspected mpox cases, including 581 suspected mpox deaths (case fatality ratio: 4.6%), have been reported in 156 health zones from 22 out of 26 (85%) provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. This is the highest number of annual cases ever reported, with new cases in geographic areas that had previously not reported mpox, including Kinshasa, Lualaba, and South Kivu. Among suspected cases, 1106 were tested by real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and 714 were positive for MPXV (positivity rate of 65%). Cases with travel history to endemic provinces have been driving chains of human-to-human transmission in non-affected provinces (Figure 1 & 2).Figure 1: Geographic distribution of suspected mpox cases by province, Democratic Republic of the Congo, 1 January \u2013 4 November 2023 (Epi weeks 1 to 44) Figure 2: Geographic distribution of confirmed mpox cases by province, Democratic Republic of the Congo, 1 January \u2013 7 October 2023 (epi weeks 1 to 40)First cases of sexually transmitted clade I MPXV:\u00a0The first cluster of suspected cases of sexually transmitted mpox was identified in Kenge, Kwango province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It included six confirmed cases, five men and one woman, with no deaths among the confirmed cases. The first known case is a man, resident of Belgium with connections to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who arrived in Kinshasa, on 15 March 2023 and started experiencing anal itching and discomfort the same day. On 16 March 2023, one day after arrival from Belgium, he travelled to the town of Kenge (260 km from Kinshasa). On 17 March, his anal lesion and genitals became painful blisters, and he developed further skin lesions on the trunk and buttocks. On 23 March, he consulted a doctor who suspected mpox, and a blood sample, oropharyngeal, rectal and vesicle swabs were performed on 24 March.\u00a0The patient tested positive by RT-PCR of biological samples at the National Institute of Biomedical Research (INRB) in Kinshasa and the result was shared with the Ministry of Health on 10 April. Genomic sequencing of the sample confirmed that it was clade I MPXV.\u00a0The individual\nidentified himself as a man who has sexual relations with other men. During his\ntravel in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, he visited discretely operating\nknown clubs of men who have sex with men and had several sexual contacts. He\nshowed symptoms on the day of his arrival in the country, and with the mpox\nincubation period most often being more than one day, available information\nsuggests that exposure took place outside the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nNonetheless, genetic analysis of the virus confirmed infection with a clade I\nstrain, similar to other strains circulating in the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo. Although the patient had no reported exposure to another person with\nconfirmed mpox, based on the epidemiological investigation exposure to mpox likely\noccurred in Belgium.\u00a0Epidemiological investigation following this first case identified several sexual and non-sexual contacts who were monitored over time for mpox signs and symptoms.\u00a0 Among 27 contacts identified and six tested, five sexual contacts tested positive for mpox: two were confirmed on 10 April and three on 18 April. Of these five contacts, three developed symptoms during their 21-day follow-up period. Two contacts who did not develop symptoms also tested positive by a mucous membrane sample. Of the five confirmed contact cases, four were men aged between 24 and 35 years old and one was a woman. The initial case confirmed having sexual contact with each of them. After his recovery from mpox he returned to Belgium on 5 May 2023.\u00a0This cluster of mpox cases represents the first documented sexual\ntransmission of MPXV Clade I. It is also the first described transmission of\nMPXV Clade I among men who have sex with men. Notably, there are clubs in Kenge\nfor men who have sex with men, some of whose members travel to visit other\nclubs within the country and outside the country, particularly in Europe and within\nCentral Africa. In the city of Kinshasa, there are more than 50 such clubs.\nSome members of these clubs also reside outside the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo. This event is unusual and highlights the risk that MPXV clade I could also\nwidely spread among sexual networks, as seen for clade II during the 2022-23\nglobal outbreak.\u00a0On 28 July 2023, another confirmed case of mpox was recorded in another man who had sex with men in Kenge town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The patient was a man residing in Kenge, with onset of the disease on 11 June 2023. He was not listed among the contacts of the first group of cases and the limited epidemiological investigation did not directly link him to the March-April cluster. Genome sequencing for this case has not been performed.\u00a0Further epidemiological investigations are being conducted to verify reports of new cases in this province. First mpox outbreak in KinshasaIn August 2023, for the first time, mpox cases were confirmed in Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Four separate events were identified where persons exposed in other provinces (Equateur, Maindombe) travelled to Kinshasa, each leading to local transmission with small clusters in the capital. Between 18 August and 12 November 2023, a total of 102 suspected cases were reported in eight health zones in Kinshasa, including 18 confirmed cases with one confirmed mpox death (case fatality ratio of 5.6% among confirmed cases).\u00a0The first confirmed case was in a person who arrived from the Maindombe province, where mpox is endemic, to Kinshasa by river boat. He was confirmed on August 18 and subsequently several of his close contacts developed symptoms and tested positive for MPXV. Additional imported confirmed cases were reported in Limete, Makala and Nsele health zones. The sex ratio among confirmed cases in Kinshasa is men 2: women 1, with a median age of 24 (95% CI 11-27) years.\u00a0 For the moment, 13 of the confirmed cases have recovered (including a health worker), one died and four are isolated and under treatment. The person who died also had tuberculosis and acquired mpox during hospitalization, indicating nosocomial transmission. \u00a0These new reports of human-to-human transmission of mpox in a large urban area such as Kinshasa clearly illustrate that the epidemiology of mpox in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is changing.\u00a0\u00a0First mpox outbreak in South KivuBefore 2023, South Kivu province had not reported mpox. The first confirmed case was a young trader who travelled from Kisangani, in Tshopo province, one of the mpox endemic provinces, a few days before the onset of symptoms on 26 September 2023. The first skin lesions were located on his genitals and later extended to the whole body. During the initial epidemiological investigation, 113 contacts were registered in Bukavu and Kamituga health zones. As of 22 November 2023, a total of 80 suspected and 34 confirmed cases (including 20 sex workers) of mpox have been reported in South Kivu mainly from the Kamituga health zone, with no deaths. Currently South Kivu province is grappling with conflict, displacement, food insecurity, and challenges in providing adequate humanitarian assistance, all of which have a profound impact on the local population, especially vulnerable groups, and might represent fertile ground for further spread of mpox.\u00a0Animal studiesThe natural reservoir of the monkeypox virus is unknown \u2013 various small mammals such as squirrels and monkeys can be infected, and non-human primates are known to be clinically susceptible. Over the decades, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and partners have carried out animal studies to better characterize the ecology of the virus and potential animal reservoirs or incidental hosts. Such studies have been carried out in the provinces of Equateur, Haut U\u00e9l\u00e9, Kwango, Kwilu, Ma\u00efndombe, Maniema, Sankuru, Sud Ubangi, Tshopo, and Tshuapa. Eco-epidemiolocal studies are ongoing with national and international research partners collaborating to determine reservoir and incidental hosts.",
        "Epidemiology": "Mpox (monkeypox) is an infectious disease caused by the monkeypox virus (MPXV). There are two known clades of MPXV: clade I, previously called the Congo Basin clade; and clade II, previously called the West Africa clade; clade II further has two subclades: clade IIa and clade IIb. The disease is caused by one of the two clades of MPXV transmitted between humans through close contact with lesions, body fluids, respiratory droplets or contaminated materials, or from animals to humans through contact with live animals or consumption of contaminated bushmeat.The incubation period ranges from two to 21 days, although some people can acquire infection without developing symptoms. Typically for mpox, fever, muscle aches and sore throat appear first, followed by skin and mucosal rash. Typically, the rash evolves over 2-4 weeks in stages \u2013 macules, papules, vesicles, pustules. Lesions dip in the centre before crusting over. Scabs then fall off. Lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes) is also a typical feature of mpox, present in most cases. \u00a0Children, pregnant people and people with weak immune systems are at risk for complications and death from mpox.Identifying mpox can be difficult as other infections and conditions can look similar. It is important to distinguish mpox from chickenpox, measles, bacterial skin infections, scabies, herpes, syphilis, other sexually transmissible infections, and medication-associated allergies. Someone with mpox may also concurrently have another sexually transmissible infection such as herpes. Alternatively, a child or adult with suspected mpox may also have chickenpox. For these reasons, testing is key for people to get treatment as early as possible and to prevent further spread. Detection of viral DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the preferred laboratory test for mpox. The best diagnostic specimens are taken directly from the rash \u2013 skin, fluid or crusts \u2013 collected by vigorous swabbing. In the absence of skin lesions, testing can be done on oropharyngeal, anal or rectal swabs. However, while a positive result of oropharyngeal, anal or rectal sample is indicative of mpox, a negative result is not enough to exclude MPXV infection. Testing of blood is not recommended. Antibody detection methods may be used for retrospective case classification, but not diagnosis. It needs to be restricted to reference laboratories and it may not be useful as often it does not distinguish between different orthopoxviruses. Treatment is based on taking care of the rash, managing pain, and preventing complications. In addition, specific antiviral medications such as tecovirimat can also be used in the treatment of mpox, particularly for severe cases or individuals at higher risk of complications. In the context of the global outbreak of mpox which began in 2022 (caused mostly by Clade IIb virus), the presentation of mpox varied, with some cases showing a rash appearing before or simultaneously with other symptoms, and the initial lesions were often localized on genitals and mucosae such as the mouth. For the first time the spread of MPXV has been driven and sustained by sexual contact among men who have sex with men who are members of large sexual networks.",
        "Public Health Response": "Emergency coordination:\u00a0The Ministry of Public Health, Hygiene and Prevention prepared a budgeted national mpox preparedness and response plan. Further to this plan, an mpox Emergency Operations Centre and Incident Management Team were inaugurated in February 2023 to implement the following actions: \u00a0Monitoring and detection:\u00a0Strengthening surveillance of mpox throughout the country and particularly in Kinshasa, Kenge and Kamituga.\u00a0Distribution of sample collection and transport kits to reference hospitals and logistical support for collecting, transporting, and examining samples from suspected cases in Kenge, Kinshasa and other affected areas.Capacity building of health care providers and professionals in mpox surveillance, including detection of sexual transmission and other possible modes of transmission.\u00a0Monitoring of contacts of clinical and laboratory-confirmed cases for a period of 21 days.\u00a0Genetic sequencing of MPXV samples to better understand the circulating viral strain(s).\u00a0\u00a0Communication and awareness:\u00a0Information campaign on the risks of mpox and other sexually transmitted infections to groups potentially at risk, specifically targeting members of sex-clubs in Kenge and elsewhere.\u00a0Identification and engagement of other clubs and populations potentially at risk.\u00a0Establishment of a call center to facilitate alerts reporting and promote communication between health authorities and the communities concerned.\u00a0\u00a0Case management and infection prevention and control:Supply of personal protective equipment to health professionals in Kenge, Kinshasa, Kamituga Maindombe and Tshopo.\u00a0Isolation of confirmed cases in hospital or at home to prevent further transmission.Adapted clinical care, including psychological support, for persons with mpox.\u00a0\u00a0Training and capacity:Training of laboratory workers from Kamituga, Kenge, Kinshasa and any other affected city or province on the collection, conservation, and appropriate delivery of mpox samples.\u00a0Raising awareness among health authorities and health care providers across the country about mpox and its management.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "From 1 January to 12 November 2023, there has been a two-fold increase in the number of suspected mpox cases with 12 569 suspected cases reported, compared to 6216 in 2020, the highest annual number previously reported. Mpox has also been reported in new geographic areas such as Kinshasa, Kwango province and South Kivu. The reasons for this expansion, affecting men, women and children, remain unknown. Although increased awareness of the global mpox epidemic due to clade IIb MPXV has helped improve surveillance in the country, many aspects of the current situation remain to be elucidated.\u00a0Transmission of mpox through sexual contact enables faster spread from one person to another due to direct contact of mucous membranes, possibly leading to a shorter average incubation period. Immunocompromised individuals, either due to uncontrolled HIV or other immunocompromising conditions, are at higher risk for severe mpox complications and mpox-related death. \u00a0While national HIV prevalence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is estimated to be <1%, it is estimated to be 7.1% among men who have sex with men. Overall, an estimated 17% of people living with HIV in the country do not know their status, putting them at risk of developing advanced HIV infection, compromised immunity, and severe mpox disease. The detection of clade I MPXV among visitors to a club of men who have sex with men in Kenge, some of whose members travel to visit other clubs within and outside the country, particularly in central Africa and in Europe, represents a risk for men who have sex with men in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and internationally. In the city of Kinshasa, it is estimated that there are over 50 similar clubs, and some of their members reside outside the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\u00a0It is still unclear what proportion of mpox cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo may be exposed through sexual contact; however, with outbreaks linked to sexual transmission documented in 2023 in three previously unaffected provinces, the potential additional public health impact of this new observation could be significant, particularly in under-resourced urban areas. The rapid evolution of the new outbreak in South Kivu, including among sex workers, is also concerning.Additionally, the first case identified in Kinshasa had traveled to the city by boat on the Congo river. These boats constitute a potentially high exposure environment since people are often in proximity, transporting animals, selling and consuming wild game on board, and often traveling on the boats for weeks while sharing beds and sometimes engaging in sexual activities.\u00a0Moreover, the human-to-human spread potential is amplified in urban settings such as Kinshasa and the implementation of containment measures is more challenging.Response capacities for mpox remain limited in the country. Surveillance and laboratory capacities remain suboptimal: only 9% (1106 / 12 569, as of week 44) of suspected cases this year have been tested by PCR. There are no immunization programmes for populations at risk of mpox in the Democratic Republic of the Congo outside of research projects, and access to the antiviral medication tecovirimat also remains limited to a few clinical research studies in the country. Risk communication and community engagement are therefore of critical importance to address the risk posed by modes of transmission traditionally reported as bushmeat consumption and community outbreaks, as well as for the newly described risk of sexual transmission, particularly among men who have sex with men. According to a recent WHO study, awareness of the risks associated with mpox is low in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\u00a0Additionally, anyone suffering from disfiguring skin conditions, including due to mpox, may face stigma, and the lack of health messages to date for men who have sex with men in the country exposes this population to a particular risk.\u00a0In summary, the reasons for concern about further spread of mpox in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are as follows: The Democratic Republic of the Congo is experiencing a significant increase in the number of suspected cases reported in 2023; \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Geographic expansion of the presence of mpox is underway in the newly affected southern and eastern provinces of the country; Epidemiological and scientific knowledge about mpox remains limited and modes of transmission in the country are poorly understood;In 2023, confirmed cases of mpox have been reported in the large urban area of \u200b\u200bKinshasa and several other previously unaffected areas for the first time;Sexual transmission of mpox due to clade I MPXV is being documented for the first time and chains of transmission may have been missed;Key populations experience a higher prevalence of HIV infection than the general population;Awareness of mpox and the associated risks are insufficient in the general and key populations;National response capacities face challenges, including limited epidemiological information on exposure and infection risk factors, limited public awareness of mpox and prevention measures, and numerous competing priorities;Collaboration and coordination among partners are needed to sustain essential research and support a robust response at national as well as provincial and local levels.\u00a0The risk of mpox further spreading to neighbouring countries and worldwide appears to be significant. In addition to the features outlined above, arguments supporting the assessment of a high risk of international spread of mpox include the following:\u00a0These first reported outbreaks of mpox due to clade I MPXV linked to sexual contact include a history of international travel within and across WHO regions;The introduction of clade I MPXV in different and possibly intersecting sexual networks could facilitate and amplify the spread of this historically more virulent clade of the virus;A concurrent outbreak of mpox is occurring in the neighbouring Republic of Congo along the Congo River ecosystem, whose links, if any, with cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo remain unknown.These factors pose an additional risk of mpox outbreaks with potentially more severe consequences than the one which has been affecting the world since 2022.",
        "WHO Advice": "All countries, including their health authorities and clinicians/healthcare workers, should take note that the global mpox outbreak is ongoing; and, furthermore, the occurrence of sexual transmission of the clade I virus has been confirmed. Infection with clade I MPXV may lead to an increased risk of severe illness.\u00a0It is therefore strongly advised that countries continue to follow the Standing Recommendations of the Director-General of the WHO issued in August 2023, particularly concerning the epidemiological surveillance of mpox, strengthening of laboratory diagnostic capacities and genomic sequencing of viruses, community engagement and risk communication, making vaccines available, optimal case management, strengthening research to better understand modes of transmission in different contexts, and sustained support for the development of rapid diagnostic methods and treatments tailored to the needs of patients.\u00a0In all settings, it is essential to emphasize the importance of case investigation with sensitivity and absence of stigma and in-depth understanding of human-to-human transmission of mpox in communities, while strengthening the One Health approach in areas where the monkeypox virus circulates in possible mammalian hosts or reservoirs.\u00a0It is essential to deepen knowledge in different contexts about the links between mpox and HIV infection, their respective and common risk factors, to provide a population specific health service, and to integrate surveillance and case management within a strengthened and agile health service which meets patient needs.\u00a0Actions in the communityCommunication on the risks of sexual transmission of mpox must be strengthened, especially among the people most at risk and individuals and households affected by this disease. Advocacy must be done at all levels to support, inform and engage community leaders in implementing the necessary measures to inform and engage their communities about mpox and how to stop its spread.\u00a0Risk communication and community engagement activities will be vital in motivating affected communities to become aware of the risks and locally relevant protective behaviours. Socio-behavioural data should be collected, and a situation analysis should be carried out to better understand transmission and risk factors. This information can then be used to improve decision-making, to ensure response efforts are aligned with community needs, priorities and capacities, and to inform the development of risk communications plans and evidence-based community engagement. Key audiences should be identified, including health professionals, men who have sex with men, people working at or attending venues and events where sexual activity takes place, sex workers, and people at risk of more serious illness (including those whose HIV is not treated or adequately controlled). Partnerships should be established with trusted networks working with these communities to facilitate community engagement. Two-way feedback systems should be established or activated. Particular attention should be paid to measures to understand, prevent and combat stigma and discrimination \u2013 these are never acceptable and can undermine the response to the epidemic and have a serious impact on health outcomes.\u00a0Concerning the health facility, points of entry and control Infection prevention and control measures in community venues and health centers are necessary to prevent and respond to outbreaks of mpox. It is important to train staff on the risks linked to contamination, to provide protective equipment, hand washing and hygiene devices in hospitals and at entry/control points; and ensuring appropriate patient isolation is in place. Health care professionals caring for patients with suspected or confirmed mpox infection should take \u201cstandard,\u201d \u201ccontact,\u201d and \u201cdroplet\u201d precautions. While protecting themselves with recommended measures, healthcare workers should also ensure that stigmatization of patients with mpox is avoided, and that psychological support is provided to patients and their families.\u00a0WHO advises against any travel or trade restrictions for the current outbreak.\u00a0When collecting clinical and laboratory specimens Specimens collected from persons and animals suspected of being infected with MPXV should be handled by trained personnel working in equipped laboratories. Confirmation of monkeypox virus depends on the type and quality of the sample, and the type of laboratory test. Thus, specimens must be packaged and shipped in accordance with national and international requirements. RT-PCR is the preferred laboratory test, given its accuracy and sensitivity. For this, the optimal diagnostic samples for MPXV should be taken from skin or mucosal lesions - fluid from vesicles and pustules, and dry scabs. PCR blood tests are generally inconclusive due to the short duration of viremia compared to the time of sample collection after the onset of symptoms; they should not be systematically collected from patients. Because orthopoxviruses are serologically cross-reactive, antigen and antibody detection methods are not sufficiently specific for MPXV and do not constitute a formal confirmatory diagnosis. It is therefore essential that laboratories support health authorities in providing specimen collection kits for skin or mucosal lesions.\u00a0Preventive measures\u00a0\u00a0Anyone with a clinical or laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of mpox should follow the instructions of health authorities according to the local context, including isolation during the infectious period whenever feasible. Contacts of a confirmed case should be monitored or should self-monitor for any sign or symptom, practice hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette, avoid contact with immunocompromised individuals, children, or pregnant women, and avoid sexual contact and non-essential travel for a period of 21 days from the last contact with a person with mpox.Vaccines and antiviral treatmentsVaccines for the prevention of mpox are composed of vaccinia virus and were first developed as safer vaccines for the purpose of smallpox preparedness: third-generation vaccines causing fewer side effects than the vaccines used during smallpox eradication are available. These include MVA-BN, first approved for the prevention of mpox in 2019 and the LC16-KMB vaccine approved for mpox in 2022. These vaccines offer 66-90% protection against mpox due to the antigenic similarity of the viruses that cause smallpox and mpox. A few countries maintain stocks of vaccines against smallpox and mpox, especially since the start of the global outbreak in 2022. Vaccination against mpox is recommended for persons at risk of contracting the disease, including children, and persons who have been in close contact with someone who has mpox.\u00a0Antivirals are also being developed and a clinical trial of the antiviral agent tecovirimat is ongoing in the the Democratic Republic of the Congo in two district hospitals in the provinces of Maniema & Sankuru.\u00a0 In order to access tecovirimat in the country, a request can be made to national health authorities.",

        "Date Reported": "18 October 2023",
        "Location": "Guinea",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 5 September 2023, the Ministry of Health notified WHO of a diphtheria outbreak in Guinea. From 4 July to 13 October 2023, a total of 538 cases of diphtheria, were reported in the Kankan region, in the east-central part of Guinea. Of the total cases reported, 520 are suspected and 18 confirmed with 58 deaths including 13 among confirmed cases (case fatality rate (CFR) among all cases, 11%). The 1-4 years age group accounted for the largest proportion of reported cases.\nDiphtheria is a highly contagious vaccine-preventable disease caused mainly by the bacteria Corynebacterium diphtheriae which can be fatal in 5-10% of cases, with a higher mortality rate in young children. However, in settings with poor access to diphtheria antitoxin, the CFR can be as high as 40%.\nDiphtheria remains a significant health problem in countries with poor routine vaccination coverage. According to WHO/UNICEF estimates of national immunization coverage (WUENIC), the immunization coverage with the diphtheria tetanus toxoid and pertussis (DTP3) containing vaccine was reported to be 47% for 2022 in Guinea and has remained below 50% since 2014. This is insufficient for achieving the coverage of 80\u201385% required to maintain community protection. WHO assesses the risk of diphtheria to be high in Guinea, considering the chronically low vaccination coverage.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 5 September 2023, the Ministry of Health notified WHO of the current diphtheria outbreak in Guinea. On 4 July 2023, two children aged 2 and 4 years, attended the otolaryngology department of the Siguiri prefectural hospital in the Kankan region of Guinea, for similar symptoms (dyspnea, dysphasia, fever, cough). They were hospitalized for tonsillitis and respiratory infection and received antibiotic treatment before being referred to the Kankan regional hospital for additional care.Since 4 July and as of 13 October 2023, 538 cases have been reported, including 18 confirmed cases. In total, 58 deaths including 13 among confirmed cases were registered (case fatality rate (CFR) among all cases, 11%)., and 461 contacts are being followed up. Of the cases reported, 62% are female. The 1-4 years age group, with 445 cases, accounted for the largest proportion of reported cases, 82%, followed by the 5-9 years age group, with 5% and 5% for the 10 years and above age group. Children under the age of 12 months make up 7% of reported cases. None of the 538 cases were vaccinated.Kankan Region is divided into five prefectures and only the K\u00e9rouan\u00e9 prefecture has not reported any cases to date.The prefecture of Siguiri is the most affected, with 510 cases (95%). Of the 363 patients admitted to the treatment centers in Siguiri, 37 (10%) have died.Other prefectures reporting cases are Mandiana (13 cases), Kankan (13 cases) and Kouroussa (two cases).\u00a0 Of the 15 patients admitted in the treatment center in Kankan, 12 (80%) have died.The treatment centers in the country do not have the capacity in terms of human resources and material for adequate case management. Suspected and confirmed cases were treated with Amoxicillin and Azithromycin as first line therapy. Antibiotic prophylaxis (Amoxicillin, Azithromycin) was administered to the direct contacts.Figure 1: Distribution of diphtheria cases in Kankan region, Guinea, as of 13 October 2023\u00a0Figure 2: Suspected diphtheria cases by epidemiological week in Guinea, as of 13 October 2023",
        "Epidemiology": "Diphtheria is a highly contagious vaccine-preventable disease caused mainly by Corynebacterium diphtheria but also by Corynebacterium ulcerans. It spreads between people mainly by direct contact or through the air via respiratory droplets. The disease can affect all age groups; however, unimmunized children are most at risk. Symptoms often come on gradually, beginning with a sore throat and fever. In severe cases, the bacteria produce a poison (toxin) that causes a thick grey or white patch at the back of throat. This can block the airways, making it hard to breathe or swallow, and also creates a barking cough. The neck may swell in part due to enlarged lymph nodes.  Treatment involves administering diphtheria antitoxin (DAT) as well as antibiotics. Vaccination against diphtheria has been effective in reducing the mortality and morbidity from diphtheria dramatically. Diphtheria is fatal in 5-10% of cases, with a higher mortality rate in young children. However, in settings with poor access to DAT, the CFR can be as high as 40%.",
        "Public Health Response": "Guinea has strengthened epidemiological surveillance for early detection and case management.Daily coordination and monitoring meetings on the response activities are underway at the Regional level, led by the regional health inspector and with the support of WHO, MSF- Belgium and other partners in the region. Notification of all suspected cases of diphtheria, investigation initiation, and monitoring of contacts as soon as possible has been enhanced.Contact tracing, identification of an isolation zone at the Balato health post in the prefecture of Kouroussa and briefing of the healthcare workers on the case definition and prevention measures are ongoing. Case management activities such as antibiotic therapy (Amoxicillin, Azithromycin), treatment of suspected cases, antibiotic prophylaxis (Amoxicillin, Azithromycin) for the direct contacts and free case management at treatment centers with support from MSF are provided. Risk communication and community engagement efforts, such as raising awareness of cases in the community and identifying and briefing a communicator to raise awareness among parents of patients is ongoing.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Diphtheria is a vaccine-preventable disease caused by exotoxin-producing Corynebacterium diphtheriae, transmitted from person to person through close physical and respiratory contact. It can cause infection of the nasopharynx, which may lead to breathing difficulties and death. Diphtheria is fatal in 5 - 10% of cases, with a higher mortality rate in young children. Treatment involves administering diphtheria antitoxin as well as antibiotics. Vaccination against diphtheria has reduced the mortality and morbidity of diphtheria dramatically.The DAT supply is currently very constrained and insufficient to respond to current demands, as there is only a limited number of manufacturers and large outbreaks are being reported in different regions of the world.The risk of diphtheria in Guinea is considered high due to the low DTP3 vaccination coverage in the affected region (36% according to the survey coverage in households, 2023) and 47% national DTP3 vaccination coverage between 2014-2022 (per WHO/UNICEF estimates), and the risk at the regional level is moderate and low at the global level. The outbreak is also characterized by high case fatality among confirmed cases. Other factors include: the over population of the Siguiri health district, which is the epicenter of this outbreak, the weakened healthcare system and several concurrent epidemics in the area. The overpopulation of the Siguiri health prefecture, the epicenter of this epidemic, the insufficient poorly qualified health personnel, and the limited material resources of the health system weakens the response to this outbreak. In addition, the country is facing several concurrent epidemics in the area, such as pertussis, poliomyelitis, and rabies. Adding this to a context of extreme vulnerability due to mining activities, which induce significant population movement, reduce air quality, and increase the risk of natural disasters such as floods and landslides, impacting people\u2019s health.This emphasizes the urgent need to strengthen diphtheria vaccination coverage nationwide, especially in the epicenter and strengthen case management at hospital facilities dealing with diphtheria cases.",
        "WHO Advice": "The control of diphtheria is based on primary disease prevention by ensuring high population immunity through vaccination and secondary prevention of spread by the rapid investigation of close contacts to ensure prompt treatment of those infected.Epidemiological surveillance ensuring early detection of diphtheria outbreaks should be in place in all countries, and all countries should have access to laboratory facilities for reliable identification of toxigenic C. diphtheriae. Adequate quantities of diphtheria antitoxin should be available nationally or regionally for the medical management of cases.Vaccination is vital to preventing cases and outbreaks, and adequate clinical management involves administering diphtheria anti-toxin to neutralize the toxin and antibiotics reducing complications and mortality.WHO recommends early reporting and case management of suspected diphtheria cases to initiate the timely treatment of cases and follow-up of contacts and ensure the supply of diphtheria antitoxin.WHO advises implementing the following Infection Prevention & Control (IPC) measures in health care settings:At screening/triage, immediately place patients with symptoms of Upper Respiratory Tract Infection (URTI) in a separate area until examined, and, if a probable case, cohorted with patients with the same diagnosis. Keep the isolation area segregated from other patient-care areas.In addition to using standard precautions, patients with known or suspected respiratory diphtheria are placed under droplet precautions. Patients with known or suspected cutaneous diphtheria should be placed under contact precautions. Maintain one meter between patients. Keep patient care areas well- ventilated. Avoid patient movement or transport out of the isolation area. If movement is necessary out of the isolation area, have the patient use a medical mask and cover any wounds/lesions on the patient\u2019s body.Case management should be carried out following the WHO guidelines. In addition, high-risk populations such as young children under five years of age, school children, the elderly, close contact with diphtheria cases, and healthcare workers should be vaccinated on a priority basis. A coordinated response and community engagement can support further transmission and control of the ongoing outbreak. Prophylactic antibiotics (penicillin or erythromycin, dependent on the isolate antibiotic sensitivity) are indicated for close contacts for seven days. If the culture is positive for toxigenic Corynebacterium spp.., the contact should be treated as a case with an antibiotic course for two weeks (DAT is not needed for asymptomatic cases or cases without a pseudo membrane).Although travelers do not have a particular risk of diphtheria infection, it is recommended that national authorities remind travelers going to areas with diphtheria outbreaks to be appropriately vaccinated in accordance with the national vaccination scheme established in each country before travel. A booster dose is recommended if more than five years have passed since their last dose.WHO does not recommend that any general travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea based on the information available for this event.",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 15 August 2023, a dengue outbreak was declared by the Ministry of Public Health and Prevention in Chad. As of 1 October, there have been 1 342 suspected cases, including 41 confirmed cases reported across eight health districts in four provinces. Among the confirmed cases, one death was reported. Ab\u00e9ch\u00e9 health district in Ouadda\u00ef province, is the current epicentre of the outbreak.\nThe Ministry of Public Health and Prevention has initiated a number of key response activities by implementing, in collaboration with WHO and partners, the national contingency plan for dengue preparedness and response.\nDengue is a viral infection transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes. Many dengue infections produce only mild flu-like illness and over 80% of cases are asymptomatic. There is no specific treatment for dengue; however, timely detection of cases and appropriate case management are key elements of care to prevent severity and fatality of dengue.\nThis is the first dengue outbreak reported in Chad, and the country has limited surveillance, clinical and laboratory capabilities.\nGiven the favorable environmental conditions for mosquito spread, an ongoing humanitarian crisis due to a massive influx of refugees and returnees from Sudan and limited response capacities, WHO assesses the risk posed by this outbreak as high at the national level.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 15 August 2023, the Ministry of Public Health and Prevention of the Republic of Chad officially declared an outbreak of dengue in Ab\u00e9ch\u00e9 health district, Ouadda\u00ef province, in the east of the country, representing the first dengue outbreak ever reported in Chad.The declaration was made after the confirmation of dengue infection in eight out of 12 blood samples tested using real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) at the national Biosafety and Epidemics Laboratory (LaBiEp) in N'Djamena. Subsequently, the samples were sent to the Institut Pasteur in Cameroon for confirmation, which was completed on 22 August by PCR and ELISA, confirming the presence of dengue.As of 1 October, there have been 1 342 suspected cases, including 41 confirmed cases reported across eight health districts in four provinces. Among the confirmed cases, one death was reported (Case Fatality Ratio (CFR) among confirmed cases 2.4%).The dengue serotype responsible for this outbreak remains unknown.Eight districts in four provinces (NDjamena, Ouadda\u00ef, Sila, and Wadi Fira) have reported confirmed dengue cases. Notably, Ouadda\u00ef, the epicentre of the outbreak, has reported the highest number of confirmed cases, accounting for 31 out of the total 41 confirmed cases (76% of confirmed cases). The age group most affected by this outbreak are those between 15 to 34 years old, representing 27% of the reported confirmed cases.",
        "Epidemiology": "Dengue is a viral infection transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes and is found in tropical and sub-tropical climates worldwide, mostly in urban and semi-urban areas. The primary vectors that transmit the disease are Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and, to a lesser extent, Aedes albopictus.Dengue virus (DENV) has four serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4). Infection with one serotype provides long-term immunity to the homologous serotype but not to the other serotypes; sequential infections with a different serotype put people at greater risk for severe dengue. Many DENV infections produce only mild flu-like illness and over 80% of cases are asymptomatic.There is no specific treatment for dengue; however, the timely detection of cases, identifying any warning signs of severe dengue infection, and appropriate case management are key elements of care to lower the CFR during an outbreak to less than 1%.Although Chad has previously experienced outbreaks of arboviruses such as chikungunya and yellow fever, this is the first dengue outbreak ever reported in the country. Chad, including the Ouadda\u00ef province, experienced a chikungunya outbreak in 2020, with a total of 34 052 cases recorded and one associated death.",
        "Public Health Response": "The Ministry of Public Health and Prevention has initiated a number of key response activities, with the support of WHO and other partners, including:Mobilizing resources for the implementation of the national contingency plan for dengue preparedness and response, developed with WHO assistance.Strengthening surveillance and coordinating the response, including active case finding in healthcare facilities and the community and in-depth epidemiological investigations including regularly updating the case line list.Increasing early case detection capacity by disseminating community alert definition of cases and procuring rapid diagnostic tests (Bioline\u00a0 Dengue Duo (DENGUE NS1 Ag + IgG/IgM)) for health facilities.Ensuring effective logistics and operational support, including the transportation of samples for confirmation.Developing standard operating procedures (SOPs) for clinical management of suspected and confirmed dengue cases, including severe dengue and ensuring inventory of existing case management kits and address gaps.Strengthening cross-border collaboration and implementing prevention and vector control measures in border areas.Strengthening entomological surveillance, including aquatic and adult stages of the vectors, and characterizing vector bionomics.Implementing effective vector control measures as part of integrated vector management.Strengthening community mobilization and commitment to disseminate key information on transmission and control to the population.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "This is the first dengue outbreak reported in Chad, and the country lacks the necessary public health preparedness and response capacities.Community cases are likely underreported because dengue is unknown to the general public and clinicians are not yet sensitised to its presentation, which is sometimes confused with those of other common febrile infections, making early diagnosis challenging, particularly in settings with lack of laboratory facilities for testing.There is a high risk of spread due to the presence of mosquitoes in large, densely populated cities in eastern Chad near the Sudan border, with a tropical climate, and poor sanitation conditions suitable for mosquito development.The province of Ouadda\u00ef, which borders Sudan, is the epicentre of the outbreak and is also the province most affected by the ongoing humanitarian crisis due to a massive influx of refugees and returnees from Sudan. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the number of refugees in the Ouadda\u00ef province is currently more than 400 000.The movement of returning Sudanese refugees and Chadian nationals has the potential to spread the outbreak to new provinces and across the border.Based on the information available for this event, WHO assesses the risk posed by this outbreak as high at the national level, moderate at regional level, and low at global level.",
        "WHO Advice": "The proximity of mosquito breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for dengue virus infection. The prevention and control of dengue depend on effective vector control. Vector control activities should focus on all areas where there is a risk of human-vector contact (place of residence, workplaces, schools, and hospitals). WHO promotes a strategic approach known as Integrated Vector Management (IVM) to control Aedes species, the vector of dengue. IVM should be enhanced to remove potential breeding sites, reduce vector populations, and minimize individual exposure. This should involve vector control strategies for larvae and adults (i.e. environmental management and source reduction), especially of water storage practices, and include covering, draining and cleaning household water storage containers on a weekly basis, applying larvicide in non-potable waters using WHO-prequalified larvicides at correct dosages, distribution of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) for fever/dengue inpatients to contain spread of virus from health facilities, as well as strategies for protecting people and households. Indoor space spraying (fogging) is another approach for rapid containment of dengue-infected mosquitoes but may be challenging to deliver in densely populated areas of camps.Personal protective measures during outdoor activities include topical application of repellents to exposed skin or treatment of clothing, and wearing long-sleeved shirts and pants. Indoor protection can include household insecticide aerosol products, or mosquito coils. Window and door screens can reduce the probability of mosquitoes entering the house. Insecticide-treated nets offer good protection against mosquito bites while sleeping during the day. Since Aedes mosquitoes (the primary vector for transmission) are active at dawn and dusk, personal protective measures are recommended, particularly at these times of day, both in residential areas and also at places of work and schools for children.Entomological surveillance should be undertaken to assess the breeding potential of Aedes mosquitoes in containers and monitor insecticide resistance to help select the most effective insecticide-based interventions. There is no specific treatment for dengue infection, but early detection and access to appropriate healthcare for case management can reduce mortality. Case surveillance should continue to be enhanced in all affected areas and nationwide. Where feasible, resources should be allocated to strengthen a sample referral mechanism for the confirmation and sub-typing of the dengue virus.Communities play a major role in the success and sustainability of vector control activities. While coordination among many stakeholders is required, vector control is critically dependent on ensuring that communities are aware of the risk of infection and know which measures to take to protect themselves. Community engagement and mobilization involve working with local residents to improve vector control and build resilience against future disease outbreaks. Where appropriate participatory community-based approaches are in place, communities are supported to take responsibility for and implement vector control. Participatory community-based approaches aim to ensure that healthy behaviours become part of the social fabric and that communities take ownership of vector control at both inside and outside households.Based on the information available for this event, WHO does not recommend travel or trade restrictions be applied to Chad.",

        "Date Reported": "3 October 2023",
        "Location": "India",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "From the 12 to 15 September 2023, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, reported six laboratory-confirmed Nipah virus cases, including two deaths, in Kozhikode district, Kerala. Aside from the first case, whose source of infection is unknown, the other cases were family and hospital contacts of the first case. As of 27 September 2023,1288 contacts of the confirmed cases were traced, including high-risk contacts and healthcare workers, who are under quarantine and monitoring for 21 days. Since 12 September, 387 samples have been tested, of which six cases were positive for Nipah virus infection, and all remaining samples tested negative. Since 15 September, no new cases have been detected. This is the sixth outbreak of Nipah virus in India since 2001.\nNipah virus infection, a zoonotic illness, is spread to humans through contact with infected animals such as bats and pigs. Additionally, direct contact with an infected individual can also lead to transmission, although this route is less common. Those affected by Nipah virus infection may experience severe symptoms, including acute respiratory infection and fatal encephalitis. The only way to reduce or prevent infection in people is by raising awareness about the risk factors and preventive measures to protect themselves. Case management should focus on providing patients with supportive care measures and intensive support for severe respiratory and neurologic complications.\nState and national authorities activated a multisectoral coordination and response mechanism to contain the spread of the outbreak including enhanced surveillance and contact tracing, laboratory testing of suspected cases and high-risk contacts, hospital preparedness for case management, infection prevention and control (IPC), risk communication and community engagement.",
        "Description of the Situation": "Between 12 and 15 September 2023, a total of six laboratory-confirmed cases of Nipah virus infection including two deaths were reported by the State Government of Kerala. All confirmed cases were males within the age range of 9 to 45 years old and were reported within the Kozhikode district of Kerala.The first case whose source of infection is unknown, had pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and was admitted at a hospital in late August 2023. He died a few days after admission.\u00a0 The other five confirmed cases were close contacts of the first case including two family members and contacts at the hospital where the first case was treated and died. The second death occurred in an individual who accompanied another patient to the hospital where the first case was being treated. He died after presenting with symptoms of pneumonia.As of 27 September 2023, 1288 contacts of the confirmed cases have been traced, including high-risk contacts and healthcare workers who treated the confirmed cases and processed their samples. All identified contacts are under quarantine for a period of 21 days. As of 27 September 2023, the four cases remain clinically stable.The Government\u2019s response measures included declaring containment zones in nine villages in the Kozhikode district with movement restrictions, social distancing, and mandatory mask-wearing in public spaces. The government restricted major public events in Kozhikode district until 1 October 2023. Alerts were issued to neighbouring districts and states for enhanced surveillance.According to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, the virus found in Kerala has been identified as the Indian Genotype or I-Genotype and is similar to the Nipah virus strain found in Bangladesh.",
        "Epidemiology": "Nipah virus infection is an emerging bat-borne zoonotic disease transmitted to humans through infected animals (such as bats and pigs) or food contaminated with saliva, urine, and excreta of infected animals. It can also be transmitted directly from person to person through close contact with an infected person (although this represents a less common transmission route).Nipah virus infection in humans causes a range of clinical presentations including acute respiratory infection and fatal encephalitis. \u00a0The case-fatality rates in outbreaks across Bangladesh, India, Malaysia, and Singapore typically range from 40% to 100%. As of now, there are no available effective therapies or vaccines for this disease.The current outbreak is the third Nipah virus outbreak in Kozhikode district, Kerala, the fourth outbreak in Kerala state since 2018 and the sixth outbreak in India. Similar to the previous outbreak in 2018 in Kerala, this outbreak started with the first case and subsequent clustering of cases in family contacts and likely nosocomial transmission in hospitals. In the WHO South-East Asia Region, only Bangladesh and India have reported Nipah virus outbreaks.",
        "Public Health Response": "The following public health response measures were implemented by the Department of Health and Family Welfare, State Government of Kerala, with support from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, and its institutions; Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, and National Institute of Epidemiology, Chennai. Coordination: Multiple central multi-disciplinary teams were mobilized by the Department of Health & Family Welfare, Department of Health Research as well as Department of Animal Husbandry to support the State and District administration in containment and mitigation measures. A total of 19 core committees were created and tasked with various response measures including surveillance, sample testing, contact tracing, patient transportation, case management, logistics and supplies, training and capacity building, risk communication and community engagement, psychosocial support and animal husbandry. A control room with a call center was activated in the district to coordinate the response activities.Surveillance and contact tracing: As part of community-based surveillance activities, active house-to-house surveillance was carried out by the district health authorities in the containment zones declared. A total of 53,708 houses have been surveyed as of 27 September 2023. As of 27 September, 1288 contacts including high-risk contacts were identified and quarantine with follow up exercise ongoing. All high-risk contacts were tested. Containment zones were declared in nine villages in Kozhikode district with movement restrictions, social distancing and mandatory mask-wearing in public spaces. The government restricted major public events in Kozhikode district until 1 October 2023. Alerts have been issued to neighbouring districts and states for enhanced surveillance.Laboratory testing: Laboratory testing of suspected cases as well as environmental and animal samples is being conducted at the Regional Viral Research and Diagnostic Laboratory network lab at the Government Medical College (GMC), Kozhikode; Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) Mobile BSL-3 lab; Field unit of NIV at Alappuzha as well as NIV, Pune. As of 27 September 2023, no environmental/animal samples (including bats) have tested positive for Nipah virus.Health facility preparedness: Emergency departments have been equipped to handle any suspected cases and respond to emergencies. Isolation rooms and intensive care units (ICU) are being kept ready to treat suspected cases, where required. The State has earmarked isolation rooms, ICU beds, and ventilators to mount surge capacity when needed. Suspected and confirmed cases are being managed at designated health facilities. For patient transport, dedicated ambulances have been mobilized.Infection prevention and control: The State Government has initiated training of healthcare workers on infection prevention and control (IPC). Adequate stocks of Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs) have been made available to health care workers and IPC practices are being strictly adhered to and audited.Logistic management: Adequate stocks of PPEs, drugs and other requisite logistics are being provided by the State Government.Dead body management: Arrangement has also been made for the transfer and management of dead bodies by the State Government in compliance with the standard protocol and IPC precautions.Risk communication and community engagement: Information education and communication activities through different modalities (including regular press releases) have been initiated. Further, audio spots and video bytes by expert doctors are being issued. Infodemic management strategies are currently being implemented with strict action taken against fake news. A call center to provide psychosocial care has also been established by the State Government. Animal Sector: Samples of bats, animal droppings, and half-eaten fruits were collected on 15 September from the village where the first case lived, in a 300-acre (121-hectare) forest which is home to several bat species. All samples tested negative for Nipah virus.Public health response measures were implemented in accordance with the guidelines developed by the State Government and Government of India with support from WHO and partners during the 2018 Nipah virus outbreak in Kerala state.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "This is the sixth outbreak in India since 2001 when the first outbreak was reported in Siliguri town, West Bengal (66 cases, CFR: 68%). Subsequently, five outbreaks have been reported- Nadia district, West Bengal (5 cases; CFR: 100%), Kozhikode and Malappuram, Kerala in 2018 (23 cases including confirmed and probable; CFR: 91%), Ernakulum, Kerala in 2019 (a single case who survived) and Kozhikode, Kerala in 2021 (one case, CFR: 100%).The following factors may contribute to the risk associated with this outbreak:The exposure of the first case in this outbreak remains unknown;The presence of a bat population which has been reported to harbor Nipah virus and therefore acts as a potential source of infection;High reported case fatality rate (33.3%) and high number of contacts; andThe absence of Nipah virus-specific therapeutics and vaccines.At the same time, the current outbreak is not entirely unexpected and is the third outbreak in Kozhikode district and fourth in the state of Kerala. Current cases are clustered and epidemiologically linked to the first case, and cases are localized to Kozhikode district. Public health teams and health care workers in Kozhikode have prior experience in managing outbreaks of Nipah virus infection. The State Government has rapidly established response measures to contain the spread of the outbreak and through enhanced surveillance and contact tracing measures, 1288 contacts have been identified and are under monitoring. High-risk contacts are being tested.",
        "WHO Advice": "In the absence of a vaccine or licensed treatment available for Nipah virus, the only way to reduce or prevent infection in people is by raising awareness of the risk factors and educating people about the measures they can take to reduce exposure to Nipah virus infection. Case management should focus on the delivery of supportive care measures to patients. Intensive supportive care is recommended to treat severe respiratory and neurologic complications. Public health educational messages should focus on:Reducing the risk of bat-to-human transmissionFreshly collected date palm juice should be boiled, and fruits should be thoroughly washed and peeled before consumption. Fruits with signs of bat bites should be discarded. Areas where bats are known to roost should be avoided. The risk of international transmission via fruit or fruit products (such as raw date palm juice) contaminated with urine or saliva from infected fruit bats can be prevented by washing them thoroughly and peeling them before consumption.Reducing the risk of animal-to-human transmissionNatural infection in domestic animals has been described in farming pigs, horses, and domestic and feral cats. Gloves and other protective clothing should be worn while handling sick animals or their tissues and during slaughtering and culling procedures. As much as possible, people should avoid being in contact with infected pigs. In endemic areas, when establishing new pig farms, consideration should be given to the presence of fruit bats in the area and in general, pig feed and pig sheds should be protected against bats when feasible. Samples taken from animals with suspected Nipah virus infection should be handled by trained staff working in suitably equipped laboratories.Reducing the risk of human-to-human transmissionClose unprotected physical contact with Nipah virus infected people should be avoided. Regular hand washing should be carried out after caring for or visiting sick people. Health care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed infection, or those handling their specimens, including trained staff working in suitably equipped laboratories, should always implement infection prevention and control standard precautions as well as contact and droplet precautions when providing care or working in the rooms of patients with suspected or confirmed Nipah virus and when handling/managing linens or waste from patients with Nipah virus. Case management should focus on the delivery of supportive care measures to patients. Intensive supportive care is recommended to treat severe respiratory and neurologic complications.\u00a0 Safe burial practices are required for all confirmed and suspected Nipah virus infected cases.Infection prevention and controlIn health care settings, patients who are suspected of Nipah virus should be isolated in well-ventilated single rooms with dedicated patient equipment and toileting. Patients with suspected Nipah virus should not be placed in cohort rooms. Health care workers interacting with patients with Nipah virus should use contact and droplet precautions when caring for patients with Nipah virus. Contact, droplet, and airborne precautions should be used, including placement of a patient in an airborne isolation room when aerosol-generating medical procedures are performed. If airborne isolation rooms are not available, a well-ventilated single room with windows open if using natural ventilation with doors to corridors closed. Cleaning and disinfection of all surfaces in patient rooms housing suspected or confirmed patients with Nipah virus should occur at least once daily. After cleaning with soap and water, a 0.5% sodium hypochlorite solution disinfectant should be applied to surfaces, remaining untouched for 5 minutes contact time. Immediate cleaning and disinfection, as well as high touch surface cleaning, should be performed whenever a spill of blood or body fluid occurs.\u00a0 Health facilities should be equipped with enhanced water, sanitation and hygiene services to meet the needs of staff, patients and caregivers. Safe waste management practices should be adhered to by the health care facilities.WHO infection prevention and control advice when caring for patients with Nipah virus infection is currently under review and is pending update.WHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions on India based on the current information available on this event.",

        "Outbreak name": "Western equine encephalitis",
        "Date Reported": "28 December 2023",
        "Location": "Argentina",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 20 December, the International Health Regulations National Focal Point (IHR NFP) of Argentina notified the World Health Organization (WHO) of a human case of Western Equine Encephalitis (WEE) infection. This is the first confirmed human case reported after more than two decades, since the last reported human cases in Argentina occurred in 1982/1983 and 1996.\nWEE is a rare mosquito-borne viral disease that affects equines and humans. Most human cases are associated with epidemics in birds or horses. The virus has the potential to spread to other areas through the migration of infected birds or the movement of people and animals carrying the virus. Given that birds act as a reservoir, they can act as amplifying hosts for viral dissemination to other countries. At-risk groups include people who live, work, or participate in outdoor activities in endemic areas or where there are declared active disease outbreaks in animals.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 20 December,\u00a0the IHR NFP of Argentina notified the WHO of a human case of WEE infection. The patient is an adult from the province of Santa Fe. \u00a0This is the first human case of WEE reported after more than two decades, since the last cases reported in humans in Argentina occurred in 1982/1983 (associated with an outbreak in equines) and 1996 (an isolated case based on clinical and serological findings but with no equine cases detected).1The patient developed symptoms including headache, myalgia, dizziness, disorientation, and sudden-onset fever on 19 November 2023. On 24 November 2023, the patient received medical attention and was hospitalized in a health facility in the province, where he required intensive care and mechanical ventilation for 12 days. The patient was discharged on 20 December and is undergoing outpatient monitoring.1\u00a0Regarding the exposure history, according to information from the epidemiological investigation, the patient is a rural worker in an area where equines that tested positive for WEE infection had previously been identified.1Patient samples were collected on 24 November 2023, at a hospital in the province, and, on 4 December 2023, were sent to the Reference Laboratory of the National Institute of Human Viral Diseases \"Dr. Julio I. Maiztegui\" (INEVH per its acronym in Spanish), which is part of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (ANLIS Malbr\u00e1n). The samples tested positive on 19 December 2023 for the detection of specific neutralizing antibodies for the WEE virus. The samples also tested negative for other alphaviruses: Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) virus, Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis (VEE) virus, Una virus, Mayaro virus, and Chikungunya virus.",
        "Epidemiology": "WEE is a rare mosquito-borne disease caused by a virus of the same name, which belongs to the genus\u00a0Alphavirus\u00a0of the\u00a0Togaviridae\u00a0family, to which the EEE and VEE viruses also belong. The main reservoir hosts of EEE and WEE viruses are passerine birds.2\u00a0In humans, the WEE virus can cause disease ranging from subclinical or moderate symptoms to severe forms of aseptic meningitis and encephalitis. The virus has the potential to spread to other areas through the migration of infected birds or even through the movement of people and animals carrying the virus. Given that birds act as a reservoir, they can act as amplifying hosts for viral dissemination to other countries. At-risk groups include people who live, work, or participate in outdoor activities in endemic areas or where there are declared active disease outbreaks in animals. In Argentina, between 25 November and 27 December of 2023, a total of 1182 outbreaks of WEE disease have been identified in equines in 12 provinces of the country: Buenos Aires (n = 717), Santa Fe (n = 149), C\u00f3rdoba (n = 141), Entre R\u00edos (n = 69), Corrientes (n = 41), Chaco (n = 19), La Pampa (n = 18), R\u00edo Negro (n = 11), Formosa (n = 8), Santiago del Estero (n = 6), San Luis (n = 2), and Salta (n = 1).3",
        "Public Health Response": "Following the detection of the WEE virus in equines, the Ministry of Health activated a nationwide epidemiological alert, on 28 November 2023, to provide further information on the disease outbreaks in equines and to strengthen epidemiological surveillance of possible human cases.\u00a0 The epidemiological surveillance includes both passive and active case finding, the latter in areas with active disease outbreaks in animals, according to the case definitions established in the Circular for the epidemiological and laboratory surveillance, prevention and control of Western Equine Encephalitis in Argentina.4Argentina's national Ministry of Health is also working together with the National Food Safety and Quality Service (SENASA per its acronym in Spanish) and the Ministries of Health of the Province of Santa Fe and of other affected provinces, on the implementation of preventive measures, epidemiological surveillance and outbreak control actions.1",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "The primary mode of WEE virus transmission is through the bites of infected mosquitoes, which act as vectors. The principal vector is Culex tarsalis; however, there are multiple vectors that contribute to transmission, including\u00a0Aedes\u00a0melanimon,\u00a0Aedes\u00a0dorsalis,\u00a0and\u00a0Aedes campestris.\u00a0These vectors maintain the circulation of the virus in wild enzootic cycles where birds act as reservoirs of the virus. Humans and equines act as the final reservoirs of the virus, incapable of transmitting the virus to mosquitoes.5 People engaged in outside work or activities are at greater risk because of exposure to mosquitoes. Outbreaks of WEE in humans generally present as isolated cases with moderate symptoms and most infections are asymptomatic. Neurological manifestations include meningitis, encephalitis, or myelitis. Similar to other arboviral encephalitis, the encephalitis caused by WEE is characterized by fever accompanied by altered mental status, seizures, or focal neurological signs including movement disorders.6 There is no specific antiviral treatment and patient management primarily involves supportive care measures.",
        "WHO Advice": "Below is a summary of the main recommendations for laboratory diagnosis in humans, surveillance, and prevention measures.Laboratory diagnosis of WEE in humansThe diagnosis of WEE infection requires confirmation through laboratory techniques since the clinical presentation is not specific. These laboratory methods include virological (direct) diagnostic methods by nucleic acid amplification or potentially cell culture and serological (indirect) methods, aiming to detect antibodies produced against the virus. Generally, samples for diagnosis include serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF should only be collected in cases with neurological symptoms and by clinical indication.\u00a0The diagnostic methods are described in more detail in the\u00a0Laboratory Guidelines for the Detection and Diagnosis of Western Equine Encephalitis Virus Human Infection.7SurveillanceIn at-risk areas with reported active outbreaks in animals, strengthening surveillance is recommended with active human case finding for compatible neurological syndromes without any other defined diagnosis, taking into account the incubation period, geographic area, and environmental conditions.Prevention MeasuresPreventive actions, listed below, must be organized within the framework of One Health, considering the inter-institutional and comprehensive action between animal health, human health, and the environment.Managing the environmentConsidering the ecology and biology of the main vectors of the WEE virus, the main prevention measures recommended are modifying the environment and environmental management to reduce the number of mosquitoes and their contact with equines and humans. These measures include:Filling or draining water collections, ponds, or temporary flooding sites that may serve as sites of female oviposition and breeding sites for mosquito larvae.Elimination of weeds around premises to reduce mosquito resting and shelter sites.Protecting equines by sheltering them in stables with mosquito nets, particularly at times when mosquitoes are most active.Although the main vectors do not have indoor habits, it is advisable to protect homes with mosquito nets on doors and windows; in this way, other arboviruses are also prevented.Vector ControlVector control measures for the WEE virus should be considered within the Integrated Vector Management (IVM) framework. It is important to consider that the decision to carry out vector control activities with insecticides depends on entomological surveillance data and the variables that may increase in the risk of transmission, including insecticide resistance data. Insecticide spraying may be considered as an additional measure, where technically feasible, in areas of transmission where high mosquito populations are detected. The methodology should be established based on the ecology and behavior of local vectors.Vaccination in equinesVaccines are available for equines. It is advisable to seek high vaccination coverage among susceptible equines in areas considered at risk and to carry out annual vaccination boosters.Personal Protective MeasuresUse of clothing that covers the legs and arms, especially in households where someone is ill.Use of repellents containing DEET, IR3535 or Icaridin, which may be applied to exposed skin or clothing, in strict accordance with the instructions on the product label.Use wire mesh/mosquito nets on doors and windows.Use of insecticide-treated or non-insecticide nets for daytime sleepers (e.g. pregnant women, infants, bedridden people, the elderly, and night shift workers).In outbreak situations, outdoor activities should be avoided during the period of greatest mosquito activity (dawn and dusk).",

        "Outbreak name": "Dengue",
        "Date Reported": "21 December 2023",
        "Location": "Global situation",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "Global Overview\u00a0Current situation\u00a0The global incidence of dengue has markedly increased over the past two decades, posing a substantial public health challenge. From 2000 to 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) documented a ten-fold surge in reported cases worldwide increasing from 500 000 to 5.2 million. The year 2019 marked an unprecedented peak, with reported instances spreading across 129 countries.\u00a0\u00a0After a slight decline of cases between the year 2020-2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and lower reporting rate, in 2023, an upsurge in dengue cases have been observed globally, characterized by a significant increase in the number, scale, and simultaneous occurrence of multiple outbreaks, spreading into regions previously unaffected by dengue.\u00a0Dengue transmission is cyclic and large outbreaks every 3-4 years can be expected. During the COVID-19 pandemic we saw moderate transmission of dengue in some regions and low transmission in others leading to an accumulation of people without immunity to certain dengue virus serotypes. However, the data on the circulating dengue serotypes is limited.\u00a0\u00a0Since the beginning of 2023, ongoing transmission, combined with an unexpected spike in dengue cases have resulted in close to a historic high of over five million cases and more than 5000 dengue-related deaths reported in over 80 countries/territories and five WHO regions: Africa, Americas, South-East Asia, Western Pacific and Eastern Mediterranean Regions globally (Figure 1). Close to 80% of these cases, or 4.1 million, have been reported in the Region of the Americas. Dengue is the most widespread arbovirus and causes the highest number of arboviral disease cases in the Region of the Americas, with cyclic epidemics recurring every 3 to 5 years. In addition, clusters of autochthonous dengue have been reported in the WHO European Region. However, these numbers are likely an underestimate of the true burden as most of the primary infections are asymptomatic and dengue reporting is not mandatory in many countries.\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u00a0Several factors are associated with the increasing risk of spread of the dengue epidemic including, the changing distribution of the vectors (chiefly Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus), especially in previously dengue na\u00efve countries; the consequences of El Nino phenomena in 2023 and climate change leading to increasing temperatures and high rainfall, humidity among others; fragile health systems in the midst of COVID-19 pandemic, political and financial instabilities in countries facing complex humanitarian crises and high population movements. These factors also challenge the response to the epidemic and the risk of further spread to other countries. Weakness in the surveillance systems in many affected countries may have led to delayed reporting and response and missed identification of symptoms, contributing to increased severe dengue outcomes.\u00a0WHO has assessed the risk to be high globally considering the increasing risk of transmission and the upsurge of cases and deaths.\u00a0\u00a0Figure 1: Countries/territories/areas reporting autochthonous dengue cases (November 2022- November 2023)\u00a0** Based on most recent available data (the data should be interpreted considering the differences in reporting rates and case definitions between the regions).Regional overview\u00a0WHO Region of Africa:\u00a0Africa is among the top four regions most affected by arboviral diseases, including yellow fever, dengue, chikungunya, O'nyong nyong, Rift Valley fever, and Zika. In 2023, 171 991 dengue cases have been reported in countries in the region and 753 deaths.\u202fEvidence of dengue circulation has been detected in local populations and/or among travelers returning from more than 30 African countries.\u00a0\u00a0Outbreaks have been reported from 15 of the 47 countries including Benin, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Chad, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Mali, Mauritius, Niger, Nigeria, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Principe, Senegal and Togo. The outbreaks in most of these countries began in 2023, except in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, where it was a continuation of an outbreak that started in April 2022. As of 19 December 2023, outbreaks are still ongoing in 11 countries and were declared over in Chad, Guinea, Mauritius, and S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe.\u00a0The most affected country in the region in 2023 is Burkina Faso, experiencing a significant increase in dengue cases compared with the same periods in 2021 and 2022. As of 18 December, the cumulative number of cases reported in the country for 2023 is 146 878 suspected cases, including 68 346 probable cases (positive rapid diagnostic test) and 688 deaths among suspected cases, representing a case fatality rate of 0.5%.\u202f\u202f\u00a0The burden of dengue in Africa is not well understood due to i) similarity of common, non-specific clinical symptoms of the disease with malaria and other tropical febrile illnesses; ii) limited laboratory capacity for timely detection and confirmation of dengue, which is crucial for detecting and reporting cases and preventing its spread; and iii) inadequate surveillance and limited case reporting, especially for dengue.\u00a0Efforts are ongoing to better understand the transmission dynamics of dengue and other arboviruses in the region.\u202f\u202fThe WHO Regional Office for Africa has endorsed the Framework for the integrated control, elimination and eradication of tropical and vector-borne diseases in the African Region 2022-2030. Equally, the Regional Office has also drafted the Framework for implementation of the Global Arbovirus Initiative by targeted Member States in the WHO African Region.\u00a0WHO Region of the Americas:Between 1 January 2023 and 11 December 2023, a total of 4.1 million suspected dengue cases (cumulative incidence of 419 cases per 100 000 population), including 6710 severe cases (0.16% of suspected cases) and 2049 deaths (CFR 0.05%) were reported from 42 countries and territories in the Region of the Americas, with 15 countries reporting active outbreak. Of the total number of dengue cases until 12 November 2023 (EW 48 of 2023), 1 895 122 (45%) were laboratory confirmed.\u00a0Currently, 46 countries and territories systematically report, through the Health Information Platform for the Americas (PLISA), on a weekly basis, the total number of cases, incidence, number of severe cases, number of deaths and lethality due to dengue, as well as entomological surveillance data. As of EW 48, Brazil has reported the highest number of suspected cases in the Region (n = 2 909 404; 1359 cases per 100 000 population), followed by Peru (n= 271 279; 813 cases per 100 000 population), and Mexico (n = 235 616; 179 cases per 100 000 population). In terms of severe dengue, Colombia reported the most cases (1504; 1.35% of cases), followed by Brazil (1474; 0.05% of cases), Mexico (1272; 0.54% of cases), Peru (1065; 0.39% of cases), and Bolivia (640; 0.44% of cases).\u202f\u202f\u00a0Although dengue is endemic in most countries of South America, Mexico and Central America, and the Caribbean countries, the second half of 2023 has witnessed an alarming increase in cases, with cumulative cases for the year surpassing all previous yearly totals and in some countries extending beyond historically affected areas of transmission. Dengue cases have increased in the Americas over the past four decades, from 1.5 million cases from 1980 to 1989 to 17.5 million in 2010-2019. Before 2023, the highest historical dengue caseload was in 2019, with over 3.18 million cases, 28 208 severe cases, and 1823 deaths (CFR 0.06).\u00a0\u00a0DENV is the most widespread arbovirus and causes the highest number of arboviral disease cases in the Region of the Americas, with cyclic epidemics recurring every 3 to 5 years. Approximately 500 million people in the region are at risk of dengue infection today. Ae. aegypti, the vector mosquito for dengue, is widely distributed in the Americas, only Canada is free from dengue and its vector. In Uruguay, where Ae. Aegypti is present, limited autochthonous transmission was last reported in 2016, and only imported cases have been reported since then.\u00a0All four DENV serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4) are currently circulating in the Americas. DENV-3 and DENV-4 are being detected more frequently in 2023 after several years of predominant detection of DENV-1 and DENV-2. Nevertheless, nine countries are reporting the co-circulation of all four dengue serotypes. Simultaneous circulation of all these serotypes has been detected in Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, and Venezuela. The Arbovirus Diagnosis Laboratory Network of the Americas (RELDA as per its acronym in Spanish) has been strengthened to face the introduction of new dengue serotypes and the re-emergence of other arboviral diseases, such as chikungunya, Zika, and West Nile virus, all of which are currently circulating in the region alongside dengue. The main objective of the network is to ensure efficient laboratory surveillance and robust installed capacity to respond to outbreaks and epidemics.\u00a0WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region:\u00a0Dengue and severe dengue epidemics were first reported in the Region in 1998, and since then, their frequency and geographical spread have increased, with outbreaks occurring in all nine endemic countries: Afghanistan, Djibouti, Egypt, Oman, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen.\u00a0\u00a0Among these are fragile, conflict affected and vulnerable countries such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, Sudan, Somalia and Yemen. The outbreaks are exacerbated due to disruption of health services (Sudan), fragile health systems (Afghanistan, Somalia, Sudan, Pakistan and Yemen), mass population movements, poor water and sanitation infrastructure, and recurring natural disasters such as floods affecting Somalia, Sudan, Pakistan, and Yemen, along with earthquakes in Afghanistan. Outbreaks are also reported in middle- and high-income countries such as Egypt, Oman and Saudi Arabia due to climate change leading to unusual rainfalls. Pakistan (n= 20 072), Saudi Arabia and Oman have reported the highest number of confirmed cases thus far in 2023.\u202f\u202f\u00a0During these epidemics, all four serotypes of dengue virus were known to circulate in the Region. Ae. aegypti is the predominant and primary vector transmitting dengue in the EMR endemic countries. More recently, Bahrain, Iran, and Qatar have reported the presence of Ae. aegypti, although no local transmission of dengue has been documented. Additionally, presence of the secondary vector of dengue, Ae. albopictus, has also been reported from ten EMR countries (Afghanistan, Iran, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Oman, Pakistan, Palestine, Syria and Tunisia).\u202f\u202f\u00a0The effectiveness of response measures is hindered by several factors including i) constrained laboratory capacities ii) challenges in accessing healthcare iii) shortages of human resources iv) limited and inconsistent vector surveillance v) insecticide resistance, vi) poor community engagement and health education vii) a fragmented surveillance system. vii) The ongoing armed hostilities in many Eastern Mediterranean Region countries further compound the complexities of response efforts.\u00a0WHO European Region:\u202f\u00a0Dengue is not endemic in the WHO European Region and cases are mainly travel-related; however, since 2010, there have been reports of autochthonous cases in a number of countries in the region, including Croatia, France, Israel, Italy, Portugal and Spain. In 2018, the year with the most comprehensive data available, a total of 2500 cases of dengue were reported to WHO through the regional annual surveillance data collection mechanism with Germany, France, and the United Kingdom contributing the majority of cases. The vast majority of these cases were imported. However, it should be noted that data completeness remains challenging.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Between 1 January and 5 December 2023, sporadic autochthonous cases and outbreaks have been reported in three countries: Italy (n = 82), France (n = 43) and Spain (n = 3). Routine testing for dengue in Member States of the WHO European Region is not common unless there is a travel history and clinical suspicion, hence the actual numbers of dengue cases in 2023 is likely to be underestimated.\u202fOne death of an imported, travel-related case was reported in Italy; no additional deaths have been reported in European countries in 2023 to date.\u00a0\u00a0The Ae. albopictus mosquito, which is the main vector of dengue virus in Europe, is established in several Southern European countries. Ae. albopictus mosquitoes have been detected further north and west in the past ten years and it has capacity to hibernate in winter. In 2023, this mosquito species has been identified in 13 countries of the region, a notable increase from eight countries in 2013.\u00a0While cold winters prevent year-round transmission of mosquito-borne diseases, the climatic suitability for transmission of DENV in Europe is increasing, leading to floods and stagnant water pools. These create more favorable conditions for the competent vector population.\u202f Ae. aegypti (principal dengue vector in most countries) does not survive over winter well but has been established in Cyprus and Madeira, Portugal since 2022.\u00a0These trends can potentially lead to an increase in the number of dengue cases and possible fatalities.\u00a0Robust public health systems in many countries, including access to early diagnosis, case referral, and management of severe cases, contribute to reduced severe health impact and further disease spread for both imported and autochthonous cases.\u202f\u202f\u202f\u00a0WHO South-East Asia Region:\u202f\u00a0In the WHO Southeast Asia region, 10 out of 11 Member States are known to be endemic for dengue virus. In 2023, several countries, including Bangladesh and Thailand, have reported a notable surge in dengue cases compared to previous years. In particular, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Thailand rank among the world's 30 most highly endemic countries.\u202f\u00a0Compared to 2022, in 2023, Bangladesh and Thailand recorded a larger number of dengue cases . By November 2023, Bangladesh experienced a substantial rise in cases reaching 308 167 compared to 62 382 reported for the entirety of 2022. Thailand saw an increase of over 300%, with dengue cases rising from 46 678 in 2022 to 136 655 in 2023 (as of 22 November 2023). During the same period, the death toll in Bangladesh rose from 281 (CFR 0.45%) to 1598 (CFR 0.52%), while in Thailand, it increased from 34 (CFR 0.07%) to 147 (CFR 0.11%). In other countries, the CFR ranged from 0.04% in Nepal to 0.72% in Indonesia. It's important to interpret these values cautiously due to variations in the case definition used across countries, with some systems primarily focused on reporting hospitalized or severe dengue cases.\u00a0In addition, spatial and temporal shifts in dengue patterns were observed in 2022 and continued in 2023. Nepal and Bangladesh experienced spikes in case numbers earlier than usual. Cases in Nepal shifted from the Kathmandu Valley in 2022 to the southeast Terai region and hill districts in Gandaki province in 2023. India, in 2023, experienced an increase in cases in Kerala and northeastern States bordering Bangladesh compared to the previous year.\u00a0WHO Western Pacific Region:\u00a0The Western Pacific Region continues to face a high burden of mosquito-borne arboviral diseases, particularly dengue. These diseases cause significant morbidity and mortality, especially among those unreached by quality primary health care (PHC) services.\u00a0\u00a0Between 1 January 2023 to 7 December 2023, over 500 000 dengue cases and 750 deaths were reported from eight countries/territories/areas in the WHO Western Pacific Region: Australia, Cambodia, China, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Viet Nam. The most affected countries are the Philippines, reporting 167 355 cases and 575 deaths (CFR 0.34%), and Viet Nam with 149 557 cases and 36 deaths (CFR: 0.02%). Dengue is endemic in several countries such as Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, the Philippines, and Viet Nam.\u202f\u202f\u00a0In Pacific Island countries/territories (n = 21), in 2023, dengue-like illness1 was reported from nine Pacific countries/territories, resulting in a total of 13 339 cases, a 28% increase reported as of 30 November compared to 2022. Among the most affected are Fiji, which reported 8418 cases in 2022 and 11 522 cases and 2023, reflecting a 37% increase.\u202f\u202f\u00a0Member States with endemic transmission continue to report longer seasonal dengue epidemics with increasing magnitude and geographic spread. However, disease incidence is less reliable due to the underreporting of cases, particularly in the Pacific Island Countries and territories based on their current syndromic surveillance of dengue as dengue-like illness (DLI) reporting system. Furthermore, the reported number of deaths due to severe dengue is variable. As such, country-level and sub-national case fatality rates (CFR) may appear inconsistent.\u202f\u202f\u00a0Due to the endemicity of dengue and public health burden in the Western Pacific Region, in 2008, the Regional Committee for WPR endorsed the Dengue Strategic Plan for the Asia Pacific Region 2008-2015 (resolution WPR/RC59.R6), serving as a road map. Subsequently, in 2016, considering the growing regional trends in dengue morbidity and mortality, the Western Pacific Regional Action Plan for Dengue Prevention and Control was developed. This plan recommended a switch in strategy from outbreak containment to reducing the impact of dengue on communities.\u202f\u202fThere is a window of opportunity for Pacific countries/territories to improve the adherence to the existing WHO \u201cFramework for National Surveillance and control plans for Aedes vectors\u201d in the Pacific for non-endemic countries in the Pacific Region. Given the impact of climate change on the spread and endemicities of Arboviral diseases, establishing a comprehensive Early Warning System (EWS) that integrates climate, disease, viral/ serological, and entomology surveillance is crucial. Such a system has the potential to predict future risks in vulnerable communities.",
        "Epidemiology": "Dengue virus (DENV) is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes typically in tropical and sub-tropical climates worldwide, mostly in urban and semi-urban areas. The primary vectors that transmit the disease are Aedes aegypti and, to a lesser extent, Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, though in some regions such as Europe and North America this latter vector is more widespread.\u00a0\u00a0DENV has four serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4). Infection with one serotype provides long-term immunity to the same serotype and only transient immunity to the other serotypes, after which secondary infections with a different serotype increase the risk for severe dengue. Dengue cases are most commonly asymptomatic or result in mild febrile illness. However, some cases will develop severe dengue, which may involve shock, severe bleeding or severe organ impairment. This stage often starts after the fever has gone away and it is preceded by warning signs such as intense abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, bleeding gums, fluid accumulation, lethargy or restlessness, and liver enlargement.\u00a0 \u00a0There is no specific treatment for dengue, but the timely diagnosis of dengue cases, identification of warning signs for severe dengue, and appropriate clinical management are key elements of care to prevent the progression to severe dengue and deaths.",
        "Public Health Response": "Heterogeneity in capacity across Member States impacts the ability to detect and respond to DENV endemic and epidemic transmission. While the majority of the countries in the Americas, South-East Asian and Western-Pacific regions are endemic for the disease and have the capacity to manage cases, a few countries do not mandate reporting of dengue cases and thus under- or non-reporting of cases results in pockets of vulnerability within regions. Simultaneous outbreaks across multiple WHO regions strain the capacity for epidemic response. The overall capacity to respond to multiple, concurrent outbreaks continues to be strained due to the global lack of resources, including shortages of good quality dengue diagnostic kits for early detection, lack of trained clinical and vector control staff, and lack of resources to support risk community and community engagement interventions. Prevention and control of dengue continue to be variable due to changes in the predominant circulating serotypes and co-circulation of multiple dengue serotypes in the different regions, limited funding, competing health priorities and diverse perceptions about the effectiveness of interventions and control measures. Surveillance and response capacity is particularly limited in many countries in the African region, and as stated earlier, five of the Eastern Mediterranean Member States with DENV are dealing with conflicts and natural disasters.\u00a0\u00a0There is a pressing need to increase advocacy and resource mobilization in an integrated approach to influence policymakers in affected countries within these regions.\u202f\u00a0The following activities are being undertaken at WHO to support Member States in the response to this event.\u00a0\u00a0Coordination and leadership\u00a0Establishment of a Global Joint Incident Management Support Team (IMST) at WHO, involving WHO Health Emergencies Programme (Response and Preparedness departments) and technical expertise from the Neglected Tropical Disease department to support the response to outbreaks.\u202fImplementation of integrated response aligned with the overarching Global Arbovirus Initiative.\u202f\u202f\u202fThe Global Arbovirus Initiative is an integrated strategic plan to tackle emerging and re-emerging arboviruses with epidemic and pandemic potential focusing on monitoring risk, pandemic prevention, preparedness, detection and response, and building a coalition of partners.

        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Recent data from 2023 emphasize escalated dengue outbreaks in several countries, particularly Bangladesh, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Fiji, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Viet Nam. Additionally, non-endemic countries are increasingly facing dengue as a significant public health concern. The emergence and re-emergence of dengue and its unprecedented worldwide spread are linked to various factors:\u202f i) Changing distribution and adaptation of the Aedes aegypti vector; ii) increased unplanned urbanization and human activities fostering conducive environments for vector-host interaction; iii) Climate change-induced shifts in weather patterns; iv) Fragile healthcare systems amidst political and financial instabilities; v) Co-circulation of multiple dengue serotypes; vi) Challenges in clinical diagnosis due to non-specific symptoms; vii) Inadequate laboratory and testing capacity; viii) Prolonged ongoing concurrent outbreaks, including COVID-19; ix) Lack of specific treatment for dengue; x) Limited behavioral data available on community risk perceptions, awareness and health seeking behaviors: xi) Lack of community centered approach and RCCE resources to support engagement and mobilization of local communities in vector control activities; xi) Insufficient vector surveillance and control capacities and, xii) Lack of coordination among stakeholders, chronic underfunding,\u202f low donor interest and xii) large scale movement of people and goods.\u202f\u202f\u00a0The expansion of DENV beyond its endemic transmission areas presents additional challenges.\u00a0 A significant population that is immunologically na\u00efve to the current virus circulating, increasing the risk of outbreaks. Moreover, people in these areas might lack awareness of dengue warning signs, leading to potential delays in seeking health care which is critical to reducing mortality from severe disease.\u202f\u202fAccessibility challenges to medical facilities, compounded by limited geographical access, heighten the difficulty in accessing basic healthcare services. \u202fThese challenges are aggravated by stockouts of essential supplies for prevention and control, laboratory diagnostic reagents, and the need for ongoing training of healthcare workers.\u202f\u00a0These factors, along with others, including financial crises, mass migration of internally displaced persons (IDPs) and refugees, and longstanding developmental inadequacies, have deprived large populations across all continents of adequate healthcare, consequently increasing their vulnerability to dengue. However, it is important to note that the distribution of dengue risk varies significantly across regions, countries, and within countries.\u202f\u202f\u00a0Based on all the above WHO has assessed the risk at global level as high. Following the risk assessment and an internal grading process, WHO Regional Offices have agreed on priority interventions to implement in support of Member States.\u00a0Dengue prevention and outbreak response involves several agencies in the public health sector. Addressing these challenges requires a multidisciplinary and multisectoral integrated approach, especially at national level to achieve its goal of reducing the impact on public health. The strain on epidemic response capacity due to simultaneous concurrent outbreaks coupled with political crises highlights the need for robust emergency response mechanisms and strengthened collaboration among stakeholders. The global lack of resources, including shortages of good quality dengue diagnostic kits for early detection, lack of trained clinical and vector control personnel, and community awareness remain a critical obstacle to an effective response. While coordination efforts with global health organizations like WHO and other partners strive to set common priorities and analyses, the need for continuous support to affected countries and enhanced collaboration is imperative.",
        "WHO Advice": "Effective vector control measures:\u00a0Effective vector control is key to the prevention and control of the DENV. Vector control activities should target all areas where there is a risk of human-vector contact, such as residences, workplaces, schools, and hospitals. WHO promotes Integrated Vector Management (IVM) to control Aedes species. IVM should include removing potential breeding sites, reducing vector populations, and minimizing individual exposure. This should involve vector control strategies for larvae and adults (i.e., environmental management and source reduction), especially monitoring water storage practices, draining and cleaning household water storage containers weekly, larvicide in non-potable water using WHO-prequalified larvicides at correct dosages, distribution of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) for fever/dengue inpatients to contain spread of the virus from health facilities. Indoor space spraying for rapidly containing dengue-infected mosquitoes may be challenging to deliver in densely populated areas.\u202f\u202f\u00a0The Global Arbovirus Initiative promotes coordination and collaboration among multisectoral partners, an integrated vector management approach and sustained control measures at all levels. Its guiding principle is to harmonize prevention, surveillance (entomological and epidemiological) and case management with existing health systems, such that they are sustainable, cost-effective and ecologically sound.\u00a0\u00a0Personal Protective Measures:\u00a0\u00a0Personal protective measures during outdoor activities include topical repellents to exposed skin or the treatment of clothing and using long-sleeved shirts and pants. Additionally, indoor protection can include the use of household insecticide aerosol products, or mosquito coils during the day. Window and door screens can reduce the probability of mosquitoes entering the house. Insecticide-treated nets offer good protection to people against mosquito bites while sleeping during the day. Since Aedes mosquitoes are most active at dawn and dusk, personal protective measures are recommended particularly at these times of day. Personal protection measures and mosquito control should also cover workplaces and schools since the vectors are day-biting mosquitoes.\u202f\u00a0Entomological Surveillance:\u00a0Entomological surveillance should be undertaken to assess the breeding potential of Aedes mosquitoes in containers and monitor insecticide resistance to help select the most effective insecticide-based interventions.\u202f\u00a0Case management:\u00a0There is no specific treatment for dengue infection. However, early detection and access to appropriate healthcare for case management can reduce mortality, as can rapid detection of severe dengue cases and timely referrals to tertiary healthcare facilities.\u202f\u202f\u00a0Most people with dengue have mild or no symptoms and will get better in 1\u20132 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0Individuals who are infected for the second time are at greater risk of severe dengue. Severe dengue symptoms often come after the fever has gone away such as:\u00a0severe abdominal pain\u00a0persistent vomiting\u00a0rapid breathing bleeding gums or nose\u00a0\u00a0fatigue restlessness blood in vomit or stool being very thirsty pale and cold skin feeling weak. People with these severe symptoms should get care right away.\u00a0Enhanced case surveillance:\u00a0Case surveillance should be enhanced in all affected countries and globally. Where feasible, resources should be allocated for the strengthening of surveillance to determine the overall dengue burden (i.e., including outpatient cases), counting severe and fatal cases, and for the confirmation and sub-typing of the dengue virus.\u202f\u202f\u00a0Operational research and learning from successful examples:\u00a0Countries must learn and adopt successful examples of effective case management, prevention, community engagement, and vector control of dengue and other arboviruses through heightened research projects, particularly given the recent WHO recommendations on clinical trials.\u00a0\u00a0Ministries of Health and partners should closely review local interventions to accept and recommend them for public health programmes for early adaptation to reduce the growing health impact of dengue.\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u00a0WHO does not recommend that any general travel or trade restrictions be applied to countries/territories/areas based on the available information.",

        "Date Reported": "8 December 2023",
        "Location": "Zambia",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 1 November 2023, the International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Point of Zambia notified WHO of an anthrax outbreak in humans. The first human cases were reported from the Dengeza Health Post in the Sinazongwe District of the Southern Province on 5 May 2023. Around the same time period, domestic (cattle and goats) and wild animals (hippopotami) were reportedly dying from an unknown cause in the surrounding areas. In June 2023, human and animal cases were reported in the Kanchindu and Siameja veterinary camps of Sinazongwe District. Twenty-six human cases developed sores on their face, arms, and fingers after consuming meat from three wild hippopotamus carcasses. The first human case was reported on 16 June 2023 and laboratory confirmed by culture at the Lusaka Central Veterinary Research Institute (CVRI).\nAs of 20 November 2023, 684 suspected human cases, including four deaths, a Case Fatality Ratio (CFR)of 0.6%, were reported from 44 out of 116 districts in nine of Zambia\u2019s 10 provinces. Sinazongwe district is the epicenter, accounting for 287 cases (42% of total 684 cases) and two deaths (50% of total the four deaths). The most affected provinces are the Southern (370 cases; 54 %), Western (88; 13%), Lusaka (82; 12%), Eastern (66; 10%) and Muchinga (47; 7 %) Provinces. The majority of symptomatic cases were epidemiologically linked to confirmed cases and not tested.\nThis unprecedented outbreak marks the first major occurrence spanning nine out of 10 country provinces. The latest large-scale outbreak reported in Zambia occurred in 2011 with a total of 511 suspected cases.\nResponse activities have been taken from both human and animal sides, such as active surveillance, case management, laboratory diagnosis, health promotion, and Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE), meat inspection and livestock vaccination.\nAnthrax is a zoonotic disease caused by a bacteria called Bacillus anthracis that typically affects ruminants (such as cows, sheep, and goats). The bacteria produce extremely potent toxins which are responsible for the symptoms, causing a high lethality rate in the pulmonary form. Humans can develop the disease from infected animals or through contaminated animal products. Hospitalization is required for all human cases identified. Vaccines are available for livestock and humans in limited supply.\nThe risk of the event spreading within Zambia is assessed to be high due to the unrestricted animal movement and carcasses within and between provinces. The risk at the regional level is also considered high due to the frequent movement of both animals and people between Zambia and its neighbouring countries (such as Angola, Botswana, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe).",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 1 November 2023, the IHR National Focal Point of Zambia notified WHO of an anthrax outbreak in humans. The first human cases were reported from the Dengeza Health Post in the Sinazongwe District of the Southern Province on 5 May 2023. Around the same period, domestic (cattle and goats) and wild animals (hippopotami) were reportedly dying from an unknown cause in the surrounding areas. While Zambia typically reports sporadic cases of anthrax annually, the investigation revealed that from September 2022 to January 2023, 42 suspected cases of anthrax in humans had been recorded at the Dengeza Health Post. All the cases presented at health facilities with skin sores and ulcers, and some of them developed nonspecific symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, difficulty in breathing). Human specimens were collected during the investigation and sent to the Lusaka Central Veterinary Research Institute (CVRI) for testing. The initial samples collected and tested by culture returned negative for anthrax.In June 2023, human and animal cases were reported in the Kanchindu and Siameja veterinary camps of Sinazongwe district.\u00a0 Twenty-six human cases developed sores on their face, arms, and fingers after consuming meat from three wild hippopotamus carcasses. The first human case was reported on 16 June 2023 and laboratory confirmed by culture at the Lusaka CVRI. On the animal side, 13 domestic animals including cattle (10) and goats (3) out of Sinazongwe district susceptible population of 65 000 (30 000 cattle and 35 000 goats), under free range extensive traditional management, died of suspected anthrax. Cattle and goat specimens tested by culture at the Lusaka CVRI returned positive for anthrax on 17 July 2023. Until 1 November, anthrax outbreaks affecting animals and humans were reported in other Southern, Northwestern, and Western provinces. As of 20 November 2023, 684 suspected human cases, including four deaths (CFR 0.6%) were reported from 44 out of 116 districts in nine of Zambia\u2019s 10 provinces. Sinazongwe district is the epicenter, accounting for 287 cases (42% of total 684 cases) and two deaths (50% of total the four deaths).\u00a0 The most affected provinces are the Southern (370 cases; 54 %), Western (84; 12%), Lusaka (82; 12%), Eastern (66; 10%) and Muchinga (47; 7 %) Provinces. The majority of symptomatic cases were epidemiologically linked to confirmed cases and not tested.On the animal side, as of 21 November 2023, 568 domestic and wild animal cases were reported across 11 districts in Eastern, Southern, and Western provinces, with (344; 61%) occurring in the Southern province, (132; 23%) in the Muchinga province and (62, 11%) in the Western Province. Cases in wildlife, primarily hippos, were reported in the Eastern and Southern provinces.This outbreak marks the first major occurrence spanning nine out of 10 country provinces. Previous outbreaks were confined to Northwest and Western provinces, with sporadic cases over the years. Of note, Zambia reported anthrax outbreaks in both human and animals in Western Province in 2017 and in Eastern Province in 2016 and 2011.Figure 1. Distribution of anthrax cases by province, Zambia, as of 20 November 2023",
        "Epidemiology": "Anthrax is a disease caused by a spore-forming bacteria called Bacillus anthracis. It is a zoonosis (disease transmissible from animals to humans) that affects ruminants (such as cows, sheep, and goats). Anthrax does not typically spread from animal to animal or human to human. \u00a0When anthrax spores are ingested from contaminated animal products, inhaled, or enter the body through skin abrasions or cuts, they can germinate, multiply and produce toxins. Depending on the type of exposure, within a few hours to three weeks, individuals may present one of the three clinical presentations of anthrax. Cutaneous or skin anthrax is the most common presenting with an itchy bump in the exposed area that rapidly develops into a black sore. Some people then develop headaches, muscle aches, fever, and vomiting. Gastrointestinal anthrax causes initial symptoms similar to food poisoning, but can worsen to produce severe abdominal pain, vomiting of blood and severe diarrhoea. Pulmonary anthrax, the most severe presentation, has initial symptomatology of a common cold but can rapidly progress to severe breathing difficulties and shock. Diagnosis can be made through polychrome methylene blue-stained blood smears, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Hospitalization is required for all human cases identified. Individuals exposed may receive prophylactic treatment. Antibiotics, particularly penicillin, are effective against this disease. Prompt treatment can reduce case-fatality rate to <1%. Vaccines are also available for livestock and humans in limited supply.\u00a0 Human vaccines are limited to those with possible occupational exposure.",
        "Public Health Response": "Response activities have been taken from both human and animal sides. Actions taken for animalsWith the support of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), livestock vaccination is ongoing. In total 338 000 doses of anthrax vaccine have been distributed up to 19 November 2023. Vaccination campaigns have been initiated at the outbreak epicentre, Sinazongwe district, and is extended to other affected districts. A joint One Health task force comprising the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Local Government has been conducting case finding in animals and humans. Meat inspection is enhanced by the veterinary department. \u00a0Additionally, the Department of Wildlife and Parks has been actively involved, conducting patrols to monitor illegal animal movements and ensuring proper disposal of carcasses. WHO is working closely with FAO and the Ministry of Agriculture on animal health activities like vaccination.Actions implemented for humansWHO is supporting and working closely with the Ministry of Health in the following activities. For case management, health workers have undergone orientation to enhance their capacities to identify potential cases early on. Efforts have been made to strengthen event-based surveillance (EBS) and early detection mechanisms. Provision of essential medical supplies has been prioritized, in addition to public sensitization. Active surveillance is ongoing across healthcare facilities and within communities, including contact tracing.Meat inspections are being conducted in abattoirs and butcher shops. Preparedness plans are in place, including the mobilization of additional healthcare personnel to districts, foreseeing a potential surge in anthrax cases. Moreover, specialized training sessions for provincial practitioners aim to improve case management proficiency in the provinces.The laboratory continues to operate under a unified One Health approach for diagnostics. Procurement efforts for laboratory reagents are underway due to shortages. Strict protocols for disinfection and decontamination remain ongoing to ensure safety. Extensive health promotion and Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE) activities are ongoing, including press briefings by Ministry of Health, social media campaigns, radio broadcasts, and the distribution of informative brochures and posters.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Anthrax is endemic in Zambia, usually occurring between May and January, with a peak toward the end of the dry season (between October and November). Although sporadic cases are reported yearly in animals and humans across the country, a large-scale outbreak like the current one has not been reported since 2011, when there were 511 suspected human cases.The epidemic is spreading along the provinces located along the basin of the Zambezi, Kafue, and Luangwa rivers, which is an additional problem because these rivers also flow into Lake Kariba in Zimbabwe, Kahora Bassa in Mozambique and Lake Malawi, and the risk of anthrax transmission to neighbouring countries is increased.Other affected districts and provinces of Zambia have reported sporadic suspected cases and deaths since June 2023. In addition, the Bacillus anthracis bacteria can form highly resistant spores that survive in the environment for decades The risk for human health is high given the known population\u2019s multiple exposures from handling the carcasses of animals that had died suddenly and eating meat from infected animals with resultant associated cutaneous and gastrointestinal anthrax. The risk of the event spreading within Zambia has increased due to the unrestricted animal movement and carcasses within and between provinces. Since September 2023, there has been a significant rise in the number of affected districts. Moreover, a low index of suspicion, socio-cultural norms, community resistance, limited community knowledge regarding anthrax transmission, high levels of poverty and food insecurity, a shortage of available vaccines and laboratory reagents, inadequate carcass disposal and decontamination practices significantly contribute to hampering the containment of the anthrax outbreak. There is an absence of robust engagement with local communities involved in breeding and handling cattle and livestock, including farmers, heads of cattle markets, and butchers. Among these communities, the fear of losing livelihoods often outweighs concerns about contracting anthrax. The risk of insufficient control capacities is considered high in Zambia due to concurrent public health emergencies in the country (cholera, measles, COVID-19) that limit the country\u2019s human and financial capacities to respond to the current anthrax outbreak adequately.The risk at the regional level is also considered high due to the frequent movement of both animals and people between Zambia and its neighbouring countries (such as Angola, Botswana, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe). This is compounded by the confirmed cases of anthrax spreading in provinces located along the basin of the Zambezi, Kafue, and Luangwa rivers. These rivers ultimately flow into Lake Kariba in Zimbabwe, the Kahora Bassa lake in Mozambique, and Lake Malawi. Unburied carcasses of wild animals that float on the river increase the risk of international spread to neighbouring countries. They can spread the bacterium and infections to other regions, including neighbouring countries, and be eaten by other animals, which can further perpetuate the spread.",
        "WHO Advice": "Humans usually acquire the infection after exposure to infected animals, carcasses, or animal products. More than 95% of human anthrax cases take the cutaneous form and result from handling infected carcasses or hides, hair, meat or bones from such carcasses. The public should avoid handling and consumption of meat from animals that died suddenly, meat obtained via emergency slaughter, and meat of uncertain origin. Anthrax can also be an occupational hazard for veterinarians, agriculture and wildlife workers, or workers who butcher animals or process meat, hides, hair, and wool and should wear preventive clothing and gloves or personal protection equipment (PPE). In health-care settings, it is crucial to enhance screening procedures specifically in areas where there is a known epidemiological risk of anthrax. It is imperative to anticipate and implement infection prevention and control measures promptly when cases are suspected. When caring for patients with draining anthrax lesions, implementing contact precautions is vital. This includes placing the patient in a private room and the use of PPE (such as examination gloves and a fluid resistant gown). Additionally, dressings may be used to contain drainage and reduce the risk of environmental contamination. These dressings should be disposed of as infectious waste after use. The WHO\u2019s 5 Moments for hand hygiene should be practiced using soap and water when caring for suspected and confirmed cases, as alcohol-based hand rub has weakened effect against spores. For areas where patients with suspected or confirmed exposure to anthrax spores are being cared for, it is recommended to implement enhanced cleaning and disinfection protocols.Individuals potentially exposed to anthrax spores should receive prophylactic treatment. Anthrax responds well to antibiotics, which need to be prescribed by a medical professional. Strict adherence to the full course of treatment is vital. Human vaccines are in limited supply and used primarily for the protection of selected individuals with possible occupational exposure to anthrax.International travelers to anthrax endemic countries should be aware of regulations concerning the importation of prohibited animal products, trophies, and souvenirs.Anthrax is controlled through animal vaccination programs, rapid detection and reporting, quarantine, treatment of sub clinically affected animals (postexposure prophylaxis) and burning or burial of suspect and confirmed animal cases. The carcass should not be opened since exposure to oxygen will allow the bacteria to form spores. The general public and at-risk individuals should immediately report instances of sick or unexpected deaths in animals to veterinary authorities. Veterinary vaccines are used for control of anthrax in livestock. Vaccination protocols for livestock should be strictly followed to curb anthrax spread. Preventing the disease in animals will protect human health. \u00a0WHO advises against implementing any travel or trade restrictions based on the current information available on this event.",

        "Outbreak name": "Influenza A(H1N2) variant virus infection",
        "Date Reported": "1 December 2023",
        "Location": "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 25 November 2023, the International Health Regulations National Focal Point (IHR NFP) of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (United Kingdom) notified the World Health Organization (WHO) of a human case of swine-origin influenza A(H1N2) virus infection. This is the first swine influenza A(H1N2)v case reported in the United Kingdom. Human infections with swine-origin influenza viruses have been sporadically detected in the past in countries in the Americas, Asia, Australia and Europe.\nWhen a human is infected with a swine-origin influenza virus, the virus is referred to as a variant (or \u201cv\u201d) virus. Most human cases result from exposure to swine influenza viruses through direct contact with infected swine or contaminated environments. Current evidence suggests that these swine-origin influenza viruses have limited ability for sustained transmission among humans.\nThis case was identified as part of routine surveillance of respiratory illnesses. The source of infection for this case is under investigation and contact tracing is in process. To date, no other confirmed cases associated with this event have been reported. WHO is in communication with national authorities to monitor the situation closely. Ongoing investigations are in place to identify the source of the infection and to characterize the risks of this influenza variant virus.\nWHO assesses the risk of spread of swine-origin influenza viruses through humans and/or community-level spread among humans as low. However, because these viruses continue to be detected in swine populations worldwide, further human cases following direct or indirect contact with infected swine can be expected. Current evidence suggests that these viruses have not acquired the ability to sustain transmission among humans.\nDue to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect virological, epidemiological and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health and timely virus sharing for risk assessment.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 25 November 2023, under the IHR (2005), the United Kingdom notified the WHO of a human case of influenza A(H1N2)v virus infection. The case reported onset of mild symptoms on 5 November.\u00a0 He visited his general practitioner on 9 November; during this visit, a respiratory sample was collected and further analyzed as part of the national routine influenza surveillance programme. On 13 November, the sample was sent to United Kingdom Health Security Agency (UKHSA) laboratories and tested positive on 23 November for influenza A(H1N2)v virus, using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The sample was further characterized by whole genome sequencing and results were available on the same date. On 25 November, a follow-up RT-PCR test was performed and tested negative for influenza.\u00a0\u00a0 The case is now fully recovered.\u00a0Further laboratory analyses conducted at the Worldwide Influenza Centre at the Francis Crick Institute (a WHO Collaborating Centre) and the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH) avian and swine influenza reference laboratory at the Animal and Plant Health Agency, indicated that this influenza A(H1N2)v virus belongs to the swine influenza virus genetic clade 1B.1.1. Similar A(H1N2) viruses from this genetic clade have been previously detected in pigs in the United Kingdom. However, this is the first time a virus from this swine genetic clade has been detected in a human in the United Kingdom.\u00a0According to ongoing investigations, pig farms are located within a few miles of where the case resides; however, the case reported no direct exposure to pigs, pets, or farms.\u00a0 The source of infection is currently under investigation and contact tracing is continuing.",
        "Epidemiology": "Influenza A viruses are enzootic in swine populations in most regions of the world. When an influenza virus that normally circulates in swine is detected in a person, it is called a \u201cvariant influenza virus\u201d. A(H1N1), A(H1N2) and A(H3N2) are major subtypes of influenza viruses circulating in pigs and occasionally infect humans.\u00a0Sporadic human infections with swine influenza viruses have been reported since the late 1950s, usually after direct or indirect exposure to pigs or contaminated environments. Since 2018, sporadic influenza A(H1N2)v cases among humans have been detected in other countries in Europe (Austria, Denmark, France and the Netherlands), the Americas (Brazil, Canada and the United States of America), Asia (China) and in Australia. Infections in humans have primarily been acquired through direct contact with infected animals or contaminated environments. Risk factors include proximity to infected pigs or visiting locations where pigs are exhibited. However, in some cases, no known exposure to swine was reported.\u00a0Swine-origin influenza virus infections in humans tend to result in mild clinical illness, although some cases have been hospitalized with more severe disease and some have been fatal. Evidence of human-to-human spread of swine-origin influenza viruses is limited, and human-to-human onward transmissions are very rare or limited to one or two generations of infection.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Laboratory testing with RT-PCR or other rapid molecular influenza assays (with similar high sensitivity and high specificity) are recommended when available. However, prompt treatment based on antivirals and supportive care should be the priority. WHO has produced guidelines for laboratory diagnosis of influenza and clinical management, and through the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), WHO closely monitors avian, swine and other zoonotic influenza viruses.",
        "Public Health Response": "WHO is closely collaborating with national authorities to monitor the situation. UKHSA has established an enhanced national incident team that is working with partners to investigate this incident and deliver a rapid response. Ongoing response activities by the UKHSA, the United Kingdom National Health Service and international partners include:\u00a0Local epidemiological investigations and public health management, have been implemented, including case investigation, contact tracing and enhanced local surveillance for persons with occupational exposure to pigs/farms and the wider local community.\u00a0Laboratory investigations are being conducted in collaboration with the UKHSA, Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) and the Crick Institute laboratories to further understand the virological characteristics of this virus.\u00a0\u00a0Communications activities, including ensuring proportionate communications to partners within government, with the National Health Service and international partners, have been implemented.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Influenza viruses circulate in swine populations in many regions of the world. Depending on geographic location, the genetic characteristics of these viruses differ. Most human cases result from exposure to swine influenza viruses through contact with infected swine or contaminated environments, although some cases have been reported without an apparent source of exposure to swine in the weeks prior to illness onset. Because these viruses continue to be detected in swine populations worldwide, further human cases following direct or indirect contact with infected swine can be expected.\u00a0Current evidence suggests that these viruses have not acquired the ability to sustain transmission among humans. There has been limited, non-sustained human-to-human transmission of variant influenza viruses, although ongoing community transmission has not been identified.\u00a0This is the first swine influenza A(H1N2)v case reported in the United Kingdom. There is no clear indication of direct contact with pigs or any ill individuals.\u00a0 Though the source of infection is unknown at this time, the virus is closely aligned to that circulating in the swine population in the United Kingdom. Several previous variant cases have also not had clear exposure histories to swine and there was no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission in these cases. Limited human-to-human transmission may have played a role, but there is no definitive evidence.\u00a0Further virus characterization is ongoing. National routine surveillance indicators do not show any unusual increases in respiratory illness in the local population. The risk of there being additional human cases associated with this event appears to be low \u2013 though the possibility of limited person-to-person transmission cannot be excluded at this stage.\u00a0The risk assessment will be reviewed should further epidemiological or virological information become available.",
        "WHO Advice": "People with any respiratory symptoms should continue to follow the existing guidance, seek healthcare and avoid contact with other people while symptoms persist, particularly if the people they are coming into contact with are elderly or have existing medical conditions.\u00a0Surveillance:\u00a0This case does not change the current WHO recommendations on public health measures and seasonal influenza surveillance.\u00a0WHO does not advise special traveler screening at points of entry or restrictions concerning the current situation of influenza viruses at the human-animal interface.\u00a0 Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect virological, epidemiological and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health and timely virus sharing for risk assessment. Notification and investigation:\u00a0\u00a0All human infections caused by a novel influenza subtype are notifiable under the IHR (2005) and State Parties are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic. Evidence of illness is not required.\u00a0In the case of a confirmed or suspected human infection caused by a novel influenza virus with pandemic potential, including a variant virus, a thorough epidemiologic investigation of a history of exposure to animals, travel, and contact tracing should be conducted. The epidemiologic investigation should include early identification of unusual respiratory events that could signal person-to-person transmission of the novel virus. Clinical samples collected from the time and place of the case should be tested and sent to a WHO Collaboration Centre for further characterization.\u00a0\u00a0Prevention measures:\u00a0General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.\u00a0Travelers to countries with known outbreaks of animal influenza should avoid farms, contact with animals in live animal markets, entering areas where animals may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with animal feces. Travelers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travelers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices. Influenza viruses that infect pigs are different from human influenza viruses. There is no vaccine for zoonotic influenza infection licensed for use in humans. However, some partners have developed candidate vaccine viruses for novel zoonotic influenza viruses with pandemic potential as part of pandemic preparedness activities.\u00a0Usually, influenza vaccines against human influenza viruses are generally not expected to protect people from influenza viruses that normally circulate in pigs. Although the seasonal influenza vaccine does not protect against swine viruses, WHO recommends seasonal influenza vaccination to avoid severe disease.\u00a0In health-care settings, syndromic screening of health and care workers, patients, and visitors for symptoms of respiratory infections is recommended, accompanied with capacity and resources to implement transmission-based precautions to reduce the risk of health care-associated infections. If a case of a novel acute respiratory infection is suspected, please refer to advice in the WHO guideline for infection prevention and control of epidemic-and pandemic prone acute respiratory infections in health care. WHO does not recommend any travel and/or trade restrictions for the United Kingdom based on the currently available information.",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "Between 24 and 25 November 2023, the Ministry of Health of Cambodia notified WHO of two confirmed cases of human infection with influenza A(H5N1) from the same village in Kampot Province. Both cases were female, one in the 20-25 years age group and the other less than five years old. The first reported case visited a public hospital four days after having symptoms of fever, shortness of breath and cough. Samples were collected, which tested positive for H5N1, and the case died while in hospital. The second reported case was detected during enhanced surveillance by the public health authorities in response to the confirmation of the first reported case. The case had fever, cough and rash and is currently being treated in hospital. Epidemiological investigation shows both cases had exposure to backyard birds, which were reported to be sick, with some having died, over the prior month.\nThe Ministry of Health's national and sub-national rapid response teams are investigating the source of the infection and coordinating response activities, including but not limited to active surveillance for additional cases, identifying close contacts for monitoring, and conducting health education campaigns to prevent transmission in the community.\nIn total, six cases of influenza A(H5N1) have been reported from Cambodia this year. Influenza A(H5N1) infection in humans can cause severe disease, has a high mortality rate, and is notifiable under the International Health Regulations (2005).",
        "Description of the Situation": "The Ministry of Health of Cambodia notified WHO of two confirmed human cases of influenza A (H5N1) between 24 and 25 November 2023. The cases resided in the same village in Kampot Province. Both cases were females, one in the age group of 20-25 years and the other less than 5 years old. The first reported case developed fever, cough and shortness of breath on 19 November 2023, was treated at home for several days, and then visited a hospital on 23 November. At the hospital, samples were collected and transported to the National Institute of Public Health for testing and was subsequently confirmed as influenza A(H5N1) by RT-qPCR assays at the National Laboratory at National Institute of Public Health and reconfirmed by Institute Pasteur du Cambodge. The case was admitted and in intensive care at the hospital and passed away on 26 November 2023. The second reported case was detected during active surveillance in response to the first reported case, for additional cases with clinical presentation including fever, cough and rash. The case was transported to hospital on 25 November 2023 for testing with samples returning positive for influenza A(H5N1) by RT-qPCR assays at the National Laboratory at National Institute of Public Health and reconfirmed by at the Institute Pasteur du Cambodge. The case is currently admitted in an isolation room in the respiratory ward of the hospital and undergoing treatment. Epidemiological investigation shows both cases had exposure to backyard birds which were reported to be sick and dead, over the past month. No epidemiological linkage of these cases has yet been confirmed other than that they both resided in the same village.Laboratory investigation shows the viruses, as indicated by phylogenetic analysis, fall within the H5 clade 2.3.2.1c with close similarity to the viruses that have been circulating in Cambodia and Southeast Asia since 2013-2014. The sequences cluster most closely with the viruses from the two human cases reported in October 2023.",
        "Epidemiology": "Animal influenza viruses normally circulate in animals but can also infect humans. Infections in humans have primarily been acquired through direct contact with infected animals or contaminated environments. Depending on the original host, influenza A viruses can be classified as avian influenza, swine influenza, or other types of animal influenza viruses.Avian, swine, and other animal influenza virus infections in humans may cause disease ranging from mild upper respiratory tract infection to more severe diseases and can be fatal. Conjunctivitis, gastrointestinal symptoms, encephalitis and encephalopathy have also been reported. There have also been several detections of A(H5N1) virus in asymptomatic persons but who had exposure to infected birds in the days before a sample was collected.Laboratory tests are required to diagnose human infection with influenza. WHO periodically updates technical guidance protocols for the detection of zoonotic influenza using molecular methods, e.g. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Evidence suggests that some antiviral drugs, notably neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir), can reduce the duration of viral replication and improve prospects of survival in some cases.The confirmed cases are the fifth and sixth cases of human infection with influenza A(H5N1) reported from Cambodia in 2023, and the fourth reported death in 2023. From 2003 until now, 62 cases of human infection with influenza A(H5N1), including 41 deaths, have been reported from Cambodia.",
        "Public Health Response": "The Ministry of Health's national and sub-national rapid response teams, with support from the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, and the Ministry of Environment, have initiated and coordinated the detailed investigation of the avian influenza outbreak in Kampot Province including searching for additional suspected cases and contacts, collecting and testing samples from backyard birds and conducting health education campaigns to prevent transmission in the community.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "From 2003 to 27 November 2023, a total of 882 human cases of infection with influenza A(H5N1), including 461 deaths, have been reported globally from 23 countries. Almost all cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) have been linked to close contact with infected live or dead birds, or influenza A(H5N1)-contaminated environments. Based on evidence so far, the virus does not infect humans easily and spread from person-to-person appears to be unusual. Human infection can cause severe disease and has a high mortality rate. Since the virus continues to circulate in poultry, particularly in rural areas in Cambodia, the potential for further sporadic human cases can be expected. In these two cases, while human-to-human transmission cannot be ruled out, it is likely there were separate exposures to the viruses from sick and dead chickens. In the past, small clusters of A(H5) virus infections were reported, including those involving health care workers, but without evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission. Available epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that A(H5N1) viruses have not acquired the ability to sustain transmission among humans. Therefore, the likelihood of sustained human-to-human spread is low. Based on available information so far, WHO assesses the risk to the general population posed by this virus to be low.\u00a0The risk assessment will be reviewed as needed if additional information becomes available.\u00a0 Close analysis of the epidemiological situation, further characterization of the most recent influenza A(H5N1) viruses in both human and poultry populations, and serological investigations are critical to assess associated risks to public health and promptly adjust risk management measures. There are no specific vaccines for influenza A(H5N1) in humans. However, candidate vaccines to prevent influenza A(H5) infection in humans have been developed for pandemic preparedness in some countries. WHO continues to update the\u00a0list of zoonotic influenza candidate vaccine viruses (CVV) selected twice a year at the WHO consultation on influenza virus vaccine composition. The list of such CVV is available on WHO website. In addition, the genetic and antigenic characterization of contemporary zoonotic influenza viruses are published on\u00a0the Global influenza programme, human-animal interface website.",
        "WHO Advice": "This event does not change the current WHO recommendations on influenza surveillance and public health measures. Given reports of sporadic influenza A (H5N1) cases in humans, outbreaks in mammals, the widespread circulation in birds and the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect and monitor virological, epidemiological, and clinical changes associated with emerging or circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health and timely virus sharing for risk assessment.The public should avoid contact with high-risk environments such as live animal markets/farms and live poultry, or surfaces that might be contaminated by poultry droppings. Additionally, it is recommended to maintain good hand hygiene with frequent washing or the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer.The general public and at-risk individuals should immediately report instances of sick or unexpected deaths in animals to veterinary authorities. Consumption of poultry or wild birds that are sick or have died unexpectedly should be avoided.Any person who has had exposure to potentially infected birds or contaminated environments and feels unwell, should seek health care promptly and inform their healthcare provider of their possible exposure. WHO advises against implementing any travel or trade restrictions based on the current information available on this event. WHO does not advise special traveler screening at points of entry or other restrictions due to the current situation of influenza viruses at the human-animal interface.State Parties to the International Health Regulations (2005) are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by a new subtype of influenza virus. Evidence of illness is not required for this notification.",

        "Outbreak name": "Upsurge of respiratory illnesses among children",
        "Date Reported": "23 November 2023",
        "Location": "Northern China",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "Since mid-October 2023, the World Health Organization (WHO) has been monitoring data from Chinese surveillance systems that have been showing an increase in respiratory illness in children in northern China.At a press conference on 13 November 2023, China\u2019s National Health Commission reported on a nationwide increase in the incidence of respiratory diseases, predominantly affecting children. Chinese authorities attributed this increase to lifting of COVID-19 restrictions and the arrival of the cold season, and due to circulating known pathogens such as influenza, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Mycoplasma pneumonia and RSV are known to affect children more than adults. On 22 November 2023, WHO identified media and ProMED reports about clusters of undiagnosed pneumonia in children's hospitals in Beijing, Liaoning and other places in China. Through the International Health Regulations mechanism, WHO made an official request to China to provide additional epidemiologic and clinical information, as well as laboratory results from these reported cases and data about recent trends in circulating respiratory pathogens. A key purpose was to identify whether there have been \u201cclusters of undiagnosed pneumonia\u201d in Beijing and Liaoning as referred to in media reports, and if so whether these were separate events, or part of the known general increase in respiratory illnesses in the community. WHO further reached out through clinical networks for additional information.On 23 November, WHO held a teleconference with Chinese health authorities from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the Beijing Children\u2019s Hospital, facilitated by the National Health Commission and the National Administration of Disease Control and Prevention, in which the requested data were provided, indicating an increase in outpatient consultations and hospital admissions of children due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia since May, and RSV, adenovirus and influenza virus since October. Some of these increases are earlier in the season than historically experienced, but not unexpected given the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions, as similarly experienced in other countries. No changes in the disease presentation were reported by the Chinese health authorities. Chinese authorities advised that there has been no detection of any unusual or novel pathogens or unusual clinical presentations, including in Beijing and Liaoning, but only the aforementioned general increase in respiratory illnesses due to multiple known pathogens. They further stated that the rise in respiratory illness has not resulted in patient loads exceeding hospital capacities.The Chinese authorities advised that, since mid-October, enhanced outpatient and inpatient surveillance has been implemented for respiratory illnesses covering a broad spectrum of viruses and bacteria, including, for the first time, Mycoplasma pneumoniae. This complements existing respiratory surveillance mechanisms and may have contributed to the observed increase in detection and reporting of respiratory illness in children.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "Since mid-October, in addition to enhancing disease surveillance in health care facilities and community settings, Chinese authorities have stressed the need to strengthen the capacity of the health system to manage patients. China has systems in place to capture information on trends in influenza, influenza-like illness (ILI), RSV and SARS-CoV-2, pneumonia and other severe acute respiratory infections (SARI), and reports influenza detections to platforms such as the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS). GISRS is led by WHO and used for the international virological and epidemiological surveillance of human influenza.WHO is closely monitoring the situation and is in close contact with national authorities in China. WHO will continue to provide updates as warranted.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "In the current outbreak of respiratory illness, the reported symptoms are common to several respiratory diseases and, as of now, at the present time, Chinese surveillance and hospital systems report that the clinical manifestations are caused by known pathogens in circulation. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common respiratory pathogen and a common cause of paediatric pneumonia, and is readily treated with antibiotics.China has an influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) sentinel surveillance system. Since mid-October, China has implemented enhanced surveillance systems for respiratory illness covering a broad spectrum of respiratory viruses and bacteria, including Mycoplasma pneumoniae.There is limited detailed information available to fully characterize the overall risk of these reported cases of respiratory illness in children. However, due to the arrival of the winter season, the increasing trend in respiratory illnesses is expected; co-circulation of respiratory viruses may increase burden on health care facilities.According to surveillance data reported to WHO\u2019s FluNet and published by the National Influenza Centre in China, ILI was above usual levels for this time of year and increasing in the northern provinces. Influenza detections were predominantly A(H3N2) and B/Victoria lineage viruses.",
        "WHO Advice": "Based on the available information, WHO recommends that people in China follow measures to reduce the risk of respiratory illness, which include recommended vaccines against influenza, COVID-19 and other respiratory pathogens as appropriate; keeping distance from people who are ill; staying home when ill; getting tested and medical care as needed; wearing masks as appropriate; ensuring good ventilation; and practicing regular handwashing.WHO does not recommend any specific measures for travellers to China. In general, persons should avoid travel while experiencing symptoms suggestive of respiratory illness, if possible; in case of symptoms during or after travel, travellers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share travel history with their health care provider.WHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions based on the current information available on this event.",

        "Outbreak name": "Mpox (monkeypox)",
        "Date Reported": "23 November 2023",
        "Location": "Democratic Republic of the Congo",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "Mpox is an infectious disease caused by monkeypox virus (MPXV), which is endemic in densely forested regions of West, Central and East Africa, particularly in the northern and central regions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Eleven of the 26 provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo are identified as endemic for mpox, but in more recent years the total number of mpox cases and the number of provinces reporting mpox has been expanding, to 22 provinces as of November 2023. There are two known clades of MPXV: clade I, previously known as the Congo Basin clade; and clade II, previously called the West African clade; clade II further has two subclades: clade IIa and clade IIb. Before 2018, very few cases were reported outside of the African continent: eight international travellers returning from endemic countries and one outbreak related to imported animals. Since 2022, an epidemic of clade IIb MPXV has been ongoing globally, affecting many countries outside the African continent that had never reported mpox previously. The spread of this epidemic was mainly driven by transmission via sexual contact among men who have sex with men. The Democratic Republic of the Congo has not reported cases of mpox linked to clade IIb MPXV during the global outbreak to date; only MPXV clade I has been detected in the country. Before April 2023, no formally documented cases of sexual transmission of clade I MPXV were registered globally. The first known cases were reported when a man, resident in Belgium and with connections to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, tested positive for clade I in Kenge, Kwango province, during a visit to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Thereafter, sexual contacts of this case in the Democratic Republic of the Congo also tested positive for clade I MPXV, with closely related viral sequences. This is the first time that reported clade I MPXV infection is linked to sexual transmission within a cluster. Another outbreak in the country is also being reported with multiple cases of mpox among sex workers. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, human-to-human transmission of mpox through close contact has been reported since the 1970s, mostly in small household or community outbreaks, presumed to be primarily due to zoonotic transmission. Due to a lack of timely access to diagnostics, difficulties with linking cases to any contact with infectious animals, and incomplete epidemiological and contact tracing investigations over the years, the dynamics of MPXV clade I transmission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are not well understood. These new features of sexual and unknown modes of transmission now raise additional concerns over the continuing rapid expansion of the outbreak in the country. In the global outbreak of mpox which began in 2022, clade IIb MPXV transmission between humans continues in most WHO regions. In addition, clade I MPXV community outbreaks occur regularly in three countries (Cameroon, Central African Republic, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo) and sporadically in others (e.g., Sudan, South Sudan). In some of these geographic areas in East, West and Central Africa, transmission from animals to humans is also presumed to occur. The natural reservoir of the virus is unknown; while various small mammals such as squirrels and monkeys are known to be susceptible, they have rarely been linked to outbreaks.",
        "Description of the Situation": "From 1 January through 12 November 2023, a total of 12 569 suspected mpox cases, including 581 suspected mpox deaths (case fatality ratio: 4.6%), have been reported in 156 health zones from 22 out of 26 (85%) provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. This is the highest number of annual cases ever reported, with new cases in geographic areas that had previously not reported mpox, including Kinshasa, Lualaba, and South Kivu. Among suspected cases, 1106 were tested by real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and 714 were positive for MPXV (positivity rate of 65%). Cases with travel history to endemic provinces have been driving chains of human-to-human transmission in non-affected provinces (Figure 1 & 2).Figure 1: Geographic distribution of suspected mpox cases by province, Democratic Republic of the Congo, 1 January \u2013 4 November 2023 (Epi weeks 1 to 44) Figure 2: Geographic distribution of confirmed mpox cases by province, Democratic Republic of the Congo, 1 January \u2013 7 October 2023 (epi weeks 1 to 40)First cases of sexually transmitted clade I MPXV:\u00a0The first cluster of suspected cases of sexually transmitted mpox was identified in Kenge, Kwango province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It included six confirmed cases, five men and one woman, with no deaths among the confirmed cases. The first known case is a man, resident of Belgium with connections to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who arrived in Kinshasa, on 15 March 2023 and started experiencing anal itching and discomfort the same day. On 16 March 2023, one day after arrival from Belgium, he travelled to the town of Kenge (260 km from Kinshasa). On 17 March, his anal lesion and genitals became painful blisters, and he developed further skin lesions on the trunk and buttocks. On 23 March, he consulted a doctor who suspected mpox, and a blood sample, oropharyngeal, rectal and vesicle swabs were performed on 24 March.\u00a0The patient tested positive by RT-PCR of biological samples at the National Institute of Biomedical Research (INRB) in Kinshasa and the result was shared with the Ministry of Health on 10 April. Genomic sequencing of the sample confirmed that it was clade I MPXV.\u00a0The individual\nidentified himself as a man who has sexual relations with other men. During his\ntravel in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, he visited discretely operating\nknown clubs of men who have sex with men and had several sexual contacts. He\nshowed symptoms on the day of his arrival in the country, and with the mpox\nincubation period most often being more than one day, available information\nsuggests that exposure took place outside the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nNonetheless, genetic analysis of the virus confirmed infection with a clade I\nstrain, similar to other strains circulating in the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo. Although the patient had no reported exposure to another person with\nconfirmed mpox, based on the epidemiological investigation exposure to mpox likely\noccurred in Belgium.\u00a0Epidemiological investigation following this first case identified several sexual and non-sexual contacts who were monitored over time for mpox signs and symptoms.\u00a0 Among 27 contacts identified and six tested, five sexual contacts tested positive for mpox: two were confirmed on 10 April and three on 18 April. Of these five contacts, three developed symptoms during their 21-day follow-up period. Two contacts who did not develop symptoms also tested positive by a mucous membrane sample. Of the five confirmed contact cases, four were men aged between 24 and 35 years old and one was a woman. The initial case confirmed having sexual contact with each of them. After his recovery from mpox he returned to Belgium on 5 May 2023.\u00a0This cluster of mpox cases represents the first documented sexual\ntransmission of MPXV Clade I. It is also the first described transmission of\nMPXV Clade I among men who have sex with men. Notably, there are clubs in Kenge\nfor men who have sex with men, some of whose members travel to visit other\nclubs within the country and outside the country, particularly in Europe and within\nCentral Africa. In the city of Kinshasa, there are more than 50 such clubs.\nSome members of these clubs also reside outside the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo. This event is unusual and highlights the risk that MPXV clade I could also\nwidely spread among sexual networks, as seen for clade II during the 2022-23\nglobal outbreak.\u00a0On 28 July 2023, another confirmed case of mpox was recorded in another man who had sex with men in Kenge town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The patient was a man residing in Kenge, with onset of the disease on 11 June 2023. He was not listed among the contacts of the first group of cases and the limited epidemiological investigation did not directly link him to the March-April cluster. Genome sequencing for this case has not been performed.\u00a0Further epidemiological investigations are being conducted to verify reports of new cases in this province. First mpox outbreak in KinshasaIn August 2023, for the first time, mpox cases were confirmed in Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Four separate events were identified where persons exposed in other provinces (Equateur, Maindombe) travelled to Kinshasa, each leading to local transmission with small clusters in the capital. Between 18 August and 12 November 2023, a total of 102 suspected cases were reported in eight health zones in Kinshasa, including 18 confirmed cases with one confirmed mpox death (case fatality ratio of 5.6% among confirmed cases).\u00a0The first confirmed case was in a person who arrived from the Maindombe province, where mpox is endemic, to Kinshasa by river boat. He was confirmed on August 18 and subsequently several of his close contacts developed symptoms and tested positive for MPXV. Additional imported confirmed cases were reported in Limete, Makala and Nsele health zones. The sex ratio among confirmed cases in Kinshasa is men 2: women 1, with a median age of 24 (95% CI 11-27) years.\u00a0 For the moment, 13 of the confirmed cases have recovered (including a health worker), one died and four are isolated and under treatment. The person who died also had tuberculosis and acquired mpox during hospitalization, indicating nosocomial transmission. \u00a0These new reports of human-to-human transmission of mpox in a large urban area such as Kinshasa clearly illustrate that the epidemiology of mpox in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is changing.\u00a0\u00a0First mpox outbreak in South KivuBefore 2023, South Kivu province had not reported mpox. The first confirmed case was a young trader who travelled from Kisangani, in Tshopo province, one of the mpox endemic provinces, a few days before the onset of symptoms on 26 September 2023. The first skin lesions were located on his genitals and later extended to the whole body. During the initial epidemiological investigation, 113 contacts were registered in Bukavu and Kamituga health zones. As of 22 November 2023, a total of 80 suspected and 34 confirmed cases (including 20 sex workers) of mpox have been reported in South Kivu mainly from the Kamituga health zone, with no deaths. Currently South Kivu province is grappling with conflict, displacement, food insecurity, and challenges in providing adequate humanitarian assistance, all of which have a profound impact on the local population, especially vulnerable groups, and might represent fertile ground for further spread of mpox.\u00a0Animal studiesThe natural reservoir of the monkeypox virus is unknown \u2013 various small mammals such as squirrels and monkeys can be infected, and non-human primates are known to be clinically susceptible. Over the decades, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and partners have carried out animal studies to better characterize the ecology of the virus and potential animal reservoirs or incidental hosts. Such studies have been carried out in the provinces of Equateur, Haut U\u00e9l\u00e9, Kwango, Kwilu, Ma\u00efndombe, Maniema, Sankuru, Sud Ubangi, Tshopo, and Tshuapa. Eco-epidemiolocal studies are ongoing with national and international research partners collaborating to determine reservoir and incidental hosts.",
        "Epidemiology": "Mpox (monkeypox) is an infectious disease caused by the monkeypox virus (MPXV). There are two known clades of MPXV: clade I, previously called the Congo Basin clade; and clade II, previously called the West Africa clade; clade II further has two subclades: clade IIa and clade IIb. The disease is caused by one of the two clades of MPXV transmitted between humans through close contact with lesions, body fluids, respiratory droplets or contaminated materials, or from animals to humans through contact with live animals or consumption of contaminated bushmeat.The incubation period ranges from two to 21 days, although some people can acquire infection without developing symptoms. Typically for mpox, fever, muscle aches and sore throat appear first, followed by skin and mucosal rash. Typically, the rash evolves over 2-4 weeks in stages \u2013 macules, papules, vesicles, pustules. Lesions dip in the centre before crusting over. Scabs then fall off. Lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes) is also a typical feature of mpox, present in most cases. \u00a0Children, pregnant people and people with weak immune systems are at risk for complications and death from mpox.Identifying mpox can be difficult as other infections and conditions can look similar. It is important to distinguish mpox from chickenpox, measles, bacterial skin infections, scabies, herpes, syphilis, other sexually transmissible infections, and medication-associated allergies. Someone with mpox may also concurrently have another sexually transmissible infection such as herpes. Alternatively, a child or adult with suspected mpox may also have chickenpox. For these reasons, testing is key for people to get treatment as early as possible and to prevent further spread. Detection of viral DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the preferred laboratory test for mpox. The best diagnostic specimens are taken directly from the rash \u2013 skin, fluid or crusts \u2013 collected by vigorous swabbing. In the absence of skin lesions, testing can be done on oropharyngeal, anal or rectal swabs. However, while a positive result of oropharyngeal, anal or rectal sample is indicative of mpox, a negative result is not enough to exclude MPXV infection. Testing of blood is not recommended. Antibody detection methods may be used for retrospective case classification, but not diagnosis. It needs to be restricted to reference laboratories and it may not be useful as often it does not distinguish between different orthopoxviruses. Treatment is based on taking care of the rash, managing pain, and preventing complications. In addition, specific antiviral medications such as tecovirimat can also be used in the treatment of mpox, particularly for severe cases or individuals at higher risk of complications. In the context of the global outbreak of mpox which began in 2022 (caused mostly by Clade IIb virus), the presentation of mpox varied, with some cases showing a rash appearing before or simultaneously with other symptoms, and the initial lesions were often localized on genitals and mucosae such as the mouth. For the first time the spread of MPXV has been driven and sustained by sexual contact among men who have sex with men who are members of large sexual networks.",
        "Public Health Response": "Emergency coordination:\u00a0The Ministry of Public Health, Hygiene and Prevention prepared a budgeted national mpox preparedness and response plan. Further to this plan, an mpox Emergency Operations Centre and Incident Management Team were inaugurated in February 2023 to implement the following actions: \u00a0Monitoring and detection:\u00a0Strengthening surveillance of mpox throughout the country and particularly in Kinshasa, Kenge and Kamituga.\u00a0Distribution of sample collection and transport kits to reference hospitals and logistical support for collecting, transporting, and examining samples from suspected cases in Kenge, Kinshasa and other affected areas.Capacity building of health care providers and professionals in mpox surveillance, including detection of sexual transmission and other possible modes of transmission.\u00a0Monitoring of contacts of clinical and laboratory-confirmed cases for a period of 21 days.\u00a0Genetic sequencing of MPXV samples to better understand the circulating viral strain(s).\u00a0\u00a0Communication and awareness:\u00a0Information campaign on the risks of mpox and other sexually transmitted infections to groups potentially at risk, specifically targeting members of sex-clubs in Kenge and elsewhere.\u00a0Identification and engagement of other clubs and populations potentially at risk.\u00a0Establishment of a call center to facilitate alerts reporting and promote communication between health authorities and the communities concerned.\u00a0\u00a0Case management and infection prevention and control:Supply of personal protective equipment to health professionals in Kenge, Kinshasa, Kamituga Maindombe and Tshopo.\u00a0Isolation of confirmed cases in hospital or at home to prevent further transmission.Adapted clinical care, including psychological support, for persons with mpox.\u00a0\u00a0Training and capacity:Training of laboratory workers from Kamituga, Kenge, Kinshasa and any other affected city or province on the collection, conservation, and appropriate delivery of mpox samples.\u00a0Raising awareness among health authorities and health care providers across the country about mpox and its management.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "From 1 January to 12 November 2023, there has been a two-fold increase in the number of suspected mpox cases with 12 569 suspected cases reported, compared to 6216 in 2020, the highest annual number previously reported. Mpox has also been reported in new geographic areas such as Kinshasa, Kwango province and South Kivu. The reasons for this expansion, affecting men, women and children, remain unknown. Although increased awareness of the global mpox epidemic due to clade IIb MPXV has helped improve surveillance in the country, many aspects of the current situation remain to be elucidated.\u00a0Transmission of mpox through sexual contact enables faster spread from one person to another due to direct contact of mucous membranes, possibly leading to a shorter average incubation period. Immunocompromised individuals, either due to uncontrolled HIV or other immunocompromising conditions, are at higher risk for severe mpox complications and mpox-related death. \u00a0While national HIV prevalence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is estimated to be <1%, it is estimated to be 7.1% among men who have sex with men. Overall, an estimated 17% of people living with HIV in the country do not know their status, putting them at risk of developing advanced HIV infection, compromised immunity, and severe mpox disease. The detection of clade I MPXV among visitors to a club of men who have sex with men in Kenge, some of whose members travel to visit other clubs within and outside the country, particularly in central Africa and in Europe, represents a risk for men who have sex with men in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and internationally. In the city of Kinshasa, it is estimated that there are over 50 similar clubs, and some of their members reside outside the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\u00a0It is still unclear what proportion of mpox cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo may be exposed through sexual contact; however, with outbreaks linked to sexual transmission documented in 2023 in three previously unaffected provinces, the potential additional public health impact of this new observation could be significant, particularly in under-resourced urban areas. The rapid evolution of the new outbreak in South Kivu, including among sex workers, is also concerning.Additionally, the first case identified in Kinshasa had traveled to the city by boat on the Congo river. These boats constitute a potentially high exposure environment since people are often in proximity, transporting animals, selling and consuming wild game on board, and often traveling on the boats for weeks while sharing beds and sometimes engaging in sexual activities.\u00a0Moreover, the human-to-human spread potential is amplified in urban settings such as Kinshasa and the implementation of containment measures is more challenging.Response capacities for mpox remain limited in the country. Surveillance and laboratory capacities remain suboptimal: only 9% (1106 / 12 569, as of week 44) of suspected cases this year have been tested by PCR. There are no immunization programmes for populations at risk of mpox in the Democratic Republic of the Congo outside of research projects, and access to the antiviral medication tecovirimat also remains limited to a few clinical research studies in the country. Risk communication and community engagement are therefore of critical importance to address the risk posed by modes of transmission traditionally reported as bushmeat consumption and community outbreaks, as well as for the newly described risk of sexual transmission, particularly among men who have sex with men. According to a recent WHO study, awareness of the risks associated with mpox is low in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\u00a0Additionally, anyone suffering from disfiguring skin conditions, including due to mpox, may face stigma, and the lack of health messages to date for men who have sex with men in the country exposes this population to a particular risk.\u00a0In summary, the reasons for concern about further spread of mpox in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are as follows: The Democratic Republic of the Congo is experiencing a significant increase in the number of suspected cases reported in 2023; \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Geographic expansion of the presence of mpox is underway in the newly affected southern and eastern provinces of the country; Epidemiological and scientific knowledge about mpox remains limited and modes of transmission in the country are poorly understood;In 2023, confirmed cases of mpox have been reported in the large urban area of \u200b\u200bKinshasa and several other previously unaffected areas for the first time;Sexual transmission of mpox due to clade I MPXV is being documented for the first time and chains of transmission may have been missed;Key populations experience a higher prevalence of HIV infection than the general population;Awareness of mpox and the associated risks are insufficient in the general and key populations;National response capacities face challenges, including limited epidemiological information on exposure and infection risk factors, limited public awareness of mpox and prevention measures, and numerous competing priorities;Collaboration and coordination among partners are needed to sustain essential research and support a robust response at national as well as provincial and local levels.\u00a0The risk of mpox further spreading to neighbouring countries and worldwide appears to be significant. In addition to the features outlined above, arguments supporting the assessment of a high risk of international spread of mpox include the following:\u00a0These first reported outbreaks of mpox due to clade I MPXV linked to sexual contact include a history of international travel within and across WHO regions;The introduction of clade I MPXV in different and possibly intersecting sexual networks could facilitate and amplify the spread of this historically more virulent clade of the virus;A concurrent outbreak of mpox is occurring in the neighbouring Republic of Congo along the Congo River ecosystem, whose links, if any, with cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo remain unknown.These factors pose an additional risk of mpox outbreaks with potentially more severe consequences than the one which has been affecting the world since 2022.",
        "WHO Advice": "All countries, including their health authorities and clinicians/healthcare workers, should take note that the global mpox outbreak is ongoing; and, furthermore, the occurrence of sexual transmission of the clade I virus has been confirmed. Infection with clade I MPXV may lead to an increased risk of severe illness.\u00a0It is therefore strongly advised that countries continue to follow the Standing Recommendations of the Director-General of the WHO issued in August 2023, particularly concerning the epidemiological surveillance of mpox, strengthening of laboratory diagnostic capacities and genomic sequencing of viruses, community engagement and risk communication, making vaccines available, optimal case management, strengthening research to better understand modes of transmission in different contexts, and sustained support for the development of rapid diagnostic methods and treatments tailored to the needs of patients.\u00a0In all settings, it is essential to emphasize the importance of case investigation with sensitivity and absence of stigma and in-depth understanding of human-to-human transmission of mpox in communities, while strengthening the One Health approach in areas where the monkeypox virus circulates in possible mammalian hosts or reservoirs.\u00a0It is essential to deepen knowledge in different contexts about the links between mpox and HIV infection, their respective and common risk factors, to provide a population specific health service, and to integrate surveillance and case management within a strengthened and agile health service which meets patient needs.\u00a0Actions in the communityCommunication on the risks of sexual transmission of mpox must be strengthened, especially among the people most at risk and individuals and households affected by this disease. Advocacy must be done at all levels to support, inform and engage community leaders in implementing the necessary measures to inform and engage their communities about mpox and how to stop its spread.\u00a0Risk communication and community engagement activities will be vital in motivating affected communities to become aware of the risks and locally relevant protective behaviours. Socio-behavioural data should be collected, and a situation analysis should be carried out to better understand transmission and risk factors. This information can then be used to improve decision-making, to ensure response efforts are aligned with community needs, priorities and capacities, and to inform the development of risk communications plans and evidence-based community engagement. Key audiences should be identified, including health professionals, men who have sex with men, people working at or attending venues and events where sexual activity takes place, sex workers, and people at risk of more serious illness (including those whose HIV is not treated or adequately controlled). Partnerships should be established with trusted networks working with these communities to facilitate community engagement. Two-way feedback systems should be established or activated. Particular attention should be paid to measures to understand, prevent and combat stigma and discrimination \u2013 these are never acceptable and can undermine the response to the epidemic and have a serious impact on health outcomes.\u00a0Concerning the health facility, points of entry and control Infection prevention and control measures in community venues and health centers are necessary to prevent and respond to outbreaks of mpox. It is important to train staff on the risks linked to contamination, to provide protective equipment, hand washing and hygiene devices in hospitals and at entry/control points; and ensuring appropriate patient isolation is in place. Health care professionals caring for patients with suspected or confirmed mpox infection should take \u201cstandard,\u201d \u201ccontact,\u201d and \u201cdroplet\u201d precautions. While protecting themselves with recommended measures, healthcare workers should also ensure that stigmatization of patients with mpox is avoided, and that psychological support is provided to patients and their families.\u00a0WHO advises against any travel or trade restrictions for the current outbreak.\u00a0When collecting clinical and laboratory specimens Specimens collected from persons and animals suspected of being infected with MPXV should be handled by trained personnel working in equipped laboratories. Confirmation of monkeypox virus depends on the type and quality of the sample, and the type of laboratory test. Thus, specimens must be packaged and shipped in accordance with national and international requirements. RT-PCR is the preferred laboratory test, given its accuracy and sensitivity. For this, the optimal diagnostic samples for MPXV should be taken from skin or mucosal lesions - fluid from vesicles and pustules, and dry scabs. PCR blood tests are generally inconclusive due to the short duration of viremia compared to the time of sample collection after the onset of symptoms; they should not be systematically collected from patients. Because orthopoxviruses are serologically cross-reactive, antigen and antibody detection methods are not sufficiently specific for MPXV and do not constitute a formal confirmatory diagnosis. It is therefore essential that laboratories support health authorities in providing specimen collection kits for skin or mucosal lesions.\u00a0Preventive measures\u00a0\u00a0Anyone with a clinical or laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of mpox should follow the instructions of health authorities according to the local context, including isolation during the infectious period whenever feasible. Contacts of a confirmed case should be monitored or should self-monitor for any sign or symptom, practice hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette, avoid contact with immunocompromised individuals, children, or pregnant women, and avoid sexual contact and non-essential travel for a period of 21 days from the last contact with a person with mpox.Vaccines and antiviral treatmentsVaccines for the prevention of mpox are composed of vaccinia virus and were first developed as safer vaccines for the purpose of smallpox preparedness: third-generation vaccines causing fewer side effects than the vaccines used during smallpox eradication are available. These include MVA-BN, first approved for the prevention of mpox in 2019 and the LC16-KMB vaccine approved for mpox in 2022. These vaccines offer 66-90% protection against mpox due to the antigenic similarity of the viruses that cause smallpox and mpox. A few countries maintain stocks of vaccines against smallpox and mpox, especially since the start of the global outbreak in 2022. Vaccination against mpox is recommended for persons at risk of contracting the disease, including children, and persons who have been in close contact with someone who has mpox.\u00a0Antivirals are also being developed and a clinical trial of the antiviral agent tecovirimat is ongoing in the the Democratic Republic of the Congo in two district hospitals in the provinces of Maniema & Sankuru.\u00a0 In order to access tecovirimat in the country, a request can be made to national health authorities.",

        "Outbreak name": "Diphtheria",
        "Date Reported": "18 October 2023",
        "Location": "Guinea",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 5 September 2023, the Ministry of Health notified WHO of a diphtheria outbreak in Guinea. From 4 July to 13 October 2023, a total of 538 cases of diphtheria, were reported in the Kankan region, in the east-central part of Guinea. Of the total cases reported, 520 are suspected and 18 confirmed with 58 deaths including 13 among confirmed cases (case fatality rate (CFR) among all cases, 11%). The 1-4 years age group accounted for the largest proportion of reported cases.\nDiphtheria is a highly contagious vaccine-preventable disease caused mainly by the bacteria Corynebacterium diphtheriae which can be fatal in 5-10% of cases, with a higher mortality rate in young children. However, in settings with poor access to diphtheria antitoxin, the CFR can be as high as 40%.\nDiphtheria remains a significant health problem in countries with poor routine vaccination coverage. According to WHO/UNICEF estimates of national immunization coverage (WUENIC), the immunization coverage with the diphtheria tetanus toxoid and pertussis (DTP3) containing vaccine was reported to be 47% for 2022 in Guinea and has remained below 50% since 2014. This is insufficient for achieving the coverage of 80\u201385% required to maintain community protection. WHO assesses the risk of diphtheria to be high in Guinea, considering the chronically low vaccination coverage.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 5 September 2023, the Ministry of Health notified WHO of the current diphtheria outbreak in Guinea. On 4 July 2023, two children aged 2 and 4 years, attended the otolaryngology department of the Siguiri prefectural hospital in the Kankan region of Guinea, for similar symptoms (dyspnea, dysphasia, fever, cough). They were hospitalized for tonsillitis and respiratory infection and received antibiotic treatment before being referred to the Kankan regional hospital for additional care.Since 4 July and as of 13 October 2023, 538 cases have been reported, including 18 confirmed cases. In total, 58 deaths including 13 among confirmed cases were registered (case fatality rate (CFR) among all cases, 11%)., and 461 contacts are being followed up. Of the cases reported, 62% are female. The 1-4 years age group, with 445 cases, accounted for the largest proportion of reported cases, 82%, followed by the 5-9 years age group, with 5% and 5% for the 10 years and above age group. Children under the age of 12 months make up 7% of reported cases. None of the 538 cases were vaccinated.Kankan Region is divided into five prefectures and only the K\u00e9rouan\u00e9 prefecture has not reported any cases to date.The prefecture of Siguiri is the most affected, with 510 cases (95%). Of the 363 patients admitted to the treatment centers in Siguiri, 37 (10%) have died.Other prefectures reporting cases are Mandiana (13 cases), Kankan (13 cases) and Kouroussa (two cases).\u00a0 Of the 15 patients admitted in the treatment center in Kankan, 12 (80%) have died.The treatment centers in the country do not have the capacity in terms of human resources and material for adequate case management. Suspected and confirmed cases were treated with Amoxicillin and Azithromycin as first line therapy. Antibiotic prophylaxis (Amoxicillin, Azithromycin) was administered to the direct contacts.Figure 1: Distribution of diphtheria cases in Kankan region, Guinea, as of 13 October 2023\u00a0Figure 2: Suspected diphtheria cases by epidemiological week in Guinea, as of 13 October 2023",
        "Epidemiology": "Diphtheria is a highly contagious vaccine-preventable disease caused mainly by Corynebacterium diphtheria but also by Corynebacterium ulcerans. It spreads between people mainly by direct contact or through the air via respiratory droplets. The disease can affect all age groups; however, unimmunized children are most at risk. Symptoms often come on gradually, beginning with a sore throat and fever. In severe cases, the bacteria produce a poison (toxin) that causes a thick grey or white patch at the back of throat. This can block the airways, making it hard to breathe or swallow, and also creates a barking cough. The neck may swell in part due to enlarged lymph nodes.  Treatment involves administering diphtheria antitoxin (DAT) as well as antibiotics. Vaccination against diphtheria has been effective in reducing the mortality and morbidity from diphtheria dramatically. Diphtheria is fatal in 5-10% of cases, with a higher mortality rate in young children. However, in settings with poor access to DAT, the CFR can be as high as 40%.",
        "Public Health Response": "Guinea has strengthened epidemiological surveillance for early detection and case management.Daily coordination and monitoring meetings on the response activities are underway at the Regional level, led by the regional health inspector and with the support of WHO, MSF- Belgium and other partners in the region. Notification of all suspected cases of diphtheria, investigation initiation, and monitoring of contacts as soon as possible has been enhanced.Contact tracing, identification of an isolation zone at the Balato health post in the prefecture of Kouroussa and briefing of the healthcare workers on the case definition and prevention measures are ongoing. Case management activities such as antibiotic therapy (Amoxicillin, Azithromycin), treatment of suspected cases, antibiotic prophylaxis (Amoxicillin, Azithromycin) for the direct contacts and free case management at treatment centers with support from MSF are provided. Risk communication and community engagement efforts, such as raising awareness of cases in the community and identifying and briefing a communicator to raise awareness among parents of patients is ongoing.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Diphtheria is a vaccine-preventable disease caused by exotoxin-producing Corynebacterium diphtheriae, transmitted from person to person through close physical and respiratory contact. It can cause infection of the nasopharynx, which may lead to breathing difficulties and death. Diphtheria is fatal in 5 - 10% of cases, with a higher mortality rate in young children. Treatment involves administering diphtheria antitoxin as well as antibiotics. Vaccination against diphtheria has reduced the mortality and morbidity of diphtheria dramatically.The DAT supply is currently very constrained and insufficient to respond to current demands, as there is only a limited number of manufacturers and large outbreaks are being reported in different regions of the world.The risk of diphtheria in Guinea is considered high due to the low DTP3 vaccination coverage in the affected region (36% according to the survey coverage in households, 2023) and 47% national DTP3 vaccination coverage between 2014-2022 (per WHO/UNICEF estimates), and the risk at the regional level is moderate and low at the global level. The outbreak is also characterized by high case fatality among confirmed cases. Other factors include: the over population of the Siguiri health district, which is the epicenter of this outbreak, the weakened healthcare system and several concurrent epidemics in the area. The overpopulation of the Siguiri health prefecture, the epicenter of this epidemic, the insufficient poorly qualified health personnel, and the limited material resources of the health system weakens the response to this outbreak. In addition, the country is facing several concurrent epidemics in the area, such as pertussis, poliomyelitis, and rabies. Adding this to a context of extreme vulnerability due to mining activities, which induce significant population movement, reduce air quality, and increase the risk of natural disasters such as floods and landslides, impacting people\u2019s health.This emphasizes the urgent need to strengthen diphtheria vaccination coverage nationwide, especially in the epicenter and strengthen case management at hospital facilities dealing with diphtheria cases.",
        "WHO Advice": "The control of diphtheria is based on primary disease prevention by ensuring high population immunity through vaccination and secondary prevention of spread by the rapid investigation of close contacts to ensure prompt treatment of those infected.Epidemiological surveillance ensuring early detection of diphtheria outbreaks should be in place in all countries, and all countries should have access to laboratory facilities for reliable identification of toxigenic C. diphtheriae. Adequate quantities of diphtheria antitoxin should be available nationally or regionally for the medical management of cases.Vaccination is vital to preventing cases and outbreaks, and adequate clinical management involves administering diphtheria anti-toxin to neutralize the toxin and antibiotics reducing complications and mortality.WHO recommends early reporting and case management of suspected diphtheria cases to initiate the timely treatment of cases and follow-up of contacts and ensure the supply of diphtheria antitoxin.WHO advises implementing the following Infection Prevention & Control (IPC) measures in health care settings:At screening/triage, immediately place patients with symptoms of Upper Respiratory Tract Infection (URTI) in a separate area until examined, and, if a probable case, cohorted with patients with the same diagnosis. Keep the isolation area segregated from other patient-care areas.In addition to using standard precautions, patients with known or suspected respiratory diphtheria are placed under droplet precautions. Patients with known or suspected cutaneous diphtheria should be placed under contact precautions. Maintain one meter between patients. Keep patient care areas well- ventilated. Avoid patient movement or transport out of the isolation area. If movement is necessary out of the isolation area, have the patient use a medical mask and cover any wounds/lesions on the patient\u2019s body.Case management should be carried out following the WHO guidelines. In addition, high-risk populations such as young children under five years of age, school children, the elderly, close contact with diphtheria cases, and healthcare workers should be vaccinated on a priority basis. A coordinated response and community engagement can support further transmission and control of the ongoing outbreak. Prophylactic antibiotics (penicillin or erythromycin, dependent on the isolate antibiotic sensitivity) are indicated for close contacts for seven days. If the culture is positive for toxigenic Corynebacterium spp.., the contact should be treated as a case with an antibiotic course for two weeks (DAT is not needed for asymptomatic cases or cases without a pseudo membrane).Although travelers do not have a particular risk of diphtheria infection, it is recommended that national authorities remind travelers going to areas with diphtheria outbreaks to be appropriately vaccinated in accordance with the national vaccination scheme established in each country before travel. A booster dose is recommended if more than five years have passed since their last dose.WHO does not recommend that any general travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea based on the information available for this event.",

        "Date Reported": "16 October 2023",
        "Location": "Chad",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 15 August 2023, a dengue outbreak was declared by the Ministry of Public Health and Prevention in Chad. As of 1 October, there have been 1 342 suspected cases, including 41 confirmed cases reported across eight health districts in four provinces. Among the confirmed cases, one death was reported. Ab\u00e9ch\u00e9 health district in Ouadda\u00ef province, is the current epicentre of the outbreak.\nThe Ministry of Public Health and Prevention has initiated a number of key response activities by implementing, in collaboration with WHO and partners, the national contingency plan for dengue preparedness and response.\nDengue is a viral infection transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes. Many dengue infections produce only mild flu-like illness and over 80% of cases are asymptomatic. There is no specific treatment for dengue; however, timely detection of cases and appropriate case management are key elements of care to prevent severity and fatality of dengue.\nThis is the first dengue outbreak reported in Chad, and the country has limited surveillance, clinical and laboratory capabilities.\nGiven the favorable environmental conditions for mosquito spread, an ongoing humanitarian crisis due to a massive influx of refugees and returnees from Sudan and limited response capacities, WHO assesses the risk posed by this outbreak as high at the national level.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 15 August 2023, the Ministry of Public Health and Prevention of the Republic of Chad officially declared an outbreak of dengue in Ab\u00e9ch\u00e9 health district, Ouadda\u00ef province, in the east of the country, representing the first dengue outbreak ever reported in Chad.The declaration was made after the confirmation of dengue infection in eight out of 12 blood samples tested using real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) at the national Biosafety and Epidemics Laboratory (LaBiEp) in N'Djamena. Subsequently, the samples were sent to the Institut Pasteur in Cameroon for confirmation, which was completed on 22 August by PCR and ELISA, confirming the presence of dengue.As of 1 October, there have been 1 342 suspected cases, including 41 confirmed cases reported across eight health districts in four provinces. Among the confirmed cases, one death was reported (Case Fatality Ratio (CFR) among confirmed cases 2.4%).The dengue serotype responsible for this outbreak remains unknown.Eight districts in four provinces (NDjamena, Ouadda\u00ef, Sila, and Wadi Fira) have reported confirmed dengue cases. Notably, Ouadda\u00ef, the epicentre of the outbreak, has reported the highest number of confirmed cases, accounting for 31 out of the total 41 confirmed cases (76% of confirmed cases). The age group most affected by this outbreak are those between 15 to 34 years old, representing 27% of the reported confirmed cases.",
        "Epidemiology": "Dengue is a viral infection transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes and is found in tropical and sub-tropical climates worldwide, mostly in urban and semi-urban areas. The primary vectors that transmit the disease are Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and, to a lesser extent, Aedes albopictus.Dengue virus (DENV) has four serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4). Infection with one serotype provides long-term immunity to the homologous serotype but not to the other serotypes; sequential infections with a different serotype put people at greater risk for severe dengue. Many DENV infections produce only mild flu-like illness and over 80% of cases are asymptomatic.There is no specific treatment for dengue; however, the timely detection of cases, identifying any warning signs of severe dengue infection, and appropriate case management are key elements of care to lower the CFR during an outbreak to less than 1%.Although Chad has previously experienced outbreaks of arboviruses such as chikungunya and yellow fever, this is the first dengue outbreak ever reported in the country. Chad, including the Ouadda\u00ef province, experienced a chikungunya outbreak in 2020, with a total of 34 052 cases recorded and one associated death.",
        "Public Health Response": "The Ministry of Public Health and Prevention has initiated a number of key response activities, with the support of WHO and other partners, including:Mobilizing resources for the implementation of the national contingency plan for dengue preparedness and response, developed with WHO assistance.Strengthening surveillance and coordinating the response, including active case finding in healthcare facilities and the community and in-depth epidemiological investigations including regularly updating the case line list.Increasing early case detection capacity by disseminating community alert definition of cases and procuring rapid diagnostic tests (Bioline\u00a0 Dengue Duo (DENGUE NS1 Ag + IgG/IgM)) for health facilities.Ensuring effective logistics and operational support, including the transportation of samples for confirmation.Developing standard operating procedures (SOPs) for clinical management of suspected and confirmed dengue cases, including severe dengue and ensuring inventory of existing case management kits and address gaps.Strengthening cross-border collaboration and implementing prevention and vector control measures in border areas.Strengthening entomological surveillance, including aquatic and adult stages of the vectors, and characterizing vector bionomics.Implementing effective vector control measures as part of integrated vector management.Strengthening community mobilization and commitment to disseminate key information on transmission and control to the population.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "This is the first dengue outbreak reported in Chad, and the country lacks the necessary public health preparedness and response capacities.Community cases are likely underreported because dengue is unknown to the general public and clinicians are not yet sensitised to its presentation, which is sometimes confused with those of other common febrile infections, making early diagnosis challenging, particularly in settings with lack of laboratory facilities for testing.There is a high risk of spread due to the presence of mosquitoes in large, densely populated cities in eastern Chad near the Sudan border, with a tropical climate, and poor sanitation conditions suitable for mosquito development.The province of Ouadda\u00ef, which borders Sudan, is the epicentre of the outbreak and is also the province most affected by the ongoing humanitarian crisis due to a massive influx of refugees and returnees from Sudan. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the number of refugees in the Ouadda\u00ef province is currently more than 400 000.The movement of returning Sudanese refugees and Chadian nationals has the potential to spread the outbreak to new provinces and across the border.Based on the information available for this event, WHO assesses the risk posed by this outbreak as high at the national level, moderate at regional level, and low at global level.",
        "WHO Advice": "The proximity of mosquito breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for dengue virus infection. The prevention and control of dengue depend on effective vector control. Vector control activities should focus on all areas where there is a risk of human-vector contact (place of residence, workplaces, schools, and hospitals). WHO promotes a strategic approach known as Integrated Vector Management (IVM) to control Aedes species, the vector of dengue. IVM should be enhanced to remove potential breeding sites, reduce vector populations, and minimize individual exposure. This should involve vector control strategies for larvae and adults (i.e. environmental management and source reduction), especially of water storage practices, and include covering, draining and cleaning household water storage containers on a weekly basis, applying larvicide in non-potable waters using WHO-prequalified larvicides at correct dosages, distribution of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) for fever/dengue inpatients to contain spread of virus from health facilities, as well as strategies for protecting people and households. Indoor space spraying (fogging) is another approach for rapid containment of dengue-infected mosquitoes but may be challenging to deliver in densely populated areas of camps.Personal protective measures during outdoor activities include topical application of repellents to exposed skin or treatment of clothing, and wearing long-sleeved shirts and pants. Indoor protection can include household insecticide aerosol products, or mosquito coils. Window and door screens can reduce the probability of mosquitoes entering the house. Insecticide-treated nets offer good protection against mosquito bites while sleeping during the day. Since Aedes mosquitoes (the primary vector for transmission) are active at dawn and dusk, personal protective measures are recommended, particularly at these times of day, both in residential areas and also at places of work and schools for children.Entomological surveillance should be undertaken to assess the breeding potential of Aedes mosquitoes in containers and monitor insecticide resistance to help select the most effective insecticide-based interventions. There is no specific treatment for dengue infection, but early detection and access to appropriate healthcare for case management can reduce mortality. Case surveillance should continue to be enhanced in all affected areas and nationwide. Where feasible, resources should be allocated to strengthen a sample referral mechanism for the confirmation and sub-typing of the dengue virus.Communities play a major role in the success and sustainability of vector control activities. While coordination among many stakeholders is required, vector control is critically dependent on ensuring that communities are aware of the risk of infection and know which measures to take to protect themselves. Community engagement and mobilization involve working with local residents to improve vector control and build resilience against future disease outbreaks. Where appropriate participatory community-based approaches are in place, communities are supported to take responsibility for and implement vector control. Participatory community-based approaches aim to ensure that healthy behaviours become part of the social fabric and that communities take ownership of vector control at both inside and outside households.Based on the information available for this event, WHO does not recommend travel or trade restrictions be applied to Chad.",

        "Outbreak name": "Nipah virus infection",
        "Date Reported": "3 October 2023",
        "Location": "India",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "From the 12 to 15 September 2023, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, reported six laboratory-confirmed Nipah virus cases, including two deaths, in Kozhikode district, Kerala. Aside from the first case, whose source of infection is unknown, the other cases were family and hospital contacts of the first case. As of 27 September 2023,1288 contacts of the confirmed cases were traced, including high-risk contacts and healthcare workers, who are under quarantine and monitoring for 21 days. Since 12 September, 387 samples have been tested, of which six cases were positive for Nipah virus infection, and all remaining samples tested negative. Since 15 September, no new cases have been detected. This is the sixth outbreak of Nipah virus in India since 2001.\nNipah virus infection, a zoonotic illness, is spread to humans through contact with infected animals such as bats and pigs. Additionally, direct contact with an infected individual can also lead to transmission, although this route is less common. Those affected by Nipah virus infection may experience severe symptoms, including acute respiratory infection and fatal encephalitis. The only way to reduce or prevent infection in people is by raising awareness about the risk factors and preventive measures to protect themselves. Case management should focus on providing patients with supportive care measures and intensive support for severe respiratory and neurologic complications.\nState and national authorities activated a multisectoral coordination and response mechanism to contain the spread of the outbreak including enhanced surveillance and contact tracing, laboratory testing of suspected cases and high-risk contacts, hospital preparedness for case management, infection prevention and control (IPC), risk communication and community engagement.",
        "Description of the Situation": "Between 12 and 15 September 2023, a total of six laboratory-confirmed cases of Nipah virus infection including two deaths were reported by the State Government of Kerala. All confirmed cases were males within the age range of 9 to 45 years old and were reported within the Kozhikode district of Kerala.The first case whose source of infection is unknown, had pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and was admitted at a hospital in late August 2023. He died a few days after admission.\u00a0 The other five confirmed cases were close contacts of the first case including two family members and contacts at the hospital where the first case was treated and died. The second death occurred in an individual who accompanied another patient to the hospital where the first case was being treated. He died after presenting with symptoms of pneumonia.As of 27 September 2023, 1288 contacts of the confirmed cases have been traced, including high-risk contacts and healthcare workers who treated the confirmed cases and processed their samples. All identified contacts are under quarantine for a period of 21 days. As of 27 September 2023, the four cases remain clinically stable.The Government\u2019s response measures included declaring containment zones in nine villages in the Kozhikode district with movement restrictions, social distancing, and mandatory mask-wearing in public spaces. The government restricted major public events in Kozhikode district until 1 October 2023. Alerts were issued to neighbouring districts and states for enhanced surveillance.According to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, the virus found in Kerala has been identified as the Indian Genotype or I-Genotype and is similar to the Nipah virus strain found in Bangladesh.",
        "Epidemiology": "Nipah virus infection is an emerging bat-borne zoonotic disease transmitted to humans through infected animals (such as bats and pigs) or food contaminated with saliva, urine, and excreta of infected animals. It can also be transmitted directly from person to person through close contact with an infected person (although this represents a less common transmission route).Nipah virus infection in humans causes a range of clinical presentations including acute respiratory infection and fatal encephalitis. \u00a0The case-fatality rates in outbreaks across Bangladesh, India, Malaysia, and Singapore typically range from 40% to 100%. As of now, there are no available effective therapies or vaccines for this disease.The current outbreak is the third Nipah virus outbreak in Kozhikode district, Kerala, the fourth outbreak in Kerala state since 2018 and the sixth outbreak in India. Similar to the previous outbreak in 2018 in Kerala, this outbreak started with the first case and subsequent clustering of cases in family contacts and likely nosocomial transmission in hospitals. In the WHO South-East Asia Region, only Bangladesh and India have reported Nipah virus outbreaks.",
        "Public Health Response": "The following public health response measures were implemented by the Department of Health and Family Welfare, State Government of Kerala, with support from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, and its institutions; Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, and National Institute of Epidemiology, Chennai. Coordination: Multiple central multi-disciplinary teams were mobilized by the Department of Health & Family Welfare, Department of Health Research as well as Department of Animal Husbandry to support the State and District administration in containment and mitigation measures. A total of 19 core committees were created and tasked with various response measures including surveillance, sample testing, contact tracing, patient transportation, case management, logistics and supplies, training and capacity building, risk communication and community engagement, psychosocial support and animal husbandry. A control room with a call center was activated in the district to coordinate the response activities.Surveillance and contact tracing: As part of community-based surveillance activities, active house-to-house surveillance was carried out by the district health authorities in the containment zones declared. A total of 53,708 houses have been surveyed as of 27 September 2023. As of 27 September, 1288 contacts including high-risk contacts were identified and quarantine with follow up exercise ongoing. All high-risk contacts were tested. Containment zones were declared in nine villages in Kozhikode district with movement restrictions, social distancing and mandatory mask-wearing in public spaces. The government restricted major public events in Kozhikode district until 1 October 2023. Alerts have been issued to neighbouring districts and states for enhanced surveillance.Laboratory testing: Laboratory testing of suspected cases as well as environmental and animal samples is being conducted at the Regional Viral Research and Diagnostic Laboratory network lab at the Government Medical College (GMC), Kozhikode; Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) Mobile BSL-3 lab; Field unit of NIV at Alappuzha as well as NIV, Pune. As of 27 September 2023, no environmental/animal samples (including bats) have tested positive for Nipah virus.Health facility preparedness: Emergency departments have been equipped to handle any suspected cases and respond to emergencies. Isolation rooms and intensive care units (ICU) are being kept ready to treat suspected cases, where required. The State has earmarked isolation rooms, ICU beds, and ventilators to mount surge capacity when needed. Suspected and confirmed cases are being managed at designated health facilities. For patient transport, dedicated ambulances have been mobilized.Infection prevention and control: The State Government has initiated training of healthcare workers on infection prevention and control (IPC). Adequate stocks of Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs) have been made available to health care workers and IPC practices are being strictly adhered to and audited.Logistic management: Adequate stocks of PPEs, drugs and other requisite logistics are being provided by the State Government.Dead body management: Arrangement has also been made for the transfer and management of dead bodies by the State Government in compliance with the standard protocol and IPC precautions.Risk communication and community engagement: Information education and communication activities through different modalities (including regular press releases) have been initiated. Further, audio spots and video bytes by expert doctors are being issued. Infodemic management strategies are currently being implemented with strict action taken against fake news. A call center to provide psychosocial care has also been established by the State Government. Animal Sector: Samples of bats, animal droppings, and half-eaten fruits were collected on 15 September from the village where the first case lived, in a 300-acre (121-hectare) forest which is home to several bat species. All samples tested negative for Nipah virus.Public health response measures were implemented in accordance with the guidelines developed by the State Government and Government of India with support from WHO and partners during the 2018 Nipah virus outbreak in Kerala state.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "This is the sixth outbreak in India since 2001 when the first outbreak was reported in Siliguri town, West Bengal (66 cases, CFR: 68%). Subsequently, five outbreaks have been reported- Nadia district, West Bengal (5 cases; CFR: 100%), Kozhikode and Malappuram, Kerala in 2018 (23 cases including confirmed and probable; CFR: 91%), Ernakulum, Kerala in 2019 (a single case who survived) and Kozhikode, Kerala in 2021 (one case, CFR: 100%).The following factors may contribute to the risk associated with this outbreak:The exposure of the first case in this outbreak remains unknown;The presence of a bat population which has been reported to harbor Nipah virus and therefore acts as a potential source of infection;High reported case fatality rate (33.3%) and high number of contacts; andThe absence of Nipah virus-specific therapeutics and vaccines.At the same time, the current outbreak is not entirely unexpected and is the third outbreak in Kozhikode district and fourth in the state of Kerala. Current cases are clustered and epidemiologically linked to the first case, and cases are localized to Kozhikode district. Public health teams and health care workers in Kozhikode have prior experience in managing outbreaks of Nipah virus infection. The State Government has rapidly established response measures to contain the spread of the outbreak and through enhanced surveillance and contact tracing measures, 1288 contacts have been identified and are under monitoring. High-risk contacts are being tested.",
        "WHO Advice": "In the absence of a vaccine or licensed treatment available for Nipah virus, the only way to reduce or prevent infection in people is by raising awareness of the risk factors and educating people about the measures they can take to reduce exposure to Nipah virus infection. Case management should focus on the delivery of supportive care measures to patients. Intensive supportive care is recommended to treat severe respiratory and neurologic complications. Public health educational messages should focus on:Reducing the risk of bat-to-human transmissionFreshly collected date palm juice should be boiled, and fruits should be thoroughly washed and peeled before consumption. Fruits with signs of bat bites should be discarded. Areas where bats are known to roost should be avoided. The risk of international transmission via fruit or fruit products (such as raw date palm juice) contaminated with urine or saliva from infected fruit bats can be prevented by washing them thoroughly and peeling them before consumption.Reducing the risk of animal-to-human transmissionNatural infection in domestic animals has been described in farming pigs, horses, and domestic and feral cats. Gloves and other protective clothing should be worn while handling sick animals or their tissues and during slaughtering and culling procedures. As much as possible, people should avoid being in contact with infected pigs. In endemic areas, when establishing new pig farms, consideration should be given to the presence of fruit bats in the area and in general, pig feed and pig sheds should be protected against bats when feasible. Samples taken from animals with suspected Nipah virus infection should be handled by trained staff working in suitably equipped laboratories.Reducing the risk of human-to-human transmissionClose unprotected physical contact with Nipah virus infected people should be avoided. Regular hand washing should be carried out after caring for or visiting sick people. Health care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed infection, or those handling their specimens, including trained staff working in suitably equipped laboratories, should always implement infection prevention and control standard precautions as well as contact and droplet precautions when providing care or working in the rooms of patients with suspected or confirmed Nipah virus and when handling/managing linens or waste from patients with Nipah virus. Case management should focus on the delivery of supportive care measures to patients. Intensive supportive care is recommended to treat severe respiratory and neurologic complications.\u00a0 Safe burial practices are required for all confirmed and suspected Nipah virus infected cases.Infection prevention and controlIn health care settings, patients who are suspected of Nipah virus should be isolated in well-ventilated single rooms with dedicated patient equipment and toileting. Patients with suspected Nipah virus should not be placed in cohort rooms. Health care workers interacting with patients with Nipah virus should use contact and droplet precautions when caring for patients with Nipah virus. Contact, droplet, and airborne precautions should be used, including placement of a patient in an airborne isolation room when aerosol-generating medical procedures are performed. If airborne isolation rooms are not available, a well-ventilated single room with windows open if using natural ventilation with doors to corridors closed. Cleaning and disinfection of all surfaces in patient rooms housing suspected or confirmed patients with Nipah virus should occur at least once daily. After cleaning with soap and water, a 0.5% sodium hypochlorite solution disinfectant should be applied to surfaces, remaining untouched for 5 minutes contact time. Immediate cleaning and disinfection, as well as high touch surface cleaning, should be performed whenever a spill of blood or body fluid occurs.\u00a0 Health facilities should be equipped with enhanced water, sanitation and hygiene services to meet the needs of staff, patients and caregivers. Safe waste management practices should be adhered to by the health care facilities.WHO infection prevention and control advice when caring for patients with Nipah virus infection is currently under review and is pending update.WHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions on India based on the current information available on this event.",

Of these 15 cases, 10 have been hospitalised, with eight patients being admitted to an Intensive Care Unit. Fourteen out of the 15 cases are reported among foreign citizens identified from six countries in addition to France. These include Canada, Germany, Greece, Ireland, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the United States of America. All suspected cases consumed the same product (sardines in jars) on different dates at the same restaurant in Bordeaux during the week of 4\u201310 September 2023. The epidemiological investigations indicated that the source of infection is the consumption of homemade preserved sardines. The food item was produced and served at the restaurant.",
        "Epidemiology": "Botulism is a serious neurological condition\u00a0caused by a very potent toxin produced by the bacterium\u00a0\u00a0Clostridium botulinum\u00a0.\u00a0It develops particularly in poorly preserved foods. Human botulism may refer to foodborne botulism, infant botulism, wound botulism, and inhalation botulism or other types of intoxication.Foodborne botulism is a serious, potentially fatal disease. It is an intoxication caused by ingestion of potent neurotoxins\u2014the botulinum toxins\u2014formed in contaminated foods. Person-to-person transmission of botulism does not occur. The manifestations, or symptoms, of intoxication can vary, and \u00a0is characterized by descending, flaccid paralysis that can cause respiratory failure. Early symptoms include marked fatigue, weakness and vertigo, usually followed by blurred vision, dry mouth and difficulty in swallowing and speaking. Vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation and abdominal swelling may also occur. The disease can progress to weakness in the neck and arms, after which the respiratory muscles and muscles of the lower body are affected. There is no fever and no loss of consciousness. Symptoms usually appear from several hours up to 8 days following consumption of contaminated food.Although botulism outbreaks are relatively rare, they are considered public health emergencies that require rapid recognition to identify the disease source, distinguish outbreak types (between natural, accidental or deliberate), prevent additional cases and effectively administer treatment to affected patients. Successful treatment depends significantly on early diagnosis and the rapid administration of the botulinum antitoxin and intensive respiratory care.Incidence of botulism is low, but the mortality rate is high if prompt diagnosis and appropriate, immediate treatment is not given. The disease can be fatal in 5% to 10% of cases.",
        "Public Health Response": "On 11 September, food and serum samples were shipped to the French National Reference Center for Anaerobic Bacteria and Botulism, Institute Pasteur, Paris , and botulinum toxin was confirmed in serum samples and in a food sample (sardines) on 14 September 2023.\u00a0\u00a0The local health authorities inspected the restaurant and all products prepared by the restaurant have been recalled. On 13 September, the local health authorities held a press conference and informed the local healthcare professionals.The national health authorities have issued risk communication advice to sensitize the health care workers about the symptomatology and treatment.Information on cases reported among citizens from foreign countries have been shared with the relevant health authorities in those countries.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Local investigations have identified an estimated 25 persons through credit card receipts who have been exposed (i.e., who likely consumed the suspect food item). The exposure occurred at local level and measures have been implemented to eliminate the source of infection including the removal of the suspected food item, which was not distributed outside the venue. However, given the ranging incubation period of botulism\u2014up to eight days\u2014and that not all customers of the restaurant in Bordeaux may have been identified despite efforts, further cases linked to this event may still occur. This outbreak has occurred at the same time as the Rugby World Cup held from the week of 4 September 2023 attracting followers and rugby teams from all over the world.\u00a0Due to the incubation period up to eight days and the restaurant attracting international visitors, there is a possibility that additional cases among international visitors may be reported either from France or outside of France until 18 September.",
        "WHO Advice": "Prevention of foodborne botulism is based on good practice in food preparation particularly during heating/sterilization and hygiene. Foodborne botulism may be prevented by the inactivation of the bacterium and its spores in heat-sterilized (for example, retorted) or canned products, or by inhibiting bacterial growth and toxin production in other products. The vegetative forms of bacteria can be destroyed by boiling, but the spores can remain viable after boiling even for several hours. However, the spores can be killed by very high temperature treatments such as (commercial) canning.Commercial heat pasteurization (including vacuum packed pasteurized products and hot smoked products) may not be sufficient to kill all spores and therefore the safety of these products must be based on preventing bacterial growth and toxin production. Refrigeration temperatures combined with salt content and/or acidic conditions will prevent the growth of the bacteria and formation of toxin.The neurotoxins themselves are heat-labile and will be destroyed within minutes at temperatures above 80\u00b0C; consequently, only foods improperly processed in which the bacteria or the spores survive, pose a risk.The WHO five keys to safer food serve as the basis for educational programmes to train food handlers and educate the consumers. They are especially important in preventing food poisoning.The five keys are:keep cleanseparate raw and cookedcook thoroughlykeep food at safe temperaturesuse safe water and raw materials.",

Legionellosis, more commonly known as Legionnaires' disease, is a pneumonia-like illness, caused by a bacterium, that varies in severity from mild to a severe illness and sometimes fatal form of pneumonia.\nThis observed increase in confirmed cases, and associated hospitalizations and deaths seen since mid-August, is unusual, considering that the number of cases is higher than the annual number reported in Poland since 2016.\nPolish health authorities are coordinating cluster investigation activities, active case finding to identify additional cases, and public health activities to prevent transmission and limit the emergence of new cases, through preventive control measures. Since 7 September, no new cases have been reported, although the infection source has not yet been identified. Investigations are still ongoing to find the source of the outbreak.\nMost people develop Legionnaires' disease by inhaling the bacteria from water or soil. To date there has been no reported direct human-to-human transmission.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 18 August 2023, public health authorities in Rzesz\u00f3w, Poland, announced the detection of a cluster of 158 suspected community-acquired pneumonia cases, including 15 laboratory-confirmed cases of legionellosis among patients admitted to several hospitals in Rzesz\u00f3w.Between 18 August and 11 September 2023, a total of 166 laboratory-confirmed cases, all hospitalized, and 23 associated deaths (CFR of 14%) have been reported. Most cases, 67% (n=112), were recorded in the city of Rzesz\u00f3w, 23% (n=38) of cases in Rzesz\u00f3w county, and 10% (n=16) cases in other locations. Figure 1: Geographic distribution of confirmed Legionellosis cases in Poland between 18 August and 11 September 2023.Preliminary results from an ongoing epidemiological investigation indicate that the first cases developed symptoms on 30 July, while most cases developed symptoms between 12-16 August. Adults between 60 and 90 years are the most affected age group. The most recently reported case has an onset date of 29 August. All 23 related deaths had underlying comorbidities and were between the ages of 53 and 98 (11 females and 12 males).Figure 2: Number of confirmed Legionellosis cases reported in Rzeszow by Epidemic weekLaboratory resultsOnly hospitalized cases are tested for\u00a0Legionella spp. The majority of the cases were confirmed through urine antigen tests and 11 cases were confirmed through respiratory samples by PCR. Culture and sequencing were not possible as the cases were treated with antibiotics.Between 18 August to 11 September 2023, a total of 379 facility inspections were carried out. A total of 222 samples of hot and cold water were taken and investigations are ongoing.",
        "Epidemiology": "Legionellosis is an infection caused by Legionella bacteria. The\u00a0Legionella\u00a0bacteria can cause a mild illness, Pontiac fever, non-pneumonic form of the disease, and Legionnaires\u2019 disease, a severe pneumonia form of illness that can be fatal. Most people catch Legionnaires' disease by inhaling the bacteria from water or soil.Legionnaires\u2019 disease, the pneumonic form, has an incubation period of 2 to 10 days (but up to 16 days have been recorded in some outbreaks). It is an important cause of community- and hospital-acquired pneumonia, and although uncommon, Legionnaires\u2019 disease may cause outbreaks of public health significance. Initially, symptoms are fever, mild cough, loss of appetite, headache, malaise and lethargy, with some patients also experiencing muscle pain, diarrhoea and confusion. The severity of Legionnaires\u2019 disease ranges from a mild cough to rapidly fatal pneumonia. Untreated Legionnaires\u2019 disease usually worsens during the first week.Mortality from Legionnaires\u2019 disease depends on the severity of the disease, the use of antibiotic treatment, the setting where Legionella was acquired, and whether the patient has underlying conditions, including immunosuppression. The death rate may be as high as 40\u201380% in untreated immunosuppressed patients and can be reduced to 5\u201330% through appropriate case management, depending on the severity of the clinical signs and symptoms. Overall, the death rate is usually between 5\u201310%.",
        "Public Health Response": "Meetings of the crisis staff at the Mayor of Rzesz\u00f3w are held daily.Water samples were collected from the water supply system, residences of the sick, healthcare facilities, cooling towers, and installations in buildings\u00a0located in Rzesz\u00f3w, the Rzesz\u00f3w poviat, and the Ropczyce and S\u0119dzisz\u00f3w poviat.An epidemiological investigation, including interviews with patients or relatives, is underway to determine the source of infection.Mapping all positive cases, water sampling sites, and cooling towers is underway.Public fountains, public water sprays, and other public water sources have been shut down temporarily.Rzesz\u00f3w Municipal Water and Sewage Company carried out the routine disinfection of the water supply in the city of Rzesz\u00f3w and adjacent towns on 27\u00a0August 2023.Health care units and long-term care facilities have been instructed to carry out additional inspections of their water systems.Public health advice has been developed and shared across multiple channels.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Legionellosis varies in severity from a mild febrile illness to a severe and sometimes fatal form of pneumonia and is caused by exposure to\u00a0Legionella\u00a0species found in contaminated water and potting mixes. Outbreaks of Legionella have been linked to poorly maintained water systems, particularly cooling towers or evaporative condensers associated with air conditioning and industrial cooling, hot and cold-water systems in public and private buildings, and whirlpool spas.Infection can also occur by aspiration of contaminated water or ice, particularly in susceptible hospital patients. To date, there is no reported human-to-human transmission. Legionnaires' disease requires treatment with antibiotics, and currently, no vaccine is available for Legionnaires' disease.Sporadic outbreaks of Legionnaires' disease have been reported previously in Poland. Between 2017 and 2021, Poland reported between 38 to 74 cases of Legionnaires\u2019 disease annually to the European Surveillance System (TESSy). In 2022, this increased to 111 reported cases.Robust surveillance and response activities are being implemented during the current outbreak, and case numbers have been reduced. Nonetheless, without an identified source of\u00a0Legionella\u00a0bacteria, there is a continued risk of developing Legionellosis for people working or living in the affected areas. Older adults, smokers, and people with weakened immune systems are particularly susceptible to the disease.Travel-associated Legionnaires\u2019 disease (TALD) is a frequent phenomenon, with, on average, about 20% of the cases of legionellosis detected in Europe considered to be travel-associated. The outbreak is reported in the south-eastern city of Rzesz\u00f3w, the main hub for humanitarian aid for Ukraine and the transit hub for international military support for Ukraine; therefore, TALD may be expected in people visiting Rzesz\u00f3w.According to the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), in 2021, the EU/EEA witnessed the highest annual notification rate of Legionnaires\u2019 disease, with 2.4 cases per 100 000 population. The cause of the increased reported incidence observed during that period in Europe remains unclear. Legionnaires\u2019 disease is a notifiable disease in the EU, and the events are closely followed up through ECDC and European Legionnaires\u2019 Disease Surveillance Network (ELDSNet).",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO recommends the continuation of laboratory analyses, case identification and clinical care, contact tracing, outbreak investigation to identify the source(s), implementation of measures to prevent further infections, and enhancement of Infection, Prevention and Control (IPC) measures. IPC measures in health facilities have been enhanced during the COVID-19 pandemic and should be reinforced to prevent healthcare-associated transmission, including measures to control waterborne pathogens.\u00a0 WHO does not recommend any specific different measures for travellers. In case of symptoms suggestive of respiratory illness during or after travel, travellers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history with their healthcare provider. Countries with Legionella cases reported after travel to Poland should notify their regional IHR focal points.WHO advises against applying any travel or trade restrictions on Poland based on the current information available on this event.",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "Since epidemiological week 26, ending 2 July 2023, Nigeria has recorded an unusual increase in cases of diphtheria across several states. From 30 June to 31 August 2023, a total of 5898 suspected cases were reported from 59 Local Government Areas (LGAs) in 11 states. In week 34 (ending 27 August 2023), 234 suspected cases have been reported from 20 LGAs in five states, with one Lab confirmed case1 from the 22 samples collected. Eighteen of these cases were epidemiologically linked 2 and 141 were classified as clinically compatible.\nDiphtheria is a highly contagious vaccine-preventable disease caused mainly by the bacteria Corynebacterium diphtheriae which can be fatal in 5-10% of cases, with a higher mortality rate in young children.\nWHOs most recent risk assessment of the diphtheria outbreak in Nigeria has maintained the risk as high at the national level, and low at the regional and global levels. Public health measures such as vaccination response, enhanced surveillance for early case detection, case management and risk communication coordinated by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), in collaboration with WHO and other partners, are being implemented in response to the outbreak.",
        "Description of the Situation": "Since the last Disease Outbreak News\u00a0on diphtheria in Nigeria was published on 27 April 2023, the country has reported suspected cases of diphtheria weekly to WHO. However, between 30 June and 31 August 2023, Nigeria recorded an unusual increase in the number of confirmed diphtheria cases4 (figure 1). From 30 June to 31 August 2023, a total of 5898 suspected cases were reported from 59 LGAs in 11 states across the country. The majority (99.4%) of suspected cases were reported from Kano (1816), Katsina (234), Yobe (158), Bauchi (79), Kaduna (45) and Borno (33).\u00a0 Of the cumulative 8353 suspected cases reported since the outbreak was first reported in 2022, 4717 (56.5%) cases were confirmed4 (lab confirmed1 (169; 3.6%), epidemiologically linked2 (117; 2.5%) and clinical compatibility3 (4431; 93.9%)). While 1857 (22.2%) were discarded as not compatible with diphtheria, 1048 (12.5%) cases are pending classification and 731 (8.8%) cases had unknown diagnosis. The case fatality ratio dropped slightly from 6.7% during the last update to 6.1%. Of the 4717 confirmed cases, 3466 (73.5%) were aged 1 \u2013 14 years, of these 699 were aged 0-4 years, 1505 aged 5-9 years, 1262 (aged 10 \u2013 14 years. More than half of the cases (2656; 56.3%) were females. Only 1074 (22.8%) of the confirmed cases were fully vaccinated against diphtheria, 299 (6.3%) were partially vaccinated. More than half of the cases (2801; 59.4%) were unvaccinated. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Figure 1: Diphtheria cases by year/epi-week in Nigeria, 1 May 2022 \u2013 27 August 2023Definitive diagnosis through laboratory molecular testing identified Corynebacterium diphtheriae and Corynebacterium ulcerans isolates as the species driving this outbreak, particularly C. diphtheria as the major etiologic pathogen associated with the current outbreak. Antibiotic susceptibility tests for 62 isolates of C. diphtheriae have been carried out and the findings revealed that all isolates were resistant to penicillin, and most were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfathiazole and ciprofloxacin, while being susceptible to erythromycin. Thus, erythromycin became the drug of choice in the management of this outbreak (Figure 2).

        "Epidemiology": "Diphtheria is a highly contagious vaccine-preventable disease caused mainly by\u00a0Corynebacterium diphtheria\u00a0but also by\u00a0Corynebacterium ulcerans.\u00a0It spreads between people mainly by direct contact or through the air via respiratory droplets. The disease can affect all age groups; however, unimmunized children are most at risk.Symptoms often come on gradually, beginning with a sore throat and fever. In severe cases, the bacteria produce a poison (toxin) that causes a thick grey or white patch at the back of throat. This can block the airways, making it hard to breathe or swallow, and also creates a barking cough. The neck may swell in part due to enlarged lymph nodes.Treatment involves administering diphtheria antitoxin (DAT) as well as antibiotics. Vaccination against diphtheria has been effective in reducing the mortality and morbidity from diphtheria dramatically. Diphtheria is fatal in 5-10% of cases, with a higher mortality rate in young children. However, in settings with poor access to diphtheria antitoxin, the CFR can be as high as 40%.Nigeria has recorded diphtheria outbreaks in the past, notably in 2011 and 2022. In 2023, a previous outbreak of diphtheria was recorded between January and April 2023 affecting 21 of the 36 states and the FCT. Details of the outbreak have been published on\u00a0Disease Outbreak News.",
        "Public Health Response": "Coordination: WHO Country Office Incident Management System revised, National Emergency Operation Centre (EOC) activated likewise state EOC in the diphtheria high burden Kaduna, Katsina, Borno; partners mapping ongoing. Surveillance: Terms of reference for the pillar developed, regular follow up with the states to submit weekly situation report and line-list; WHO and other partners supported NCDC to develop contact tracking and harmonized line-list forms; database for states reporting on response activities p; dashboard for monitoring and evaluation of the response in development; Laboratory: procurement of commodities; activation of Kano lab to perform testing and culture at state level, transportation of samples; Vaccination: reactive vaccination Kano (phase 1 & 2), Katsina, Bauchi, Yobe, Kaduna (phase 1);Risk Communication and Community Engagement: engagement with community leaders, community awareness, development Information Education and Communication material, monitoring rumors, airing jingles, etc. Case management: supported development of national guideline for case management and surveillance; provided technical guidance on case management; deployed ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialists to treatment centers; Infection Prevention Control: monitoring of treatment centers on IPC measures is being undertaken; Operation Support and Logistics: procurement of 10 050 vials diphtheria antitoxin, 15 000 vial erythromycin ETA 28/08 and lab commodities; prepared delivery plan of Personal Protection Equipment to priority states; Preventing and Responding to Sexual Exploitation, Abuse and Harassment: conducted PRSEAH risk assessment.

        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Diphtheria is a vaccine-preventable disease caused mainly by exotoxin-producing Corynebacterium diphtheriae but also by Corynebacterium ulcerans.\u00a0 Diphtheria is fatal in 5 - 10% of cases, with a higher mortality rate in young children. Treatment involves administering DAT as well as antibiotics. Vaccination against diphtheria reduces the mortality and morbidity of diphtheria dramatically.Nigeria is currently facing a second wave of a diphtheria outbreak after a first wave of the outbreak was recorded between epidemiological week 52, 2022 (1 January 2023) and week 20, 2023 (22 May 2023). There is an increase in the affected population with a rise in the number of confirmed cases and related deaths reported in epidemiological weeks 31-33. There is an increased risk of transmission, with clusters and outbreaks reported in newly affected LGAs, with currently 27 LGAs reporting one clinically compatible case in the last three reporting weeks relative to 15 LGAs that had active case in the preceding three weeks.The low national coverage (57%) of the Pentavalent vaccine (Penta 3) administered in routine immunization, and the suboptimal vaccination coverage in the pediatric population\u2014with 43% of the target population unvaccinated\u2014underscores the risk of further spread and the accumulation of a critical mass of susceptible population in the country with sub-optimal herd or population immunity. Vaccine coverage of 80\u201385% must be maintained to ensure community protection.This emphasizes the urgent need to strengthen diphtheria vaccination coverage nationwide, especially in the most affected states, such as Kano. Additionally, particular attention is necessary for regions experiencing insecurity challenges, like the Northwest, as it hampers vaccine accessibility. Due to insecurity, especially in Northeast Nigeria, vaccination coverage remains suboptimal.DAT supply is currently very constrained and insufficient to respond to current demands, as there is only a limited number of manufacturers and large outbreaks are being reported in different regions of the world. \u00a0The NCDC, with support from WHO and other partners have procured 10 050 DAT vials for case management in response to the outbreak.Diphtheria outbreaks are underreported in Nigeria. According to the 2021 Nigeria Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey and National Immunization Coverage Survey, the third dose of pentavalent vaccine (Penta3) coverage was 57% in 2021.WHO second Rapid Risk Assessment for diphtheria in Nigeria reassessed and maintained the risk as high at the national level and low at the regional and global levels.",
        "WHO Advice": "The control of diphtheria is based on primary prevention of disease by ensuring high population immunity through vaccination, and secondary prevention of spread by the rapid investigation of close contacts to ensure prompt treatment of those infected.Epidemiological surveillance ensuring early detection of diphtheria outbreaks should be in place in all countries, and all countries should have access to laboratory facilities for reliable identification of toxigenic C. diphtheriae. Adequate quantities of diphtheria antitoxin should be available nationally or regionally for the medical management of cases.Vaccination is key to preventing cases and outbreaks, and adequate clinical management involves administering diphtheria anti-toxin to neutralize the toxin and antibiotics reducing complications and mortality.WHO recommends early reporting and case management of suspected diphtheria cases to initiate the timely treatment of cases, and follow-up of contacts, and ensuring a supply of diphtheria antitoxin.WHO advises implementing the following Infection Prevention & Control measures in health care settings:1) Apply standard precautions, with focus on hand hygiene, personal protective equipment and equipment and environmental cleaning and disinfection droplet and contact precautions (at all times).2) At screening/triage, immediately place patients with symptoms of Upper Respiratory Tract Infection in a separate area until examined, and, if a suspected case, cohorted with patients with the same diagnosis. Keep the isolation area segregated from other patient-care areas.3) Maintain one meter between patients. Keep patient care areas well ventilated.4) Avoid patient movement or transport out of isolation area. If movement is necessary out of isolation area, have patient use a medical mask and cover any wounds/lesions on patient\u2019s body.The case management should be carried out following the WHO guidelines. In addition, high-risk populations such as young children under five years of age, school children, the elderly, close contact with diphtheria cases, and healthcare workers should be vaccinated on a priority basis. A coordinated response and community engagement can support further transmission and control of the ongoing outbreak. Prophylactic antibiotics (penicillin or erythromycin, dependent on drug sensitivity) are indicated for close contacts of confirmed cases for seven days. If the culture is positive for toxigenic Corynebacterium spp., then the contact should be treated as a case with an antibiotic course for two weeks (DAT is not needed for asymptomatic cases or cases without a pseudomembrane).Although travelers do not have a special risk of diphtheria infection, it is recommended that national authorities remind travelers going to areas with diphtheria outbreaks to be appropriately vaccinated in accordance with the national vaccination scheme established in each country prior to travel. A booster dose is recommended if more than five years have passed since their last dose.",

        "Outbreak name": "Influenza A (H1N1) variant virus",
        "Date Reported": "13 September 2023",
        "Location": "the Netherlands",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 2 September 2023, the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport of the Netherlands notified the World Health Organization (WHO) of a laboratory-confirmed human case of infection with a swine-origin influenza A(H1N1) variant (v) virus in the province of North Brabant, Netherlands. This is the first human infection caused by influenza A(H1N1)v virus reported in the Netherlands in 2023.\nWorldwide sporadic human cases of influenza A(H1N1)v have been reported previously, including from the Netherlands. According to the International Health Regulations (IHR,2005), a human infection caused by a novel influenza A virus subtype is an event that has the potential for high public health impact and must be notified to the WHO.\nThis case was picked up as part of routine surveillance of respiratory illnesses. Based on the available information, there is no clear indication of the source of infection, and no direct contact with pigs was reported. As of 7 September, there were no symptomatic contacts of this case and no further detections have been reported in routine surveillance. All five close contacts were followed for 10 days- the maximum incubation period and none developed symptoms. Thus, there was no evidence of person-to-person transmission and the case is considered as a sporadic human case of influenza A(H1N1)v. The likelihood of community-level spread among humans and/or international disease spread through humans is considered as low.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 2 September 2023, WHO was notified of a confirmed human infection with a swine influenza A(H1N1)v virus, in Netherlands through the European Commission's confidential Early Warning and Response System (EWRS).The case is an adult from the province of North Brabant with no underlying medical conditions and no history of occupational exposure to animals. On 20 August 2023, the patient developed fatigue and general malaise and the following day developed an acute respiratory infection with onset of chills, sneeze, cough, headache, and generalized weakness, followed by fever on 22 August. On 21 August 2023, the patient reported symptoms as part of participatory surveillance[1] of acute respiratory infections and submitted a self-collected combined nose and throat swab specimen to the laboratory. On 22 August 2023, the specimen was forwarded at the Dutch National Influenza Centre location at the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) where it tested positive for influenza A virus and negative for A(H1N1)pdm09, both tests included on a commercial 24 pathogen multiplex nucleic acid amplification assay on 23 August. Further routine subtyping was performed on 24 and 25 August with RT-qPCR assays. Tests for seasonal influenza viruses and H5 viruses were negative. In addition, a laboratory-developed test (LDT) and another commercial assay for generic influenza A virus detection confirmed the presence of type A influenza virus in the specimen.Routine whole genome sequencing using nanopore technique and virus isolation were started on 28 August. On 30 August, sequencing results revealed that the virus, A/Netherlands/10534/2023, is an A(H1N1)v Eurasian avian-like clade 1C.2.2 swine influenza virus. The HA genome segment clustered closely with recent clade 1C.2.2 swine influenza viruses from 2022 and 2023 from the Netherlands.[2] It clustered less closely with previous clade 1C.2.2 A(H1N1)v (from 2019) and A(H1N2)v (from 2020) viruses from the Netherlands. Phenotypically, the virus is sensitive to neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir.The virus isolate will be shared with the WHO Collaborating Centre in London, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH) avian and swine influenza reference laboratory at the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA), UK. The sequences are available from the GISAID database under accession EPI_ISL_18168180.As of 13 September, the person is recovered. Investigations reported that the individual did not work at a pig farm or other business involving pigs and does not work in health care. Therefore, there is no clear indication of the source of infection.",
        "Epidemiology": "Influenza A(H1) viruses are enzootic in swine populations in most regions of the world. When an influenza virus that normally circulates in swine is detected in a person, it is called a \u201cvariant influenza virus\u201d. H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2 are major subtypes of swine influenza A viruses in pigs and occasionally infect humans, usually after direct or indirect exposure to pigs or contaminated environments.Human infections with variant viruses tend to result in mild clinical illness, although some cases have been hospitalized with more severe disease and some have been fatal.Sporadic human infections caused by influenza A(H1N1)v and A(H1N2)v viruses have been reported in the Netherlands previously, and there has been no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission.This is the first human infection caused by swine influenza A(H1N1)v virus reported in 2023 in the Netherlands, and the third human infection over the past five years. Since 1986, nine variant cases have been documented in humans in the Netherlands.",
        "Public Health Response": "National authorities monitored the case and all close contacts. As of 7 September, none of the five close contacts have reported any symptoms. Further antigenic virus characterization is ongoing. The Zoonosis Centre and veterinarians conducted an investigation, but no possible source of infection was identified. \u00a0Therefore, no animal monitoring or testing was performed.Few influenza viruses are currently detected in the Netherlands, and none of these characterized are variant swine influenza A viruses, apart from the current case reported.The (online) participatory surveillance; part of\u00a0www.influenzanet.info is focused on syndromic surveillance among those who may not seek care for their illness and includes a self-test study with over 17 000 participants. Participants are asked each week whether they have symptoms. From those who report a sore throat, runny nose, cough, or dyspnoea up to 200 persons are invited each week to send in a combined nose and throat swab for centralized testing at the RIVM. Over 5500 specimens have been tested since October 2022.[3]",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Most human cases result from exposure to swine influenza viruses through contact with infected swine or contaminated environments. Occasionally, the source of exposure has remained unidentified. As these viruses continue to be detected in swine populations worldwide, further human cases following direct or indirect contact with infected swine can be expected.Current evidence suggests that these viruses have not acquired the ability to sustain transmission among humans. There has been limited, non-sustained human-to-human transmission of variant influenza viruses, although ongoing community transmission has not been identified. In this event, there was no human-to-human transmission resulting in symptomatic disease detected and no further detections have been reported in routine surveillance.The risk of detecting additional cases associated with this event appears to be low.If needed, the risk assessment will be reviewed should further epidemiological or virological information become available.",
        "WHO Advice": "Surveillance:This case does not change the current WHO recommendations on public health measures and seasonal influenza surveillance.WHO does not advise special traveller screening at points of entry or restrictions concerning the current situation of influenza viruses at the human-animal interface.\u00a0Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect virological, epidemiological and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health and timely virus sharing for risk assessment.Notification and investigation:\u00a0All human infections caused by a novel influenza subtype are notifiable under the IHR and State Parties to the IHR (2005) are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic. Evidence of illness is not required.In the case of a confirmed or suspected human infection caused by a novel influenza virus with pandemic potential, including a variant virus, a thorough epidemiologic investigation of a history of exposure to animals, travel, and contact tracing should be conducted. The epidemiologic investigation should include early identification of unusual respiratory events that could signal person-to-person transmission of the novel virus. Clinical samples collected from the time and place of the case should be tested and sent to a WHO Collaboration Center for further characterization.\u00a0Travel and trade:WHO does not recommend any travel and/or trade restrictions for the Netherlands based on the currently available information.\u00a0\u00a0Prevention measures:\u00a0\u00a0General hygiene measures, such as washing hands before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered. Travelers to countries with known outbreaks of animal influenza should avoid farms, contact with animals in live animal markets, entering areas where animals may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with animal faeces. Influenza viruses that infect pigs are different from human influenza viruses. There is no vaccine for influenza A(H1N1)v infection licensed for use in humans. However, some partners develop candidate vaccine viruses (CVV) for novel zoonotic influenza viruses with pandemic potential as part of pandemic preparedness activities.Generally, influenza vaccines against human influenza viruses are not expected to protect people from influenza viruses that normally circulate in pigs. Although the seasonal influenza vaccine does not protect against swine viruses, WHO recommends seasonal influenza vaccination to avoid severe disease from infection with the seasonal influenza virus.",

        "Location": "Saudi Arabia",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "From 13 September 2022 to 12 August 2023, three laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), including two deaths, were reported to WHO by the Ministry of Health of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Close contacts for the three cases were followed up by the Ministry of Health, and no secondary cases were identified. The notification of these cases reiterates the need for global awareness of MERS-CoV as the disease continues to pose a threat in countries where MERS-CoV is circulating in dromedary camels, including those in the Middle East.",
        "Description of the Situation": "Between 13 September 2022 to 12 August 2023, the Ministry of Health of KSA reported three additional cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), with two associated deaths. The cases were reported from Riyadh, Asser, and Makkah Al Mukarramah regions (Figure 1).\u00a0Laboratory confirmation of the cases was performed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).All three cases were non-health-care workers, who presented with fever, cough, and shortness of breath, and had comorbidities. Of the three cases, two had a history of contact with dromedary camels and all three cases had a history of consumption of raw camel milk in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. All three cases were male, and aged 42, 83, and 85 years respectively (Table 1).Since the first report of MERS-CoV in KSA in 2012, human infections have been reported from 27 countries, in all six WHO regions. Of the reported 2605 cases, the majority of MERS-CoV cases (2196; 84%) have been reported from KSA, including these newly reported cases. Of the 937 deaths reported from 27 countries, a total of 856 (91%) deaths have been reported from KSA, including the newly reported deaths (Figure 2).Figure 1.\u00a0Geographical distribution of MERS-CoV cases between 13 September 2022 and 12 August by city and region, KSA (n=3).Table 1.\u00a0MERS-CoV cases reported by KSA between 13 September 2022 and 12 August 2023Figure 2:\u00a0 Epidemic curve of MERS-CoV cases and deaths reported in KSA between 2012 and 12 August 2023",
        "Epidemiology": "Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory infection caused by the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Approximately 36% of patients with MERS have died, though this may be an overestimate of the true mortality rate, as mild cases of MERS-CoV may be missed by existing surveillance systems, and the case fatality ratio (CFR) is calculated based only on laboratory-confirmed cases.Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedary camels, which are the natural host and zoonotic source of the virus. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts and in healthcare settings and outside of the healthcare setting, there has been limited human-to-human transmission.MERS-CoV infections range from showing no symptoms (asymptomatic) or mild respiratory symptoms, to severe acute respiratory disease and death. A typical presentation of MERS disease is fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Pneumonia is a common finding, but not always present. Gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhoea, have also been reported. Severe illness can cause respiratory failure that requires mechanical ventilation and support in an intensive care unit. The virus appears to cause more severe disease in older people, persons with weakened immune systems, and those with comorbidities or chronic diseases such as renal disease, cancer, chronic lung disease, and diabetes.No vaccine or specific treatment is currently available, although several MERS-CoV-specific vaccines and therapeutics are in development. Treatment is supportive and based on the patient\u2019s clinical condition and symptoms.",
        "Public Health Response": "Follow-up of the close contacts was conducted for all three cases, and no secondary cases were identified.For the two cases reporting contact with camels, the Ministry of Agriculture was informed, and an investigation of camels was conducted. There are no treatments available for MERS-CoV in animals. The identified positive camels were isolated until RT-PCR testing was negative.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "From 13 September 2012 to 12 August 2023, the total number of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection cases reported globally to WHO was 2605, with 937 (CFR 36%) associated deaths. The majority of these cases occurred in countries in the Arabian Peninsula, including\u00a02196 cases with 856 related deaths (CFR 39%) in KSA. There has been one large outbreak outside of the Middle East, in the Republic of Korea, in May 2015, during which 186 laboratory-confirmed cases (185 in the Republic of Korea and 1 in China) and 38 deaths were reported. The index case in that outbreak had a travel history to the Middle East. The global number reflects the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases reported to WHO under IHR (2005) or directly by Ministries of Health. The total number of deaths includes the deaths that WHO is aware of to date through follow-up with affected Member States.\u00a0WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East and/or other countries where MERS-CoV is circulating in dromedaries, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who were exposed to the virus through contact with\u00a0dromedaries\u00a0or their products (for example, consumption of raw camel milk), or in a healthcare setting. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.\u00a0\u00a0The number of MERS cases reported to WHO has substantially declined since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. This is likely the result of epidemiological surveillance activities for COVID-19 being prioritized and the similar clinical picture of both diseases, resulting in reduced testing and detection of MERS CoV cases. The Ministry of Health of KSA is working to improve testing capacities for better detection of MERS-CoV during the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0In addition, measures taken during the COVID-19 pandemic to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission (e.g., mask wearing, hand hygiene, physical distancing, improving ventilation of indoor spaces, respiratory etiquette, stay-at-home orders, reduced mobility) also likely reduced opportunities for onward human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV.",
        "WHO Advice": "Based on the current situation and available information, WHO re-emphasizes the importance of strong surveillance by all Member States for acute respiratory infections, including MERS-CoV, and to carefully review and investigate any unusual patterns.\u00a0Human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV in healthcare settings has been associated with delays in recognizing the early symptoms of MERS-CoV infection, slow triage of suspected cases, and delays in implementing infection, prevention, and control (IPC) measures. IPC measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV between people in healthcare facilities. Healthcare workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, at every interaction in healthcare settings. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures or in settings where aerosol generating procedures are conducted. Early identification, case management and isolation of cases, quarantine of contacts, together with appropriate infection prevention and control measures in health care setting and public health awareness can prevent human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV.\u00a0 MERS-CoV appears to cause more severe disease in people with underlying chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons. Therefore, people with these underlying medical conditions should avoid close contact with animals, particularly dromedaries, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus may be circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.\u00a0 Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk, camel urine or eating meat that has not been thoroughly cooked.\u00a0 The consumption of raw or undercooked animal products, including milk and meat, carries a high risk of infection from pathogens that may cause disease in humans. Animal products that are processed appropriately through cooking or pasteurization are safe for consumption. Foods that have gone through these processes should be handled with care to avoid cross contamination with uncooked/unsafe foods. Camel meat and camel milk are nutritious products that can continue to be consumed after cooking, pasteurization or other thermal treatments. WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry regarding this event, nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.",

        "Date Reported": "23 August 2023",
        "Location": "Chile",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 12 August 2023, the IHR National Focal Point of Chile notified WHO of a confirmed case of measles in the Metropolitan Region. The case had history of travel to Georgia, where measles is endemic, and Armenia, where measles has been eliminated, and returning to Chile via Qatar and Brazil. To date no further cases related to this importation have been detected.\nThis is the first measles case reported in Chile since 2020. As soon as the case was notified, the local and national authorities implemented control measures, including case isolation and an epidemiological investigation to identify the exposed contacts and refer them for vaccination, and reinforced surveillance activities in the public and private health network.\nMeasles is a highly contagious acute viral disease but can be prevented by immunization. Chile interrupted local transmission of measles in 1993. Imported cases are expected, and the susceptibility of contacts determines the spread of the disease.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 12 August 2023, IHR National Focal Point of Chile notified WHO of a confirmed case of measles in the Metropolitan Region. The patient is a 42-year-old male from Chile with a history of travel to Armenia and Georgia (between 16 July and 26 July, returning to Chile on 26 July via Qatar and Brazil), and no history of vaccination against measles. This is the first imported case of measles reported in Chile since 2020.On 7 August 2023, the patient presented with symptoms consistent with chills, myalgias, fever and malaise, twelve days after his return to Chile. On 8 August 2023, the case developed a rash (13 days after return) and on 9 and 10 August, he sought medical attention in two different health care facilities.On 10 August 2023, serum and urine samples were collected and tested reactive for measles by IgM and PCR at a private clinic laboratory. On 11 August 2023, the samples were sent to the Public Health Institute of Chile, the national reference laboratory, where they tested reactive for measles by IgM and PCR on the same day. The patient did not require hospitalization, and as of 17 August, his progress has been favourable.The patient has been in contact with about a thousand people through exposures at home, work, school, in waiting rooms of health facilities and others. As of 17 August, the contacts are under follow-up, and 325 contacts have received a dose of MMR, or standard immunoglobulin (for special groups), in the context of this outbreak, other contacts have accredited vaccination (National Immunization Registry- RNI per its acronym in Spanish or vaccination certificate) of two doses against measles, and the rest are still in the referral process to complete the missing doses.In Chile, the current vaccination scheme considers the administration of two doses of measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine: the first dose at 12 months of life and the second dose at 36 months of age. Official measles immunization coverage in Chile with the first dose for MMR vaccine was 93.9% in 2022 and was 52.9% as of epidemiological week 26 of 2023, being below the percentage of sustained homogeneous coverage of at least 95% recommended by the WHO.\u00a0According to WHO/UNICEF National Immunization Coverage (WEUNIC) estimates, Chile's vaccination coverage with two doses of measles-containing vaccine (MCV2) was less than 60% over the past two years. In addition, within this national coverage, there are subnational variations (rural and peripheral urban areas) which could include pockets of unvaccinated people in all age groups.",
        "Epidemiology": "Measles is a highly contagious acute viral disease, which affects susceptible individuals of all ages and remains one of the leading causes of death among young children globally. The mode of transmission is airborne or via droplets from the nose, mouth, or throat of infected persons.Early symptoms of measles are fever (as high as 40\u00b0C) and malaise, cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis, followed by a rash with both raised and flat areas (maculopapular rash). The rash usually appears 14 days after exposure and spreads from the head to the trunk to the lower extremities. A patient is infectious from four days before up to four days after the appearance of the rash. There is no specific antiviral treatment for measles and most people recover within 2-3 weeks.Measles is usually a mild or moderately severe disease. However, measles can lead to complications such as pneumonia, inflammation of brain (encephalitis), and death. Postinfectious encephalitis can occur in about one in every 1000 reported cases of measles. About two or three deaths may occur for every 1000 reported cases of measles.Among malnourished children and immunocompromised people including people with HIV, cancer and treated with immunosuppressives, as well as pregnant women, measles can also cause serious complications, including blindness, encephalitis, severe diarrhoea, ear infection, and pneumonia.Measles can be prevented by immunization. In countries with low vaccination coverage, epidemics typically occur every two to three years and usually last between two and three months, although their duration varies according to population size, crowding, and the population\u2019s immunity status.",
        "Public Health Response": "The following public health measures were implemented by local and national health authorities:Intensification of epidemiological surveillance with active and retrospective institutional search for cases.Identification and follow-up of contacts for 21 days post-exposure.Vaccination of contacts if there was no immunization record.Use of standard immunoglobulin in the population at risk.Notification, through IHR NFPs, of contacts who travelled to other countries.Sending information to the IHR NFP of Georgia and Armenia for follow-up.Additionally, during the second semester of this year, the updated strategy for students from 1st to 8th grade will be implemented in Chile\u00a0[1].",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Measles remains one of the leading causes of death among young children worldwide. It is highly contagious, with 90% of non-immune people exposed to an infectious individual estimated to contract the disease. \u00a0In 2016, the Region of the Americas was the first Region of WHO to be declared free of endemic transmission of measles viruses by the International Expert Committee (IEC) for\u00a0Documenting and Verifying Measles, Rubella and the Congenital Rubella Syndrome in the Americas.\u00a0Nevertheless, maintaining the Region free of measles is an ongoing challenge due to the permanent risk of importation and reintroduction of the virus. This case corresponds to a susceptible cohort of people born between 1971 and 1981 who were not immunized with two doses of MMR or did not previously present with the disease.During the COVID-19 pandemic, there might be a risk of disruption to routine immunization activities due to both COVID-19 related burden on the health system and decreased demand for vaccination because of physical distancing requirements or community reluctance. Disruption of immunization services even for a short time can result in increased numbers of susceptible individuals and raise the likelihood of outbreak-prone vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) such as measles.",
        "WHO Advice": "Measles anywhere is a problem everywhere because it spreads so easily. WHO recommends that countries in all regions continue to make progress towards achieving measles elimination in line with each of the endorsed Regional Goals of all WHO regions to achieve measles elimination, as well as the global strategy under IA2030, the Measles and Rubella Strategic Framework. WHO recommends strengthening the efforts to implement the \"Plan of Action for the Sustainability of Measles, Rubella, and Congenital Rubella Syndrome Elimination in the Americas 2018-2023\", with its four strategic sections: 1) guarantee universal access to vaccination services; 2) strengthen the capacity of epidemiological surveillance systems for measles, rubella, and congenital rubella syndrome; 3) develop the national operational capacity to maintain the elimination status; 4) establish standard mechanisms for rapid response to imported measles, rubella, and congenital rubella syndrome cases to prevent the re-establishment of endemic transmission in the countries.WHO recommends strengthening epidemiological surveillance in high-traffic border areas to rapidly detect and respond to highly suspected measles cases. Providing a rapid response to imported measles cases to avoid the establishment of endemic transmission through the activation of rapid response teams trained for this purpose and by implementing national rapid response protocols when there are imported cases. Once a rapid response team has been activated, continued coordination between the national, sub-national and local levels must be ensured, with permanent communication channels between all levels. During outbreaks, it is recommended to establish adequate hospital case management to avoid nosocomial transmission, with appropriate referral of patients to isolation rooms (for any level of care) and avoiding contact with other patients in waiting rooms and/or other hospital rooms.WHO recommends vaccination of at-risk populations without proof of vaccination or immunity against measles and rubella, such as health care workers, persons working in tourism and transportation (hotels, airports, border crossings, mass transportation, and others), and international travellers who are visiting measles endemic countries. Implementing a plan to immunize migrant populations in high-traffic border areas, prioritizing those considered at-risk, including both migrants and residents, in these municipalities increases vaccination coverage to increase population immunity.In all settings consideration should be given to providing susceptible contacts with post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), including a dose of MCV or normal human immunoglobulin (NHIG) (if available) for those at risk and in whom the vaccine is contraindicated. In well-resourced settings, MCV should be provided to susceptible contacts within 3 days. For contacts for whom vaccination is contraindicated or is not possible within 3 days post-exposure, consideration can be given to providing NHIG up to 6 days post-exposure. Infants, pregnant women, and the immunocompromised should be prioritized.WHO recommends maintaining sustained homogeneous coverage of at least 95% with the first and second doses of the MCV vaccine in all municipalities and strengthening integrated epidemiological surveillance of measles and rubella to achieve timely detection of all suspected cases in public, private, and social security healthcare facilities.WHO recommends maintaining a stock of the measles-rubella (MR)and/or measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine, and syringes/supplies for control actions of imported cases. Facilitating the access to vaccination services according to the national scheme to foreigners or people from the same country who perform temporary activities in countries with ongoing outbreaks; displaced populations; indigenous populations, or other vulnerable populations.WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel and trade to Chile based on the information available on the current outbreak.",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 4 August 2023, the United States International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Point informed PAHO/WHO of a human infection with a novel influenza A(H1N2) variant virus identified in the State of Michigan. This was confirmed by Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction at the United States (US) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on August 2.\nThe case was not hospitalized and is recovering from the illness. Investigations by local public health officials identified swine exposure by the patient at an agricultural fair.\nAdditional public health response efforts including enhanced surveillance for cases is undergoing. Given the potential impact on public health, human infections with these viruses need to be monitored closely. In this event, there was no reported evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission, the illness was mild and no further influenza variant virus transmission in the community has been identified.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 4 August 2023, the United States IHR National Focal Point informed PAHO/WHO of a human infection with a novel influenza A(H1N2) variant virus identified in the State of Michigan and confirmed by the US CDC.\u00a0 According to the report, the case is under 18 years old, with no comorbidities, resident in the State of Michigan, who developed respiratory illness on 29 July 2023. The case presented with fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches, headache, shortness of breath, diarrhea, nausea, dizziness, and lethargy. On 29 July, the case sought medical care at an emergency department, and an upper respiratory tract specimen was collected on 30 July. The specimen tested positive for influenza A virus on the same day. On 1 August, the patient received influenza antiviral treatment (Oseltamivir).On 31 July, the specimen was tested at the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS), and RT-PCR results were positive for influenza A virus but lacked reactivity with diagnostic tests for contemporary human influenza viruses representing either (H1) pdm09 or (H3) subtypes. The specimen was then sent to the US CDC for further testing and received on 2 August. On the same day, RT-PCR analysis of the specimen indicated an influenza A(H1N2) variant (v) virus. The virus was isolated and subsequent analysis including genetic sequencing is underway.The case was not hospitalized. Investigation by local public health officials identified swine exposure by the patient at an agricultural fair, that took place between 23 and 29 July, within 10 days prior to illness onset. Additional investigation did not identify respiratory illness in any of the patient\u2019s close contacts or household contacts. No additional cases were identified related to this agriculture fair. No person-to-person transmission of influenza A(H1N2)v virus associated with this case has been identified. No additional cases of human infection with A(H1N2)v virus have been identified as of 10 August 2023.This is the first influenza A(H1N2)v virus infection identified in the United States this year. Since 2005, there have been 512 influenza A variant virus infections (all subtypes), including 37 (human infections with influenza A (H1N2)v viruses reported in the United States.",
        "Epidemiology": "Swine influenza A(H1N2) viruses circulate in swine populations in many regions of the world. Influenza A viruses that normally circulate in swine are called \u201cvariant\u201d influenza viruses when isolated from humans.1\u00a0Human infections are usually due to direct or indirect exposure to pigs or contaminated environments. There may be important antigenic and genetic differences between seasonal influenza viruses that circulate worldwide in the human population and influenza viruses that normally circulate in swine. Close monitoring is needed\u00a0to early identify changes in the virus and/or its transmission to humans.2Non-seasonal or zoonotic influenza viruses infecting humans may cause disease ranging from mild conjunctivitis to severe pneumonia and even death; usually, these human infections of zoonotic influenza are acquired through direct contact with infected animals or contaminated environments. Since 2005, 37 human infections with influenza A(H1N2)v virus, including this one, have been reported in the United States.",
        "Public Health Response": "The public health response efforts led by local officials included enhanced surveillance for cases. The county health department conducted active case finding by reaching out to fair exhibitors and their families to ascertain additional illnesses.\u00a0 In addition, local providers were notified to watch for respiratory illness in persons who had attended the fair or had recent contact with swine.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Swine influenza A viruses circulate in swine populations in many regions of the world. Depending on geographic location, the genetic characteristics of these viruses differ. When an influenza A virus that normally circulates in swine (but not people) is detected in a person, it is called a \u201cvariant influenza virus\u201d. Most human cases are the result of exposure to swine influenza A viruses through contact with infected swine or contaminated environments. Because these viruses continue to be detected in swine populations around the world, further human cases can be expected.According to the IHR, a human infection caused by a novel influenza A virus subtype is an event that has the potential for high public health impact. A novel influenza A virus is considered to have the potential to cause a pandemic if (1) the virus has demonstrated the capacity to infect and transmit efficiently among humans, and (2) differs from currently circulating seasonal human influenza viruses (i.e., A/H1 or A/H3), circulating widely in the human population such that the hemagglutinin (HA) gene (or protein) is not a mutated form of those; and (3) the population has little to no immunity against it. To date, only sporadic human infections caused by influenza A(H3N2), A(H1N1) and A(H1N2) variant viruses have been reported in the United States, and there has been no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission. Human infections with influenza variant viruses tend to result in mild clinical illness, although some cases have been hospitalized with more severe disease. Given the potential impact on public health, human infections with these viruses need to be monitored closely. In this event, there was no reported evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission, the illness was mild and no further influenza variant virus transmission in the community has been identified. There has been some limited, non-sustained human-to-human transmission of variant influenza A viruses, although ongoing community transmission has not been identified. Current evidence suggests that these viruses have not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans. The risk assessment will be reviewed if needed should further epidemiological or virological information become available. Influenza A viruses that infect pigs are different from human influenza A viruses. Currently, there is no vaccine for Influenza A(H1N2)v infection licensed for use in humans. Thus, influenza vaccines against human influenza viruses are generally not expected to protect people from influenza viruses that normally circulate in pigs.",
        "WHO Advice": "This case does not change the current WHO recommendations on public health measures and surveillance of seasonal influenza.WHO does not advise special traveller screening at points of entry or restrictions with regards to the current situation of influenza viruses at the human-animal interface. For recommendations on safe trade in animals and related products from countries affected by these influenza viruses, refer to\u00a0WOAH guidance.\u00a0The public should avoid contact with animals that are sick or dead from unknown causes, including wild animals, and should report dead wild birds and mammals or request their removal by contacting local wildlife or veterinary authorities.WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of animal influenza should avoid farms, contact with animals in live animal markets, entering areas where animals may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with animal excreta. Travelers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. All individuals should follow good food safety and hygiene practices.\u00a0Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect virologic, epidemiologic and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health and timely virus sharing for risk assessment. Continued vigilance is needed within affected and neighbouring areas to detect infections in animals and humans. Collaboration between the animal and human health sectors is essential. As the extent of influenza viruses circulation in animals is not clear, epidemiologic and virologic surveillance and the follow-up of suspected human cases should continue systematically. Guidance on investigation of non-seasonal influenza and other emerging acute respiratory diseases has been published on the WHO website\u00a0here.Vigilance for the emergence of novel influenza viruses of pandemic potential should be maintained. WHO has developed practical guidance for integrated surveillance in the context of the cocirculation of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses. The guidance is available\u00a0here.All human infections caused by a new subtype of influenza virus are notifiable under the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005). State Parties to the IHR (2005) are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic. Evidence of illness is not required for this report.\u00a0It is critical that these influenza viruses from animals or from people are fully characterized in appropriate animal or human health influenza reference laboratories. Under WHO\u2019s Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework, Member States are expected to share Influenza Viruses with Pandemic Potential (IVPP) on a regular and timely basis with the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), a WHO-coordinated network of public health laboratories. The viruses are used by the public health laboratories to assess the risk of pandemic influenza and to develop relevant candidate vaccine viruses.",

        "Outbreak name": "Dengue",
        "Date Reported": "11 August 2023",
        "Location": "Bangladesh",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "From 1 January to 7 August 2023, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of Bangladesh reported a total of 69 483 laboratory-confirmed dengue cases and 327 related deaths, with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 0.47%. Of these, 63% of cases and 62% of the deaths were reported in the month of July 2023. Although dengue is endemic in Bangladesh, the current dengue surge is unusual in terms of seasonality and the early sharp increase in comparison to previous years, where the surge started around -late June. The CFR so far this year is relatively high compared to previous years for the full-year period. The pre-monsoon Aedes survey shows that the density of mosquitoes, and the number of potential hotspots is at the highest level in the past five years.\nThe higher incidence of dengue is taking place in the context of an unusual episodic amount of rainfall, combined with high temperatures and high humidity, which have resulted in an increased mosquito population throughout Bangladesh.",
        "Description of the Situation": "Between 1 January and 7 August 2023, a total of 69 483 dengue cases including 327 related deaths (case fatality rate = 0.47%) were reported by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW). As of\u00a030 June\u00a02023, a total of\u00a07978 cases and 47 deaths were reported, however, the cases started surging rapidly from late June and in the month of July alone 63% of cases (n=43 854) and 62% of deaths (n= 204) were reported.\u00a0The number of cases and deaths are higher compared to similar periods in the past five years (Figure 1). Dengue cases started to rise in\u00a0May 2023 and have been continuing since then, and\u00a0the peak is unlikely to have been reached.\u00a0The reported number of dengue cases this year is the highest compared to the same periods recorded since 2000. The cases are reported from all\u00a064\u00a0districts in the\u00a0country.\u00a0 Cases\u00a0in Dhaka division\u00a0started to increase in epidemic week 17 (23-29 April 2023) and in all eight divisions since epidemic week 26 (25 June to 1 July 2023).\u00a0 The most affected area in the Dhaka division is Dhaka city corporation, accounting for 52.8% of cases and 78.9% of deaths. Other affected divisions include Chattogram division (13.2% of cases and 9.2% of deaths), Dhaka division\u00a0excluding Dhaka city\u00a0(11.6% of cases and\u00a02.8% of deaths), and Barisal division (10.5% of cases and 4.3% of deaths). The Sylhet division has\u00a0the lowest number of cases\u00a0(560) and no deaths\u00a0reported so far.As of 7 August 2023, the\u00a0reported CFR is 0.47%, which\u00a0is\u00a0higher\u00a0compared to previous years (table 1).\u00a0On further analysis,\u00a0the overall CFR is higher in females than in males (0.72% v 0.32%) with females having four times higher CFR than males\u00a0among those aged 21-40 years\u00a0(0.71% vs 0.18%). The older age group recorded\u00a0a\u00a0higher CFR compared to\u00a0the\u00a0younger age group (1.87% in the age group over 60 years compared to 0.74% in the age group between 41 to 60 years and 0.34% in those aged 40 years and below). DENV2 was the predominant circulating serotype in Bangladesh until 2018, when it was replaced by DENV3 as the predominant serotype since 2019.\u00a0\u00a0However, DENV2 has been identified as the primary circulating serotype in this outbreak, and this may result in more severe dengue infections and hospitalizations as a result of a second infection with a heterologous serotype. Of the 66 serotyped samples in\u00a0the month of June 2023, DENV2 (51.5%) and DENV3 (43.9%) were identified as the circulating serotypes.Figure 1. Number of dengue cases (A) and deaths (B) reported by epidemic week from 2018 to 2023 [as of 5 August (epidemiological week 31) 2023]\u00a0Table 1: Dengue cases, deaths, and case fatality rate in Bangladesh for 2018, 2019, 2021, 2022 and 2023\u00a0\u00a0 Data source: DGHS\u00a0(*data for 2020 is limited due to COVID-19)",
        "Epidemiology": "Dengue is a viral infection transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes and is found in tropical and sub-tropical climates worldwide, mostly in urban and semi-urban areas. The primary vectors that transmit the disease are\u00a0Aedes aegypti\u00a0mosquitoes and, to a lesser extent,\u00a0Aedes albopictus.Dengue virus (DENV) has four serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4). Infection with one serotype provides long-term immunity to the homologous serotype but not to the other serotypes; sequential infections with a different serotype put people at greater risk for severe dengue. Many DENV infections produce only mild flu-like illness and over 80% of cases are asymptomatic.There is no specific treatment for dengue; however, the timely detection of cases, identifying any warning signs of severe dengue infection, and appropriate case management are key elements of care to lower case fatality rates to less than 1%.Dengue was first recorded in the 1960s in Bangladesh (then known as East Pakistan) and was known as \u201cDacca fever\u201d. Since 2010 cases of dengue appear to coincide with the rainy season from May to September and higher temperatures. Bangladesh\u2019s climate conditions are becoming more favorable for the transmission of dengue and other vector-borne diseases including malaria and chikungunya virus due to excessive rainfall, waterlogging, flooding, rise in temperature and the unusual shifts in the country\u2019s traditional seasons.",
        "Public Health Response": "The high number of reported cases has put pressure on the health systems and\u00a0the\u00a0Directorate General of Health Services has taken the following actions:CoordinationA coordination committee has been set up under the Director Disease Control & Line Director Communicable Disease Control (CDC) of the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) of Bangladesh\u00a0to oversee\u00a0the response.A Dengue Control Room has been formed (Secretariat) for coordination and data collection at the central level.\u00a0Additionally, there are Activated Control Rooms in all district and Medical College hospitals.Health system strengthening for case management:Six hospitals assigned for the management of COVID-19 patients in Dhaka city have been repurposed for dengue case management.\u00a0Additionally, dedicated dengue wards/dengue corners have been established in Medical College hospitals.\u00a0The fourth edition of the National Guideline for Clinical Management of Dengue Syndrome has been updated and instructions were given to all Government and Private Hospitals to follow the guideline.There is ongoing\u00a0capacity building on the clinical management of dengue for doctors and nurses across the country.\u00a0Pocket\u00a0guidelines for dengue have been distributed to health care staff.\u00a0Intravenous saline and other supportive medicines,\u00a0have been supplied to health facilities across the country.\u00a0Strengthening surveillance:The hospital-based surveillance system is actively collecting regular information from 57 hospitals in Dhaka city as well as all Upazila and district-level hospitals. Daily reports are also disseminated through the Health Emergency Operation Center (HEOC).\u00a0\u00a0Risk communication and community engagement:Mass awareness campaigns have been strengthened via television and other mass media methods including digital media, leaflets and posters. Community awareness is also provided by the local ward counsellors. The city corporations have informed all buildings under construction to prevent water collection and fines have been imposed on buildings where the\u00a0Aedes\u00a0larvae have been found.\u00a0Advocacy and awareness meetings are ongoing in highly affected wards of Dhaka city corporation by the Aedes Transmitted Disease Control Program and IHR, Migration Health, and Emerging Reemerging Disease Control Program under CDC-DGHS.\u00a0Laboratory:Dengue\u00a0serotyping\u00a0has been conducted.A total of\u00a0184 000 non-structural protein (NS1) diagnostic kits have been distributed to all Upazila health complexes, district hospitals and medical college hospitals.Vector control activities: The local government engineering department (LGED) is leading vector control activities including the elimination of mosquito breeding sites and larvicidal and adult mosquito control using different insecticides such as\u00a0Temephos and Deltamethrin.Post Monsoon Aedes Survey was carried out in all wards of Dhaka North and Dhaka South city corporation between 26 January 2023 to 4 February 2023. The results were disseminated to concerned stakeholders on 13 April 2023.A\u00a0Pre-Monsoon Aedes Survey started on 18 June 2023 and was completed on 27 June 2023. The results were disseminated to both city corporations on 4 July 2023.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Dengue is endemic in Bangladesh\u00a0with recurrent outbreaks and is one of the major public health concerns in Bangladesh.\u00a0Dengue virus has the potential to cause epidemics resulting in high morbidity and mortality.\u202fAll four serotypes of the dengue virus have been reported in Bangladesh with the predominance of DENV 1 and DENV2 until 2016. Since 2019, when the largest dengue outbreak was reported, DENV3 has been the predominant serotype, while this year DENV2 has become the predominant serotype.\u00a0\u00a0There is no specific treatment for cases and clinical management is based on supportive therapy however, the early\u00a0detection of infection and appropriate clinical management of patients can reduce the severity of disease and mortality The prevention and control of dengue depends on vector control.\u00a0A dengue\u00a0vaccine has not been approved in Bangladesh. The\u00a0dengue risk at the national level is assessed as \u2018High\u2019 due to the ongoing rapidly increasing number of cases and deaths with the peak not yet reached, the high CFR compared to the previous years and the increasing geographical distribution of cases. In addition, DENV2 has been identified as the predominant circulating serotype, following four years of DENV3 predominating which may result in higher numbers of severe cases as a result of a second infection with a heterologous serotype. Furthermore, there is some pressure on the healthcare capacity due to the very high number of admissions for dengue; high vector density; and an anticipated prolonged monsoon.Bangladesh has three international airports, three seaports and twenty-three land ports. Bangladesh shares 94% of its land border with India with frequent population movement across the land crossing, however, dengue is already endemic in India including the eastern Indian states which share land borders with Bangladesh and where Aedes mosquitoes breed and circulate. Climate change along with heavy rains in neighboring countries increase the likelihood of vector-borne disease transmission. Due to social and economic factors, many people migrate from Bangladesh to other countries thereby increasing the risk of international disease spread. Bangladesh receives a large volume of international tourists, and the possibility of travellers acquiring the disease and contributing to its further spread outside the country cannot be ruled out.",
        "WHO Advice": "The proximity of mosquito vector breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for\u00a0dengue virus infection. Aedes\u00a0species mosquitoes can become infected with the virus after biting\u00a0DENV-infected individuals and then pass the virus onto other individuals within the vicinity. This cycle, therefore, makes the infective mosquito capable of spreading the dengue virus within households and in the neighbourhood, leading to clusters of cases.\u00a0The prevention and control of the DENV, virus that causes dengue,\u00a0depends on effective vector control. Vector control activities should focus on all areas where there is a risk of human-vector contact such as the place of residence, workplaces, schools, and hospitals. WHO promotes a strategic approach known as Integrated Vector Management (IVM) to control mosquito vectors, including\u00a0Aedes\u00a0species, the vector of dengue. IVM should be enhanced to remove potential breeding sites, reduce vector populations, and minimize individual exposure. This should involve vector control strategies for larvae and adults (i.e. environmental management and source reduction, especially of water storage practices, and include covering, draining and cleaning household water storage containers on a weekly basis;\u00a0larvicide in non-potable water using WHO-prequalified larvicides at correct dosages,\u00a0distribution of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) for fever/dengue inpatients to contain spread of virus from health facilities, as well as strategies for protecting people and households. Indoor space spraying (fogging) is another approach for rapid containment of dengue\u00a0infected mosquitoes but may be challenging to deliver in densely populated areas such as camps.\u00a0Personal protective measures during outdoor activities include the topical application of repellents to exposed skin or treatment of clothing, and the use of long sleeves shirts and pants. Additionally, in indoors protection can include the use of household insecticide aerosol products, or mosquito coils during the day. Window and door screens, as well as air conditioning can reduce the probability of mosquitoes entering the house. Insecticide-treated nets offer good protection to people against mosquito bites while sleeping. Since\u00a0Aedes\u00a0mosquitoes (the primary vector for transmission) are active at dawn and dusk, personal protective measures are recommended particularly at these times of day.\u00a0Entomological surveillance should be undertaken to assess the breeding potential of\u00a0Aedes\u00a0mosquitoes in containers as well as to monitor insecticide resistance to help select most effective insecticide-based interventions. Insecticide resistance test kits produced by a WHO-coordinated facility in Universiti Sains Malaysia should be procured.There is no specific treatment for dengue infection, but early detection and access to\u00a0appropriate healthcare for case management can reduce mortality. Rapid detection of severe dengue cases and timely referrals to tertiary hospitals can reduce mortality. Case surveillance should continue to be enhanced in all affected areas and across the country. Where feasible, resources should be allocated for the strengthening of a sample referral mechanism for the confirmation and sub-typing of dengue virus.\u00a0WHO does not recommend that any general travel or trade restrictions be applied\u00a0to Bangladesh based on the information available for this event.",

        "Date Reported": "24 July 2023",
        "Location": "United Arab Emirates",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 10 July 2023, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), notified WHO of a case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in a 28-year-old male from Al Ain city in Abu Dhabi. The case had no history of direct or indirect contact with dromedaries, goats, or sheep. The patient was admitted to the hospital on 8 June. A nasopharyngeal swab was collected on 21 June and tested positive for MERS-CoV by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on 23 June 2023. All 108 identified contacts were monitored for 14 days from the last date of exposure to the MERS-CoV patient. No secondary cases have been detected to date.\nSince July 2013, when the UAE reported the first case of MERS-CoV, 94 confirmed cases (including this new case) and 12 deaths have been reported. Globally, the total number of confirmed MERS-CoV cases reported to WHO since 2012 is 2605, including 936 associated deaths.\nWHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessments based on the latest available information. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East and/or other countries where MERS-CoV is circulating in dromedaries.\nWHO re-emphasizes the importance of strong surveillance by all Member States for acute respiratory infections, including MERS-CoV, and to carefully review any unusual patterns.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 10 July 2023, the International Health Regulations National Focal Point (IHR NFP) of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) notified WHO of a confirmed case of MERS-CoV in Abu Dhabi. The patient is\u00a0a 28-year-old male, non- Emirati national living in Al Ain city, a non-healthcare worker. \u00a0The case visited a private medical center multiple times between 3 and 7 June 2023, complaining of vomiting, right flank pain, and dysuria (pain when passing urine). On 8 June, the case presented to a government hospital with vomiting, and gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhea, and was given an initial diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, acute kidney injury, and sepsis. On 13 June, he was in critical condition and referred to an intensive care unit (ICU) at a specialized government tertiary hospital where he was put on mechanical ventilation. He deteriorated and a nasopharyngeal swab was collected on 21 June and tested positive for MERS-CoV by PCR on 23 June 2023.The case has no known co-morbidities, no history of contact with MERS-CoV human cases, and no recent travel outside the UAE. The patient has no known history of direct contact with animals including dromedary camels, nor consumption of their raw products. All 108 contacts that were identified have been monitored for 14 days from the last date of exposure to the MERS-CoV patient, no secondary case was identified. The case has no family members or household contacts identified in the UAE.Prior to this notification, the last MERS-CoV infection reported from the UAE was in November 2021. The first laboratory-confirmed case of MERS-CoV in UAE was in July 2013. Since then, the UAE has reported 94 cases of MERS-CoV (including this current case) and 12 associated deaths (Case Fatality Ratio (CFR): 13%).",
        "Epidemiology": "Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory infection that is caused by a coronavirus called Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedary camels who are the natural host and zoonotic source of the MERS-CoV infection.MERS-CoV infections range from asymptomatic or mild respiratory symptoms to severe acute respiratory disease and death. A typical presentation of a person with MERS-CoV disease is fever, cough and shortness of breath. Pneumonia is a common finding, but not always present. Gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhoea, have also been reported. The virus appears to cause more severe disease in older people, persons with weakened immune systems and those with chronic diseases such as renal disease, cancer, chronic lung disease, and diabetes. Severe illness can cause respiratory failure that requires mechanical ventilation and support in an intensive care unit resulting in high mortality.No vaccine or specific treatment is currently available, although several MERS-CoV-specific vaccines and treatments are in development. Treatment is supportive and based on the patient\u2019s clinical condition.",
        "Public Health Response": "A total of 108 contacts from health care facilities were identified and screened for MERS-CoV (56 from the first government hospital and 52 from the second government hospital) all of which were health care workers (HCWs), screening for exposed HCWs was repeated by respiratory samples, all results were negative.All 108 identified contacts were monitored for 14 days from the last date of exposure to the MERS-CoV patient, and no secondary cases have been detected to date.Abu Dhabi Public Health Centre (ADPHC) has updated the case definition for MERS-CoV, strengthened surveillance activities to identify possible cases, conducted several workshops and issued circulars for MERS-CoV.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory infection of humans and dromedary camels which is caused by a coronavirus called the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease in humans resulting in high mortality. Approximately 35% of patients with MERS-CoV have died, but this may be an overestimate of the true mortality rate, as mild cases of MERS-CoV may be missed by existing surveillance systems. Until more is known about the disease, the case fatality rates are counted only amongst the laboratory-confirmed cases reported to WHO. Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedaries, a host and zoonotic source of MERS-CoV infection. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to be transmitted between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts and in healthcare settings.\u00a0Outside of the healthcare setting, there has been limited human-to-human transmission. Cases of MERS-CoV infection are rare in the UAE. Since July 2013, a total of 94 MERS-CoV cases, including this current case, resulting in 12 deaths (CFR 13%) have been reported to WHO from the UAE.Globally, the total number of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases reported to WHO since 2012 is 2605, including 936 associated deaths as of July 2023. The majority of the reported cases have occurred in countries in the Arabian Peninsula. Outside of this region, there has been one large outbreak in the Republic of Korea, in May 2015, during which 186 laboratory-confirmed cases (185 in the Republic of Korea and one in China) and 38 deaths were reported. The global number reflects the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths reported to WHO under IHR (2005) to date.The notification of this case does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East and/or other countries where MERS-CoV is circulating in dromedaries, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who were exposed to the virus through contact with dromedaries or their products (for example, consumption of camel\u2019s raw milk), or in a healthcare setting. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessments based on the latest available information.",
        "WHO Advice": "Based on the current situation and available information, WHO re-emphasizes the importance of strong surveillance by all Member States for acute respiratory infections, including MERS-CoV, and to carefully review any unusual patterns.Given that this latest case presents with severe disease but has no comorbidities and no exposure history to camels, camel raw products or MERS-CoV human case, it will be important to sequence the virus and conduct genomic analysis to screen for any unusual patterns. The process for genomic analysis has begun. This will identify any genetic evolution of the virus and support WHO\u2019s global risk assessment efforts.\u00a0 As a general precaution, anyone visiting farms, markets, barns or other places where dromedaries are present should practice general hygiene measures, including regular hand washing after touching animals, avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with hands, and avoiding contact with sick animals. People may also consider wearing protective gowns and gloves while professionally handling animals.The consumption of raw or undercooked animal products, including milk, meat, blood and urine, carries a high risk of infection from a variety of organisms that might cause disease in humans. Animal products processed appropriately through proper cooking or pasteurization are safe for consumption but should also be handled carefully to avoid cross-contamination with uncooked foods. Human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV in healthcare settings has been associated with delays in recognizing the early symptoms of MERS-CoV infection, slow triage of suspected cases and delays in implementing infection, prevention and control (IPC) measures. IPC measures are therefore critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV between people in health-care facilities. Health -care facilities should ensure environmental and engineering controls are in place including adequate ventilation, spatial separation of at least one meter between patients and others, including health and care workers and adequate environmental cleaning. Health care workers should consistently apply standard precautions to all patients at every interaction in healthcare settings. Droplet precautions, including eye protection, should be applied in addition to standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol-generating procedures or in settings where aerosol-generating procedures are conducted. Early identification, case management and isolation of cases, quarantine of contacts, appropriate infection prevention and control measures in health care settings, and public health awareness can prevent human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV.MERS-CoV appears to cause more severe disease in people with underlying chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and in immunocompromised persons. Therefore, people with these underlying medical conditions should avoid close contact with animals, particularly dromedaries, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.",

        "Location": "the Region of the Americas",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "Since the beginning of 2023, dengue outbreaks of significant magnitude have been recorded in the WHO Region of the Americas, with close to three million suspected and confirmed cases of dengue reported so far this year, surpassing the 2.8 million cases of dengue registered for the entire year of 2022. Of the total number of dengue cases reported until 1 July 2023 (2 997 097 cases), 45% were laboratory confirmed, and 0.13% were classified as severe dengue. The highest number of dengue cases to date in 2023 are in Brazil, Peru, and Bolivia. Additionally, 1302 deaths were reported in the Region with a Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of 0.04%, in the same period.\nAs part of the implementation of the Integrated Management Strategy for the Prevention and Control of Arboviral Diseases (IMS-Arbovirus), WHO is actively working with the Member States to strengthen healthcare and surveillance capacity.\nWHO has assessed the risk of dengue as high at the regional level due to the wide spread distribution of the Aedes spp. mosquitoes (especially Aedes aegypti), the continued risk of severe disease and death, and the expansion out of historical areas of transmission, where all the population, including risk groups and healthcare workers, may not be aware of warning signs.\nWHO does not recommend any travel and/or trade restrictions for countries in the Americas experiencing the current dengue epidemics based on the currently available information.",
        "Description of the Situation": "Dengue is the arbovirus that causes the highest number of cases in the Region of the Americas, with epidemics occurring cyclically every 3 to 5 years. During the first half of 2023, dengue outbreaks of significant magnitude were recorded in South America.\u00a0 Between epidemiological week (EW) 1 and EW 26 of 2023 (week ending on 01 July), a total of 2 997 097 cases of dengue were reported in the Region of the Americas, including 1302 deaths with a CFR of 0.04%, with a cumulative incidence rate of 305 cases per 100 000 population. Of the total number of dengue cases until EW 26 of 2023, 1 348 234 (45%) were laboratory confirmed, and 3907 (0.13%) were classified as severe dengue.1 The highest number of dengue cases was observed in Brazil, with 2 376 522 cases, followed by Peru with 188 326 cases, and Bolivia with 133 779 cases.The highest cumulative incidence rates were observed in the following subregions: the Southern Cone2 with 862 cases per 100 000 inhabitants, the Andean Subregion3 with 268 cases per 100 000 inhabitants, and the Central American Isthmus and Mexico4 with 59 cases per 100 000 inhabitants.The highest number of severe dengue cases was observed in the following countries: Brazil with 1249 cases, Peru with 701 cases, Colombia with 683 cases, Bolivia with 591 cases and Mexico with 141 cases. All four dengue virus serotypes (DENV1, DENV2, DENV3, and DENV4) are present in the Region of the Americas. In 2023, up to EW 26 (ending on 1 July), simultaneous circulation of all four serotypes has been detected in Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, and Venezuela; while in Argentina, Panama, Peru, and Puerto Rico, DENV1, DENV2 and DENV3 serotypes circulate, and in Nicaragua the serotypes DENV1, DENV3 and DENV4.In 2022, 2 811 433 dengue cases were reported in the Region of the Americas, the third highest year on record, only surpassed by 2016 and 2019. In 2019, the highest number of historical dengue cases was registered, with more than 3.1 million cases for the Region of the Americas, including 28 203 severe cases and 1823 deaths.Between 12 June to 1 July 2023, some countries in the Southern Cone and the Andean subregion have been showing a decrease in the number of cases due to multiple factors, including, the implementation of control measures, and the change in temperature and climate, mainly in the Southern Cone. There is also a delay in the notification of data from some countries in Central America and the Caribbean. These have resulted in a decline in cases and the downward trend observed in the epidemiological curve below. Figure 1.

        "Epidemiology": "Dengue is a viral infection that spreads from mosquitoes to people. It is more common in tropical and subtropical climates. Most people who get dengue won\u2019t have symptoms. But for those that do, the most common symptoms are high fever, headache, body aches, nausea and rash. Most people will get better in 1\u20132 weeks, however, some people develop severe dengue which includes shock or respiratory distress due to plasma leakage, severe bleeding, organ impairment, and death.In severe cases, dengue can be fatal. The risk of dengue can be avoided by avoiding mosquito bites especially during the day. There is currently no specific treatment for dengue, therefore, case management focuses on managing pain symptoms with Acetaminophen. Some of the severe cases are secondary infections (people getting infected for a second time with another serotype).The incidence of dengue has grown dramatically around the world in recent decades, with cases reported to WHO increasing from 505\u00a0430 cases in 2000 to 5.2\u00a0million in 2019 globally. A vast majority of cases are asymptomatic or mild and self-managed, and hence the actual numbers of dengue cases are under-reported. Many cases are also misdiagnosed as other febrile illnesses.The disease is now endemic in more than 100 countries in the WHO Regions of Africa, the Americas, the Eastern Mediterranean, South-East Asia and the Western Pacific. The Americas, South-East Asia and Western Pacific regions are the most seriously affected, with Asia representing around 70% of the global disease burden.The largest number of dengue cases ever reported globally was in 2019. All regions were affected, and dengue transmission was recorded in Afghanistan for the first time.\u00a0The American Region reported 3.1\u00a0million cases, with more than 25\u00a0000 classified as severe. A high number of cases were reported in Bangladesh (101\u00a0000), Malaysia (131\u00a0000) Philippines (420\u00a0000), and Vietnam (320\u00a0000).",
        "Public Health Response": "Ministry of Health (MoH) response:Regular meetings with national and subnational health authorities. Some countries have implemented Emergency Center Operations (EOC) for a suitable outbreak response.Strengthened surveillance activities for early detection of cases.Strengthened vector-control activities in affected areas.Strengthening of the laboratory network.Trained healthcare professionals in the detection of warning signals of severe dengue.Facilitated awareness raising among health workers (by sharing factsheets and surveillance tools) and to the local population using risk communication messages.\u00a0Some countries have national networks of clinical experts in arboviral diseases under the direction of the Ministries of Health in each country, which are responsible for conducting clinical training at the local level.WHO response:As part of the implementation of the Integrated Management Strategy for the Prevention and Control of Arboviral Diseases (IMS-Arbovirus), WHO is actively working with the Member States so that they can strengthen healthcare and surveillance capacity.WHO has been supporting Member States in preparedness and response to possible outbreaks, including the organization of health services.WHO is supporting the implementation of effective integrated vector surveillance and control by Member States through publishing guidelines and the provision of epidemiological surveillance materials and technical assistance to national authorities. \u00a0\u00a0WHO is supporting the increase of laboratory-capacity to enable timely and accurate diagnosis and case detection throughout the region.WHO is supporting health care workers capacity building through case management recommendations and clinical care training.WHO experts are being deployed to countries that are experiencing high-magnitude outbreaks.\u00a0In 2020, WHO began a collaboration with the Andean Health Organization-Hip\u00f3lito Unanue Agreement (ORAS-CONHU) to strengthen national technical capacities for the prevention and control of arboviral diseases in Bolivia, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela. This collaboration falls under the framework of the Integrated Management Strategy for the Prevention and Control of Arboviral Diseases, approved by WHO.Virtual cooperation spaces (VCS) have been created as an effort of collaborative surveillance between WHO and the Member States that allow the automated generation of different epidemiological analyses, situation rooms, and epidemiological bulletins, strengthening the epidemiological surveillance of dengue and other arboviruses.WHO also provides advice on risk assessment and risk communication.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Dengue is a mosquito - borne viral disease (arbovirus) that has the potential to cause serious public health impact. The virus that causes this infection has been circulating in the region of the Americas for decades10\u00a0due to the widespread distribution of the\u00a0Aedes\u00a0spp. mosquitoes (mainly\u00a0Aedes aegypti), with epidemics occurring cyclically every 3 to 5 years. Several dengue outbreaks have been documented previously in the Region. This arbovirus can be carried by infected travellers (imported cases) and may establish new areas of local transmission in the presence of vectors and a susceptible population. As they are arboviruses, all populations living in areas with the presence of\u00a0Aedes aegypti\u00a0are at risk, however, their impact largely affects the most vulnerable people, in which the arboviral disease programs do not have enough resources to respond to outbreaks.The consequences of the current high transmission scenario depend on several factors, including the current capacities for a coordinated public health response and clinical management, the early start of the arbovirus season in the southern hemisphere, high mosquito densities and the possible impact of climate change and El Nino phenomenon in the southern hemisphere, lack of vector surveillance and control activities during the COVID-19 pandemic and high proportion of the susceptible population for arboviruses in the region. The current high transmission scenario for dengue occurs in the context of other ongoing outbreaks and emergencies. The synergic effects of concurrent emergencies may hinder the health system\u2019s capacity to respond to an epidemic of arboviral diseases and therefore affect disease control and proper clinical management, including, but not limited to (i) misdiagnosis, given that \u00a0dengue symptoms may be non-specific and resemble other infections, including chikungunya, Zika and measles, potentially leading to inadequate case management;\u00a0 (ii) overwhelmed healthcare facilities in some areas given high caseload, as well as other concurrent outbreaks of other communicable diseases; and (iii) the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the decrease of available resources to arboviral disease programs and the need for capacity building and training of vector-control and healthcare workers, as well as maintenance and procurement of equipment and insecticides to perform vector control activities.Dengue is endemic in most countries of South America. However, during the seasonal period in the first half of 2023, where dengue outbreaks have been detected, there has been an increase in the number of cases at levels above the average number of cases recorded in the last five years and the expansion of dengue out of historical areas of transmission.Aedes\u00a0spp. mosquitoes are widely distributed in the Region of the Americas, therefore, dengue international spread is likely. Additionally, it is expected that in the second half of 2023, some countries in the Region, especially in Central America and the Caribbean, will have an increase in rainfall, which, depending on its magnitude and impact on dengue-endemic areas, could increase the incidence of the disease and constitute an additional burden of arboviral diseases for health systems in affected areas.The risk at the regional level is assessed as high due to the widely spread distribution of the vector (especially\u00a0Aedes aegypti), the continued risk of severe disease and even death, and the expansion out of historical areas of transmission, where all the population, including risk groups and healthcare workers, may not be aware of warning signs.Information on the circulating dengue virus serotype is limited. It is expected that a large proportion of the population in these areas is na\u00efve to the current virus circulating, which may lead to outbreaks. Moreover, people in these areas may not be aware of warning signs, and the population might delay seeking health care.In some areas, there is a lack of medical facilities with limited geographical access, making it difficult for people to access basic health care. Especially in these areas, people tend to self-medicate, and in dengue cases ibuprofen, acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are contraindicated because they can aggravate gastritis or bleeding and lead to increased mortality risk. \u00a0Other challenges reported by Member States in the Region include but are not limited to stockouts of several essential supplies for prevention and control, lack of reagents and consumables for laboratory diagnosis, and the need for re-training field teams and health workers. In addition, higher transmission rates are expected in the following months due to favourable weather conditions to vector activity in the second half of the year in Central America and the northern hemisphere.",
        "WHO Advice": "Dengue is caused by the dengue virus (DENV), an RNA virus of the family\u00a0Flaviviridae. There are four distinct but closely related serotypes of the virus (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4) - recovery from infection provides lifelong immunity against that serotype. Although most cases of dengue are mild, the sequential infection by more than one serotype increases the risk of developing severe dengue, which includes shock or respiratory distress due to plasma leakage, severe bleeding, organ impairment, and death.Prevention efforts are highly focused on the surveillance and control of\u00a0Aedes\u00a0spp. mosquitoes (the most competent vector in the region). Since vector surveillance and control may be difficult to sustain, especially in areas where DENV is endemic year-round, early detection of severe disease progression and access to proper medical attention is key to lowering severe case rates and, therefore, case fatality rates. Personal protection and source reduction measures should be maintained by communities both at places of work or study and at homes. No specific antiviral treatment exists for chikungunya and dengue. Clinical management is based on supportive care, including fluids and antipyretics; recovery can provide\u00a0\u00a0 immunity (for that specific serotype in dengue cases). As symptoms of these arboviruses may overlap, clinical-epidemiological diagnostic may be challenging, and there is cross-reactivity of the immunoglobulin M and G antibodies (IgM and IgG) of dengue and Zika viruses, hindering accurate diagnosis, which can lead to inadequate case management, and compromising efficient epidemiological surveillance. The reason why molecular diagnosis with RT-PCR is recommended.It is very important that the Member States in the Americas are extremely vigilant and prepared to intensify actions to prevent, early detect, diagnose, and control arboviruses, including training and alerting healthcare workers on the detection of cases and potential complications of these diseases, identification of risk groups for severe disease, appropriate clinical management and follow up of cases to prevent future deaths. \u00a0In the second half of 2023, an increase in dengue cases is expected. Targeted integrated vector surveillance, monitoring insecticide resistance in dengue vector and control measures are helpful in reducing transmission rates. As a general precaution, WHO recommends avoidance of mosquito bites, including the use of repellents. The highest risk for transmission of dengue is during the day and early evening.WHO reiterates to all Member States the importance of strengthening: 1) their laboratory capacity to recognize and confirm the cases timely; 2) their healthcare capacity to rapidly detect and manage cases, and 3) their surveillance capacity to rapidly detect trends on the incidence and implement control measures. It is relevant to maintain close monitoring of the situation in the region with active cross-border coordination and information sharing because of the possibility of cases in neighbouring countries.WHO does not recommend any travel and/or trade restrictions for countries in the Americas experiencing the current dengue epidemics based on the currently available information.",

        "Outbreak name": "Influenza A(H5N1) in cats",
        "Date Reported": "16 July 2023",
        "Location": "Poland",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 27 June 2023, the IHR National Focal Point of Poland notified WHO of unusual deaths in cats across the country. As of 11 July, 47 samples have been tested from 46 cats and one captive caracal, of which 29 were found to be positive for influenza A (H5N1). Fourteen cats are reported to have been euthanized, and a further 11 died, with the last death reported on 30 June. The source of the exposure of cats to the virus is currently unknown and epizootic investigations are ongoing.\nSporadic infection of cats with A(H5N1) has previously been reported, but this is the first report of a high numbers of infected cats over a wide geographical area within a country.\nAs of 12 July, no human contacts of A(H5N1) positive cats have reported symptoms, and the surveillance period for all contacts is now complete.\nThe risk of human infections following exposure to infected cats at the national level is assessed as low for the general population, and low to moderate for cat owners and those occupationally exposed to H5N1-infected cats (such as veterinarians) without the use of appropriate personal protective equipment.\nWHO continues to monitor the situation and work in close collaboration with the animal and public health sectors, regional agencies, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH), and other partner agencies in Poland.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 27 June 2023, the IHR National Focal Point of Poland notified WHO of unusual deaths in cats across the country. As of 11 July 2023, a total of 47 samples have been tested from 46 cats and one caracal (Caracal caracal). Of these 47 samples, 29 (62%) were positive for influenza A(H5N1). Positive samples were reported from 13 geographical areas within the country. Some cats developed severe symptoms including difficulty in breathing, bloody diarrhoea, and neurological signs, with rapid deterioration and death in some cases. In total, 20 cats had neurological signs, 19 had respiratory signs, and 17 had both neurological and respiratory signs.\u00a0 Fourteen cats are reported to have been euthanized, and a further 11 died.\u00a0 Post-mortem exams on a small number of cats are suggestive of pneumonia. According to the information available, the last known death among cats was reported on 30 June .Genomic analysis of 19 viruses sequenced from this outbreak showed that they all belonged to the H5 clade 2.3.4.4b and were highly related to each other. Also, the viruses are similar to influenza A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b viruses which have been circulating in wild birds and which caused outbreaks in poultry recently in Poland.\u00a0 The source of exposure of cats to the virus is currently unknown and epizootic investigations are ongoing. There are several possibilities for the source of infection, among which the cats could have had direct or indirect contact with infected birds or their environments, ate infected birds, or ate food contaminated with the virus. Authorities are investigating all potential sources and to date have not ruled out any. Of the 25 cats for which the information is available, two were outdoor cats, 18 were indoor with access to a balcony, terrace, or backyard, and five were indoor cats with no access to the outside environment. Seven cats are reported to have had the opportunity for contact with wild birds.\u00a0 This is the first report of high numbers of cats infected with avian influenza A(H5N1) spread over a wide geographical area within any country.\u00a0 Sporadic infections in domestic cats with A(H5N1) viruses, including A(H5N1) H5 clade 2.3.4.4b viruses, have been reported previously, following close contact of the cats with infected birds or from ingesting meat of infected birds.",
        "Epidemiology": "Since the end of 2021, an unprecedented number of H5N1 outbreaks among poultry and wild birds has been reported worldwide. As of June 2023, the clade 2.3.4.4b viruses have become dominant in Asia, Europe, the Americas and Africa. Alongside wild bird and domestic poultry infections, there have been increased detections in non-avian species, including wild terrestrial (often scavenging) and marine mammals and occasionally in farmed or captive mammalian species, likely through contact with infected live or dead birds or their environments.\u00a0Since 2020, 12 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b virus detections have been reported to WHO, four of which were severe cases and eight were mild or asymptomatic. It is unclear if the detection of the virus in these mild or asymptomatic cases resulted from infection or temporary contamination of the nasal passages. Most humans infected with A(H5N1) viruses have resulted from direct or indirect contact with infected live or dead poultry. Human infection with influenza A(H5N1) viruses can cause severe disease and is fatal in some cases.",
        "Public Health Response": "Response measures have been implemented by the national authorities in Poland. These include:Under the guidance of the public health authorities in Poland, all owners of infected cats are provided with a health self-assessment questionnaire and requested to self-monitor for symptoms of influenza-like illness (ILI) or acute respiratory illness (ARI) for 10 days since last contact with infected cat. As of 12 July, 70 individuals who had been in contact with confirmed cats have completed self-monitoring and none reported symptoms. \u00a0\u00a0Providing regular updates on the situation and sharing information and updates with partners, including international organizations. Epizootic investigations are underway to understand the epidemiological situation in cats and the likely source of exposure of cats to the virus. Preventive measures have been taken to prevent the occurrence of disease in humans by issuing publicly available general precautions for cat owners and individuals who have contact with sick animals suspected of avian influenza infection.\u00a0WHO continues to monitor the situation and work in close collaboration with the animal and public health sectors, regional agencies, FAO, WOAH, and other partner agencies in Poland and globally.WHO is evaluating the existing candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs) of A(H5N1) through the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) to ensure valid CVVs are developed and available for pandemic preparedness purposes.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "To date, human A(H5N1) infections following contact with an infected cat have not been documented. Avian Influenza A(H5N1) virus detections in humans remain unusual, and sustained human-to-human transmission has not been documented. To date, no symptomatic human contact of infected cats has been reported in Poland despite potentially close contact between cats and owners, \u00a0and the capacity to detect a human case in contact with an infected cat is adequate in the country.\u00a0  Therefore, based on current information, the risk of human infections following exposure to infected cats at the national level is assessed as low for the general population, and low to moderate for cat owners and those occupationally exposed to A(H5N1)-infected cats (such as veterinarians) without the use of appropriate personal protective equipment. Based on the current information, the risk for humans at the regional level is assessed as low, due to: i) avian influenza surveillance activities in animals in Europe being strengthened since September 2022, when the unprecedented geographical extent (37 European countries affected) resulted in 50 million poultry being culled in affected establishments; and (ii) Currently, there are no reported instances of human infection with the A(H5N1) virus acquired from cats, although A(H5N1) infection in domestic cats has been confirmed in Poland.  Due to the uncertainties related to this event, including the source of infection, the risk assessment may change.",
        "WHO Advice": "The reports of these events do not change the current WHO recommendations on public health measures and surveillance of influenza.Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect and monitor virological, epidemiological and clinical changes associated with emerging or circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health and timely virus-sharing for risk assessment.All individuals exposed to animal influenza viruses, and all contacts of confirmed human cases, should monitor their health for the duration of the known exposure period with additional seven days at a minimum. All those exposed to known infected poultry, wild birds or other animals, or to farms under suspicion, should be registered and placed under close monitoring by local health authorities. This will facilitate the early detection of illness and timely clinical case management. If a person is suspected of having zoonotic influenza, the health authorities must be notified, and appropriate clinical case management should be provided.Public health and animal health authorities should collaborate closely in the areas of information sharing, joint risk assessment, and response to outbreaks of zoonotic influenza at the human-animal interface, adhering to the One Health approach.FAO, WHO and WOAH have issued a joint situation analysis and advice to countries in relation to ongoing avian influenza outbreaks in animals and the risk posed to human health.\u00a0 FAO, WHO and WOAH continue to review the situation, monitoring the rapidly evolving nature of the virus, and updating recommendations for curbing its spread, in addition to working with countries in preparedness and response, and facilitating collaboration across countries and sectors. The spread of the virus to five continents speaks to the need for global cooperation and alertness to protect animals, people, and economies.WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel and/or trade with Poland based on available information on this event.",

        "Outbreak name": "Influenza A H1N1 variant virus",
        "Date Reported": "16 June 2023",
        "Location": "Brazil",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 7 June 2023, Brazil notified the World Health Organization (WHO) of a fatal laboratory-confirmed human case of infection with a swine-origin influenza A(H1N1) variant (v) virus in the inner state of Paran\u00e1.\nSporadic human cases of influenza A(H1N1)v have been reported previously, including from Brazil. According to the International Health Regulations (IHR) 2005, a human infection caused by a novel influenza A virus subtype is an event that has the potential for high public health impact and must be notified to the WHO.\nBased on the information currently available, WHO considers this a sporadic case, and there is no evidence of person-to-person transmission of this event. The likelihood of community-level spread among humans and/or international disease spread through humans is low.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 7 June 2023, the Brazil IHR National Focal Point (NFP) notified WHO of a fatal human infection caused by a swine-origin influenza A(H1N1)v virus detected by the National Influenza Centre (NIC), Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro.The patient was a 42-year-old woman with underlying medical conditions who lived near a swine farm. She developed fever, headache, sore throat, and abdominal pain on 1 May 2023 and was hospitalized on 3 May with a severe acute respiratory infection. On 4 May, the patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and she passed away on 5 May.Ongoing investigations reported that the patient did not have any direct contact with pigs, however, two of her close contacts worked at the swine farm. The two contacts did not develop respiratory disease and tested negative for influenza. To date, no human-to-human transmission associated with this case has been identified.\u00a0During hospitalization, a nasopharyngeal swab sample was collected from the patient for influenza and SARS-CoV-2 testing, as part of regular respiratory virus surveillance activities. Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) was conducted at the State of Paran\u00e1 Central Public Health Laboratory, where the sample was subtyped as an influenza A/H1 virus. The sample also tested positive for a swine influenza A virus marker by RT-PCR.\u00a0The specimen was forwarded to the National Influenza Centre Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, in Rio de Janeiro, where further complementary analyses and genomic sequencing were performed. Samples received at the NIC on 25 May were confirmed to be an influenza A(H1N1)v virus by sequence analysis on 30 May. The recovered genome has a high identity (99%) with the haemagglutinin (HA) of other Influenza A(H1N1)v viruses previously detected in the municipality of Toledo state of Paran\u00e1 in 2022. In addition, it has 96% identity with the HA of viruses collected from pigs in Brazil in 2015.On 8 June, after the Brazilian Ministry of Health (MoH) notified WHO under the IHR, the NIC started the process to send the patient's samples to the WHO Collaborating Centre at the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC) for further characterization.",
        "Epidemiology": "Influenza A(H1) viruses are enzootic in swine populations in most regions of the world. When an influenza virus that normally circulates in swine is detected in a person, it is called a \u201cvariant influenza virus\u201d. H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2 are major subtypes of swine influenza A viruses in pigs and occasionally infect humans, usually after direct or indirect exposure to pigs or contaminated environments.Human infections with variant viruses tend to result in mild clinical illness, although some cases have been hospitalized with more severe disease and some have been fatal.To date, sporadic human infections caused by influenza A(H1N1)v and A(H1N2)v viruses have been reported in Brazil, and there has been no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission.This is the first human infection caused by an influenza A(H1N1)v virus reported in 2023 in Brazil, and the third human infection reported in the state of Parana (the first was detected in 2021 and the second in 2022).",
        "Public Health Response": "Local and national health authorities implemented the following public health measures:Conducting further epidemiological investigations, and follow-up of contacts in the family, community, and health care facilities.Monitoring the surveillance of influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) in the surrounding municipalities (within the same health region), particularly influenza virus, seeking to analyze the behavior and trends of respiratory viruses in the region.Reinforcing the vaccination campaign for seasonal influenza in at-risk groups.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "This is a sporadic case based on currently available information and further spread has not been detected.Limited, non-sustained human-to-human transmission of variant influenza viruses has been described, although ongoing community transmission has not been identified. Current evidence suggests that these viruses have not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans.There is no vaccine for Influenza A(H1N1)v infection currently licensed for use in humans. Seasonal influenza vaccines against human influenza viruses are generally not expected to protect people from influenza viruses that normally circulate in pigs, but they can reduce the likelihood of getting sick with both human and variant influenza viruses.WHO assesses the risk of international disease spread through humans and/or community-level spread among humans posed by this event as low. The risk level will be amended if warranted by the investigations currently being conducted by national authorities.",
        "WHO Advice": "Surveillance:This case does not change the current WHO recommendations on public health measures and surveillance of seasonal influenza.Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect virological, epidemiological and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health and timely virus sharing for risk assessment.Continued vigilance is needed within affected and neighboring areas to detect infections in animals and humans. Collaboration between the animal and human health sectors is essential. As the extent of influenza viruses circulating in animals is unclear, epidemiologic and virologic surveillance and the follow-up of suspected human cases should continue systematically. Guidance on the investigation of non-seasonal influenza and other emerging acute respiratory diseases is available on the WHO website.Vigilance for the emergence of novel influenza viruses of pandemic potential should be maintained. WHO has developed practical guidance for integrated surveillance in the context of the cocirculation of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses.It is critical that influenza viruses from animals or from people are fully characterized in appropriate animal or human health influenza reference laboratories. Under WHO\u2019s Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework, Member States are expected to share influenza viruses with pandemic potential on a regular and timely basis with the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS).Notification and investigation:All human infections caused by a novel influenza subtype are notifiable under the IHR, and State Parties to the IHR are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic. Evidence of illness is not required for this report.In the case of a confirmed or suspected human infection caused by a novel influenza virus with pandemic potential, including a variant virus, a thorough epidemiologic investigation of history of exposure to animals, of travel, and contact tracing should be conducted. The epidemiologic investigation should include early identification of unusual respiratory events that could indicate person-to-person transmission of the novel virus. Clinical samples collected from the time and place that the case occurred should be tested and sent to a WHO Collaboration Centre for further characterization.Travel and trade:WHO does not recommend any travel and/or trade restrictions for Brazil based on available information on this event.Prevention measures for travelers: WHO advises that travelers to countries with known outbreaks of animal influenza should avoid farms, contact with animals in live animal markets, entering areas where animals may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with animal excreta. Travelers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. All individuals should follow good food safety and hygiene practices.WHO does not advise special traveler screening at points of entry or restrictions with regard to the current situation of influenza viruses at the human-animal interface.",

        "Date Reported": "9 June 2023",
        "Location": "Equatorial Guinea",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 8 June 2023, after two consecutive incubation periods (42 days) without a new confirmed case reported, the Ministry of Health of Equatorial Guinea declared the end of the Marburg virus disease (MVD) outbreak, as per the WHO recommendations. A total of 17 confirmed and 23 probable cases were reported from five districts in four provinces; 12 of the 17 confirmed cases died and all of the probable cases were reported deaths.\nWHO and partners provided technical support to the government to contain this outbreak through its country office.\nWHO encourages maintaining most response activities for three months after the outbreak ends. This is to make sure that if the disease re-emerges, health authorities are able to detect it immediately, prevent the disease from spreading again, and ultimately save lives.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 13 February 2023, the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare of Equatorial Guinea declared an outbreak of MVD after suspected viral hemorrhagic fever deaths were reported between 7 January and 7 February 2023, and a case tested positive on 12 February for Marburg virus by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at the Institut Pasteur de Dakar in Senegal.From the outbreak declaration until 7 June 2023, 17 confirmed and 23 probable cases were reported in the continental region of Equatorial Guinea. Twelve of the confirmed cases died and all of the probable cases were reported deaths (the case fatality ratio among confirmed cases is 75%, excluding one confirmed case with an unknown outcome).The last confirmed case admitted to a Marburg treatment center in Bata district in Litoral province was discharged on 26 April, after two consecutive negative PCR tests for MVD. On 8 June 2023, after two consecutive incubation periods (42 days) without a new confirmed case reported, the Ministry of Health of Equatorial Guinea declared the end of the outbreak.Confirmed or probable cases were reported in five districts (Bata, Ebebiyin, Evinayong, Nsok Nsomo and Nsork) in four of the country\u2019s eight provinces (Centro Sur, Ki\u00e9-Ntem, Litoral and Wele-Nzas).Five cases (31%) were identified among healthcare workers, of whom two died (CFR among HCWs: 40%).Four patients recovered and were enrolled in a survivor care programme to receive psychosocial and other post-recovery support.Figure 1. MVD cases by week of symptoms onset* and case classification, Equatorial Guinea, as of 7 June 2023.Figure 2. Map of districts reporting MVD confirmed and probable cases during the outbreak, Equatorial Guinea.",
        "Epidemiology": "Marburg virus spreads between people via direct contact through broken skin or mucous membranes with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people, and with surfaces and materials such as bedding, and clothing contaminated with these fluids. Healthcare workers have previously been infected while treating suspected or confirmed MVD patients. Burial ceremonies that involve direct contact with the body of the deceased can also contribute to the transmission of Marburg virus.The incubation period varies from two to 21 days. Illness caused by Marburg virus begins abruptly, with high fever, severe headache, and severe malaise. Severe haemorrhagic manifestations may appear between five and seven days from symptom onset, although not all cases have haemorrhagic signs, and fatal cases usually have some form of bleeding, often from multiple areas.Although no vaccines or antiviral treatments are approved to treat the virus, Remdesivir was used in this outbreak on compassionate care basis. Supportive care \u2013 rehydration with oral or intravenous fluids \u2013 and treatment of specific symptoms improve survival. A range of potential treatments are being evaluated, including blood products, immune therapies, and drug therapies.This was the first documented outbreak of MVD reported in Equatorial Guinea. Another MVD outbreak was recently declared over in the United Republic of Tanzania (for more information, see the\u00a0Disease Outbreak News published on 2 June 2023). MVD outbreaks have been previously reported in Ghana (2022), Guinea (2021), Uganda (2017, 2014, 2012, 2007), Angola (2004-2005), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (1998 and 2000), Kenya (1990, 1987, 1980) and South Africa (1975).",
        "Public Health Response": "Coordination Following the official outbreak declaration in the country, the Government of Equatorial Guinea established an emergency response structure to manage the response in the continental region with supporting partners and developed an initial three-month operational response plan.A transition and recovery plan for a one-year period has been developed. This plan will be implemented under leadership from the Ministry of Health, with support from partners, including WHO.Partners from the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) were mobilized to assist in response activities. Several experts have been deployed through WHO to support case management, laboratory, epidemiology, and surveillance functions.WHO supported the Ministry of Health in providing training for surveillance activities, including case investigation, contact tracing, active case search in health facilities and the community, and in supervising field teams.The UN system, including WHO, continues to advocate for the Prevention of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse as it awaits government agreement to undertake community-based activities.Partner SupportSeveral partners supported the government-led response through the provision of technical, financial and operational support. These include WHO, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US-CDC), the Cuban Medical Brigade, the Africa Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), and the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF).SurveillanceWHO supported the establishment of the alert and dispatch center for MVD alert management.WHO provided training and supportive supervision of surveillance activities, including case investigation and contact tracing and coordinating with healthcare facilities for active surveillance.Laboratory With the support of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and WHO, laboratories with RT-PCR capacities were set up initially in Ebebiyin and then in Bata.MVD diagnostic and sequencing capacities were subsequently implemented in Malabo at the Baney laboratory with support from Institut Pasteur Dakar and WHO, as well as other partners.WHO continues to support laboratory operations as well as specimen transportation notably through the training of shippers of infectious substances.Clinical careWHO supported the MoH in the establishment of the Mondong Treatment Center in Bata and in the coordination of a referral system, including three ambulances that can retrieve suspected and confirmed patients from any district in the region and bring them to the Mondong treatment center.WHO also supported the MoH in the establishment of a survivor clinic that provides medical and psychological care and testing to survivors.Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) and WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene)WHO supported the establishment of the MoH regional IPC task force for coordination of IPC activities which met daily.In collaboration with MOH and US CDC, WHO supported the development and implementation of the National Strategy for the IPC response which was endorsed by MOH and implemented by key partners including UNICEF and Africa CDC.WHO developed IPC technical guidance and other products including Standard Operating Procedures, checklists, training materials and tools as needed.WHO supported the MoH in developing a rapid health care facility evaluation tool on IPC measures in place (such as screening and isolation capacity), including making this tool available online.WHO provided IPC training modules in the context of MVD, which were adopted and used to train health workers in all the affected districts as well as adopted by key implementing partners.WHO operational support and logistics (OSL) and UNICEF identified key IPC supplies required (including personal protective equipment, alcohol-based hand rub, etc).WHO worked with partners to advocate for improved Water, Sanitation and Hygiene in health facilities, in particular water supply and waste management.WHO supported the establishment, training and implementation of decontamination and safe and dignified burial teams.WHO recruited and trained five national IPC focal points in Bata, Ebibeyin, Mongomo, Evinayong and Malabo.Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE) WHO supported MoH in the development of an RCCE national plan and establish an RCCE coordination with key partners (UNICEF, IFRC, Africa CDC, among others) to ensure timely, relevant and actionable RCCE messaging, and activities reach affected and at-risk populations.Intensive and tailored public awareness, strategic networking, and capacity building for RCCE national experts, social mobilizers, and community leaders were implemented in all the affected districts.\u00a0 Religious leaders, decision-makers, school delegates, volunteers, media professionals, etc. were engaged to enhance community involvement in the response.Border health and points of entryOn 26 April 2023, WHO organized a webinar with the support of the US-CDC and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) to raise awareness on the necessary border health readiness and response activities in the context of MVD outbreaks for affected and neighboring countries.Operational support and logistics (OSL)\u200bWHO has provided operational and logistics support and maintenance of the Marburg treatment centre, including structural rehabilitation, provision of electricity and water, and supply chain management.WHO established support for fleet management, including three ambulances on standby 24/7 at the Bata treatment centr\u200be, and approximately 20 vehicles.WHO has provided essential medicines and supplies to all pillars.WHO established a central warehouse for essential items in Bata, which supports distribution to other areas. Readiness and preparedness in neighboring countries  Readiness activities were scaled up in the neighbouring countries of Cameroon and Gabon to detect as early as possible any suspected case. All alerts from these neighbouring countries were investigated to rule out MVD. WHO developed a readiness checklist to assist neighbouring countries in assessing their level of readiness, and identifying potential gaps and concrete actions to be taken in case of any potential outbreak of filovirus including MVD. The checklist consists of several key components and an average score is calculated to provide readiness scores to each of the identified countries. A second round of readiness assessment across all pillars was conducted for Cameroon and Gabon. Based on the gaps identified during the assessments, a gap analysis was conducted and shared with Cameroon and Gabon to inform priority readiness activities. The identified gaps were addressed through the optimization of operational capacities and capabilities using various strategies, including trainings, table-top exercises, and simulation exercises. Additionally, experts were deployed to support the implementation of the readiness activities.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "In compliance with WHO recommendations, the criteria to declare the end of an outbreak after two maximum incubation periods (42 days) was observed with no new confirmed or probable case of MVD detected.Based on knowledge of past outbreaks of filovirus disease, there remains a risk of re-emergence of MVD even following the declaration of the end of the outbreak. Undetected transmission of Marburg virus may exist in the country; not all chains of transmission were definitively linked, and one confirmed case was never identified. The initial source of the outbreak has not been identified, and a new emergence of disease is possible, including from interaction with animal reservoirs. The virus may also persist for an extended period in body fluids of survivors, including semen, underlying the importance of their participation in the survivors program, and the support the program provides.Based on the available information at the end of MVD outbreak in Equatorial Guinea, the risk of MVD remerging is considered as low\u00a0at the national level, low at the subregional level, regional level and at the global level.",
        "WHO Advice": "The current WHO recommendation is that most response activities continue for three months after the outbreak ends, to make sure that if the disease re-emerges, health authorities can detect it right away, prevent the disease from spreading, and ultimately save lives.WHO advises the following risk reduction measures as an effective way to reduce MVD transmission:Reducing the risk of bat-to-human transmission arising from prolonged exposure to mines or caves inhabited by fruit bat colonies. During work or research activities or tourist visits in mines or caves inhabited by fruit bat colonies, people should wear gloves and other appropriate protective clothing (including masks). During outbreaks, all animal products (blood and meat) should be thoroughly cooked before consumption.Health facilities should ensure IPC measure programs are in place including screening for cases of MVD, training of health workers on IPC practices, safe injection practices, environmental cleaning and disinfection protocols are in place, decontamination of reusable medical devices and safe waste management.\u00a0Health workers caring for patients with confirmed or suspected MVD should apply transmission-based precautions in addition to standard precautions, including appropriate use of personal protective equipment and hand hygiene according to the\u00a0WHO 5 moments\u00a0to avoid contact with patients' blood and other body fluids and with contaminated surfaces and objects.Surveillance activities should be strengthened to ensure early detection of any future cases. Raising community awareness of the risk factors for Marburg virus infection and the protective measures individuals can take to reduce human exposure to the virus is key to reducing human infections and deaths. This includes reminders for persons with symptoms to immediately seek care in health facilities to reduce the risk of transmission in the community and to receive treatment, thereby improving chances for recovery. Community and family members should avoid caring for symptomatic individuals at home, avoid touching bodies of people deceased with MVD symptoms, other potentially contaminated items, and surfaces, and encourage them to go to a health facility for assessment and treatment.WHO advises against applying international travel and/or trade measures to Equatorial Guinea.",

        "Location": "United Republic of Tanzania",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "This Disease Outbreak News was first published on 2 June 2023 and updated on 9 June 2023 to include a risk statement.\nOn 2 June 2023, the Ministry of Health of the United Republic of Tanzania declared the end of its first documented outbreak of Marburg virus disease (MVD). Between 21 March and 31 May, a total of nine cases (eight laboratory-confirmed and one probable) were reported. All cases were reported from Bukoba district, Kagera region. A total of six deaths (case fatality ratio 67%) were reported during the outbreak.\nIn accordance with WHO recommendations, the declaration was made 42 days (twice the maximum incubation period for Marburg virus infection) after the last possible exposure to an MVD probable or confirmed case.\nWHO encourages countries to maintain most response activities for three months after the outbreak ends. This is to make sure that if the disease re-emerges, health authorities would be able to detect it immediately, prevent the disease from spreading again, and ultimately save lives.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 21 March 2023, the Ministry of Health (MoH) of the United Republic of Tanzania officially declared the first MVD outbreak in the country. Between 21 March and 31 May, a total of nine cases, including eight laboratory-confirmed cases and one probable (the index case), were reported (Figure 1). The last confirmed case was reported on 11 April 2023 and the date of sample collection of the second negative PCR test was on 19 April 2023. All cases were reported from Bukoba district, Kagera region, in the north of the country.Among the confirmed cases, three have recovered, and a total of six deaths (CFR 67%) have been reported, of which five were confirmed and one was a probable case. Cases ranged in age from 1 to 59 years old (median 35 years old), with males being the most affected (n= 6; 67%). Six cases were close relatives of the index case, and two were healthcare workers who provided medical care to the patients.On 2 June 2023, the MoH of the United Republic of Tanzania declared the end of the MVD outbreak. This declaration was made 42 days (twice the maximum incubation period for Marburg virus infection) after the last possible exposure to MVD probable or confirmed case. Figure 1: Distribution of MVD cases (confirmed and probable) by date of symptom onset in the United Republic of Tanzania, as of 31 May 2023.Figure 2: Map of district reporting MVD confirmed and probable cases in the United Republic of Tanzania, as of 31 May 2023.",
        "Epidemiology": "Marburg virus spreads between people via direct contact through broken skin or mucous membranes with the blood, secretions, organs, or other body fluids of infected people and with surfaces and materials such as bedding, and clothing contaminated with these fluids. Healthcare workers have previously been infected while treating patients with suspected or confirmed MVD. Burial ceremonies involving direct contact with the body of the deceased can also contribute to the transmission of the Marburg virus.The incubation period varies from 2 to 21 days. Illness caused by the Marburg virus begins abruptly, with high fever, severe headache, and severe malaise. Severe haemorrhagic manifestations may appear between five and seven days from symptom onset. However, not all cases have haemorrhagic signs, and fatal cases usually have some form of bleeding, often from multiple areas.\u00a0Early supportive care \u2013 rehydration with oral or intravenous fluids \u2013 and treatment of specific symptoms and co-infections can improve survival. A range of potential treatments are being evaluated, including blood products, immune therapies, and drug therapies.\u00a0\u00a0This was the first documented outbreak of MVD reported in the United Republic of Tanzania. There is an ongoing outbreak of MVD in Equatorial Guinea (for more information, please see the\u00a0Disease outbreak news published on 8 May 2023 in Equatorial Guinea and the United Republic of Tanzania).\u00a0\u00a0Other MVD outbreaks have been previously reported in Ghana (2022), Guinea (2021), Uganda (2017, 2014, 2012, 2007), Angola (2004-2005), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (2000 and 1998), Kenya (1990, 1987, 1980) and South Africa (1975).",
        "Public Health Response": "The MoH, together with WHO and other partners, initiated response measures to control the outbreak and prevent further spread to other regions in the country and neighboring countries. Regular coordination meetings were held to coordinate responses.Active case search and alert management were implemented, with a total of 243 alerts received as of 30 May, of which 62 MVD suspected cases were detected, and samples were sent for laboratory confirmation. The eight laboratory-confirmed cases were identified, and the remaining samples tested negative. A total of 212 contacts were identified and monitored with 210 having completed their 21-day follow-up period with no symptoms. Of the remaining two contacts, one developed symptoms and subsequently tested positive for MVD while the other died due to other causes.The three recovered cases were provided with care and, together with their relatives, received mental health and psychosocial support services (MHPSS) through the survivor programme.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "On 2 June 2023, the Ministry of Health of the United Republic of Tanzania declared the end of the MVD outbreak that affected Bukoba district in Kagera region.\u00a0 This was the first documented MVD outbreak in the country.MVD is an epidemic-prone disease associated with high case fatality ratios (CFR 24-90%). MVD is caused by the same family (Filoviridae) as Ebola virus disease (EVD) and is clinically similar. In the early course of the disease, clinical diagnosis of MVD is difficult to distinguish from other tropical febrile illnesses because of the similarities in the clinical symptoms. Other viral hemorrhagic fevers need to be excluded, particularly Ebola diseases, as well as malaria, typhoid fever, and dengue. Epidemiologic features can help differentiate between diseases (i.e., exposure to bats, caves, or mining).Marburg virus has been isolated from fruit bats (Roussettus aegyptiacus) that are present in the United Republic of Tanzania and countries neighboring the affected Kagera region, therefore the same bat species may carry the virus in this region.Based on the available information at the end of MVD outbreak in the United Republic of Tanzania, the risk is considered as low\u00a0at national level, low at the subregional level, regional level and at the global level.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO encourages countries to maintain most response activities for three months after the outbreak is declared over.

        "Outbreak name": "Outbreak of suspected fungal meningitis associated with surgical procedures performed under spinal anaesthesia",
        "Date Reported": "1 June 2023",
        "Location": "the United States of America and Mexico",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 11 May 2023, the United States of America Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC) notified the Mexico General Directorate of Epidemiology (DGE) of five cases with central nervous system infection (CNSI) in the United States of America. All five cases were females with a history of undergoing surgical procedures performed under spinal anaesthesia in Mexico. The surgeries were performed in two private clinics, located in the city of Matamoros, Tamaulipas state, on the border with the USA.\nLaboratory test results from samples collected from patients in the USA and Mexico were consistent with meningitis caused by pathogenic fungi.\nFungal meningitis is rare but can be fatal and requires immediate medical care.\nWHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation based on the latest available information.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 11 May 2023, the US CDC notified the Mexico\u2019s DGE through the International Health Regulations National Focal Point (IHR NFP),\u00a0 the identification of five female cases with CNSI in the USA, with a history of undergoing surgical procedures performed under spinal anaesthesia in two private clinics in a city in Mexico, bordering the USA. As of 26 May 2023, the health authorities from Mexico and the USA have reported a total of 20 cases presenting with signs and symptoms compatible with CNSI, including two deaths reported by the US CDC. Patients presented to the hospital with symptoms including headache, fever, nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light, and fainting after receiving surgical procedures in two private clinics located in the city of Matamoros, Tamaulipas state in Mexico, on the border with the USA between January and April 2023.The Mexico Epidemiological Diagnosis and Reference Institute (InDRE per its acronym in Spanish) has received five samples of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that tested positive for a fungus, Fusarium solani by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Additionally, according to the health authorities from the USA, the laboratory results from nine suspected cases were consistent with meningitis, of which two CSF and two blood samples showed elevated levels of (1,3)-beta-D-glucan, a biomarker for fungal infection. \u00a0Two pan-fungal PCR tests were negative.According to the investigation performed, a total of 547 people had these procedures\u00a0 between January and April 2023 in the concerned two private clinics, of whom 304 (56%) reside in Mexico, 237 (43%) in the United States, and one in Canada.",
        "Epidemiology": "Several species of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites can cause meningitis, an inflammation of the tissues surrounding the brain and spinal cord. Fungal meningitis can develop after a\u00a0fungal infection spread from somewhere else in the body to the central nervous system. It can be fatal and requires immediate medical care. \u00a0While rare, medical and surgical procedures can lead to fungal meningitis if medical devices or medications are contaminated with fungi, or if proper infection prevention control practices are not taken. This type of healthcare-associated infection can lead to severe illness or death. Healthcare-associated fungal meningitis outbreaks have occurred among patients who received spinal anesthesia.",
        "Public Health Response": "The United States of America and Mexico Health Authorities are investigating additional cases that may be associated with this outbreak in both countries. The response measures include: In the United States of America:On 8 May 2023, through the Emerging Infections Network , US CDC learned of two unusual meningitis cases in Texas with prior spinal anesthesia. On 16 May, the US CDC published a level 2 travel health notice related to fungal infections following procedures performed under spinal anaesthesia in Mexico with recommendations for the public and clinicians.\u00a0Additionally, on 24 May, an interim recommendation for diagnosing and managing cases of suspected fungal meningitis associated with spinal anesthesia administered in Matamoros, Mexico, were also published by the US CDC.On 17 May, the US CDC published a Health Alert Network related to an outbreak of suspected fungal meningitis in patients who underwent procedures performed under spinal anesthesia in Matamoros, Mexico.\u00a0State and local health departments have initiated contacting and follow-up of people through telephone calls and home visits who are known to have had procedures performed under spinal anesthesia at these two clinics since January 2023. Instructions are given to people to go to their nearest health clinic, urgent care, or emergency room for diagnostic testing including a magnetic resonance imaging \u00a0and a lumbar puncture.In Mexico:Epidemiological investigations are ongoing in Matamoros, Mexico. In addition, the DGE is working with State Health Services and the Matamoros Health Jurisdiction on operational definitions. Mexico health authorities are strengthening active epidemiological surveillance for meningitis in Tamaulipas state to achieve timely identification.On 13 May, Tamaulipas Health Authority closed the two private healthcare facilities where these surgical procedures were performed.A follow-up of exposed people was initiated through telephone calls and home visits.On 19 May, the Mexico IHR NFP\u00a0 notified PAHO/WHO of an outbreak of CNSI associated with spinal anaesthesia\u00a0 in Matamoros, Tamaulipas state.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Fungal meningitis cases following a medical/surgical procedure are very infrequent and unusual. In 2012, the US CDC investigated a multistate outbreak of fungal meningitis and other infections among patients who received contaminated preservative-free methylprednisolone acetate\u00a0( MPA) steroid injections; 753 cases were reported, including 64 deaths in 20 States in the USA. The source, vehicle, and the transmission route for the current outbreak remains unknown, although the investigations are ongoing. A fungal infection is suspected based on preliminary information provided by the health authorities from Mexico and the USA.Each year, more than a million people from the USA participate in medical tourism. In 2017, more than 1.4 million Americans sought health care in a variety of countries around the world. These medical tourists commonly travel to Mexico, Canada, and countries in Central America, South America, and the Caribbean. At present, there is no evidence to suggest any secondary spread from these cases of health care associated fungal meningitis The involved healthcare facilities where the procedures were undertaken have been closed since 13 May. However, there is an ongoing investigation and follow up of people who may have been exposed to fungal infections. This may lead to additional cases being reported until the follow up of people exposed to such procedure is completed. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and review the risk assessment based on the latest available information.",
        "WHO Advice": "As \u00a0the outbreak's source is yet to be established, WHO Member States must stay vigilant. It is critically important for affected Member States to identify any possible cases, establish the causal chain, and determine if any substandard/falsified products or procedures could be related. Investigation of these cases will assist in rapid containment at the disease source to prevent additional suspected cases.WHO recommends the continuation of laboratory analyses, case identification and clinical care, follow-up of potentially exposed people, outbreak investigation to identify the agent, the source, the vehicle, and the transmission route, implementation of measures to prevent further infections, and enhancement of Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) measures.IPC measures in health facilities should be reinforced to prevent healthcare-associated transmission. Attention should be paid to ensure injection safety practices are adhered to, including standards being met for medical device disposal or reprocessing (if reusable). Processes used for the storage, transport, and preparation of sharps, syringes, and vials should be examined to ensure sterility prior to use in local healthcare facilities. Use of multidose vials should be avoided. IPC practices should be reviewed and reinforced in operating theaters to ensure they are adhered to, including appropriate personal protective equipment use, before aseptic procedures, including skin antisepsis for safe administration of spinal anesthesia, as well as ensuring environmental cleaning. WHO does not recommend any specific different measures for travellers visiting Mexico. In case of symptoms suggestive of meningitis during or after travel, travelers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history with their healthcare provider.WHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions on Mexico and the United States of America based on the current information available on this event.",

        "Location": "France",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 12 September 2023, local public health authorities in France identified a cluster of 10 cases with suspected botulism, including one death. As of 14 September 2023, the National IHR Focal Point for France has notified WHO of a total of 15 cases of suspected botulism, including one death, reported in Bordeaux and Ile-de-France.\nThe epidemiological investigations indicated that the source of infection is the consumption of homemade preserved sardines , on different dates, at the same restaurant in Bordeaux during the week of 4\u201310 September 2023. The food item was made at the restaurant for consumption on premises.\nDue to the incubation period of up to eight days and the restaurant attracting international visitors during the Rugby World Cup, there is a possibility that additional cases among international visitors may be reported in France, or possibly outside France as travellers returned home, until 18 September.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 12 September 2023, local public health authorities in France identified a cluster of 10 cases with suspected botulism, including one death. As of 14 September 2023, the National IHR Focal Point for France has notified a total of 15 cases of suspected botulism, including one death, reported in Bordeaux and Ile-de-France. Of these 15 cases, 10 have been hospitalised, with eight patients being admitted to an Intensive Care Unit. Fourteen out of the 15 cases are reported among foreign citizens identified from six countries in addition to France. These include Canada, Germany, Greece, Ireland, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the United States of America. All suspected cases consumed the same product (sardines in jars) on different dates at the same restaurant in Bordeaux during the week of 4\u201310 September 2023. The epidemiological investigations indicated that the source of infection is the consumption of homemade preserved sardines. The food item was produced and served at the restaurant.",
        "Epidemiology": "Botulism is a serious neurological condition\u00a0caused by a very potent toxin produced by the bacterium\u00a0\u00a0Clostridium botulinum\u00a0.\u00a0It develops particularly in poorly preserved foods. Human botulism may refer to foodborne botulism, infant botulism, wound botulism, and inhalation botulism or other types of intoxication.Foodborne botulism is a serious, potentially fatal disease. It is an intoxication caused by ingestion of potent neurotoxins\u2014the botulinum toxins\u2014formed in contaminated foods. Person-to-person transmission of botulism does not occur. The manifestations, or symptoms, of intoxication can vary, and \u00a0is characterized by descending, flaccid paralysis that can cause respiratory failure. Early symptoms include marked fatigue, weakness and vertigo, usually followed by blurred vision, dry mouth and difficulty in swallowing and speaking. Vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation and abdominal swelling may also occur. The disease can progress to weakness in the neck and arms, after which the respiratory muscles and muscles of the lower body are affected. There is no fever and no loss of consciousness. Symptoms usually appear from several hours up to 8 days following consumption of contaminated food.Although botulism outbreaks are relatively rare, they are considered public health emergencies that require rapid recognition to identify the disease source, distinguish outbreak types (between natural, accidental or deliberate), prevent additional cases and effectively administer treatment to affected patients. Successful treatment depends significantly on early diagnosis and the rapid administration of the botulinum antitoxin and intensive respiratory care.Incidence of botulism is low, but the mortality rate is high if prompt diagnosis and appropriate, immediate treatment is not given. The disease can be fatal in 5% to 10% of cases.",
        "Public Health Response": "On 11 September, food and serum samples were shipped to the French National Reference Center for Anaerobic Bacteria and Botulism, Institute Pasteur, Paris , and botulinum toxin was confirmed in serum samples and in a food sample (sardines) on 14 September 2023.\u00a0\u00a0The local health authorities inspected the restaurant and all products prepared by the restaurant have been recalled. On 13 September, the local health authorities held a press conference and informed the local healthcare professionals.The national health authorities have issued risk communication advice to sensitize the health care workers about the symptomatology and treatment.Information on cases reported among citizens from foreign countries have been shared with the relevant health authorities in those countries.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Local investigations have identified an estimated 25 persons through credit card receipts who have been exposed (i.e., who likely consumed the suspect food item). The exposure occurred at local level and measures have been implemented to eliminate the source of infection including the removal of the suspected food item, which was not distributed outside the venue. However, given the ranging incubation period of botulism\u2014up to eight days\u2014and that not all customers of the restaurant in Bordeaux may have been identified despite efforts, further cases linked to this event may still occur. This outbreak has occurred at the same time as the Rugby World Cup held from the week of 4 September 2023 attracting followers and rugby teams from all over the world.\u00a0Due to the incubation period up to eight days and the restaurant attracting international visitors, there is a possibility that additional cases among international visitors may be reported either from France or outside of France until 18 September.",
        "WHO Advice": "Prevention of foodborne botulism is based on good practice in food preparation particularly during heating/sterilization and hygiene. Foodborne botulism may be prevented by the inactivation of the bacterium and its spores in heat-sterilized (for example, retorted) or canned products, or by inhibiting bacterial growth and toxin production in other products. The vegetative forms of bacteria can be destroyed by boiling, but the spores can remain viable after boiling even for several hours. However, the spores can be killed by very high temperature treatments such as (commercial) canning.Commercial heat pasteurization (including vacuum packed pasteurized products and hot smoked products) may not be sufficient to kill all spores and therefore the safety of these products must be based on preventing bacterial growth and toxin production. Refrigeration temperatures combined with salt content and/or acidic conditions will prevent the growth of the bacteria and formation of toxin.The neurotoxins themselves are heat-labile and will be destroyed within minutes at temperatures above 80\u00b0C; consequently, only foods improperly processed in which the bacteria or the spores survive, pose a risk.The WHO five keys to safer food serve as the basis for educational programmes to train food handlers and educate the consumers. They are especially important in preventing food poisoning.The five keys are:keep cleanseparate raw and cookedcook thoroughlykeep food at safe temperaturesuse safe water and raw materials.",

        "Outbreak name": "Legionellosis",
        "Date Reported": "14 September 2023",
        "Location": "Poland",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "As of 11 September 2023, a total of 166 cases of legionellosis, including 23 deaths, have been reported from Poland. Legionellosis, more commonly known as Legionnaires' disease, is a pneumonia-like illness, caused by a bacterium, that varies in severity from mild to a severe illness and sometimes fatal form of pneumonia.\nThis observed increase in confirmed cases, and associated hospitalizations and deaths seen since mid-August, is unusual, considering that the number of cases is higher than the annual number reported in Poland since 2016.\nPolish health authorities are coordinating cluster investigation activities, active case finding to identify additional cases, and public health activities to prevent transmission and limit the emergence of new cases, through preventive control measures. Since 7 September, no new cases have been reported, although the infection source has not yet been identified. Investigations are still ongoing to find the source of the outbreak.\nMost people develop Legionnaires' disease by inhaling the bacteria from water or soil. To date there has been no reported direct human-to-human transmission.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 18 August 2023, public health authorities in Rzesz\u00f3w, Poland, announced the detection of a cluster of 158 suspected community-acquired pneumonia cases, including 15 laboratory-confirmed cases of legionellosis among patients admitted to several hospitals in Rzesz\u00f3w.Between 18 August and 11 September 2023, a total of 166 laboratory-confirmed cases, all hospitalized, and 23 associated deaths (CFR of 14%) have been reported. Most cases, 67% (n=112), were recorded in the city of Rzesz\u00f3w, 23% (n=38) of cases in Rzesz\u00f3w county, and 10% (n=16) cases in other locations. Figure 1: Geographic distribution of confirmed Legionellosis cases in Poland between 18 August and 11 September 2023.Preliminary results from an ongoing epidemiological investigation indicate that the first cases developed symptoms on 30 July, while most cases developed symptoms between 12-16 August. Adults between 60 and 90 years are the most affected age group. The most recently reported case has an onset date of 29 August. All 23 related deaths had underlying comorbidities and were between the ages of 53 and 98 (11 females and 12 males).Figure 2: Number of confirmed Legionellosis cases reported in Rzeszow by Epidemic weekLaboratory resultsOnly hospitalized cases are tested for\u00a0Legionella spp. The majority of the cases were confirmed through urine antigen tests and 11 cases were confirmed through respiratory samples by PCR. Culture and sequencing were not possible as the cases were treated with antibiotics.Between 18 August to 11 September 2023, a total of 379 facility inspections were carried out. A total of 222 samples of hot and cold water were taken and investigations are ongoing.",
        "Epidemiology": "Legionellosis is an infection caused by Legionella bacteria. The\u00a0Legionella\u00a0bacteria can cause a mild illness, Pontiac fever, non-pneumonic form of the disease, and Legionnaires\u2019 disease, a severe pneumonia form of illness that can be fatal. Most people catch Legionnaires' disease by inhaling the bacteria from water or soil.Legionnaires\u2019 disease, the pneumonic form, has an incubation period of 2 to 10 days (but up to 16 days have been recorded in some outbreaks). It is an important cause of community- and hospital-acquired pneumonia, and although uncommon, Legionnaires\u2019 disease may cause outbreaks of public health significance. Initially, symptoms are fever, mild cough, loss of appetite, headache, malaise and lethargy, with some patients also experiencing muscle pain, diarrhoea and confusion. The severity of Legionnaires\u2019 disease ranges from a mild cough to rapidly fatal pneumonia. Untreated Legionnaires\u2019 disease usually worsens during the first week.Mortality from Legionnaires\u2019 disease depends on the severity of the disease, the use of antibiotic treatment, the setting where Legionella was acquired, and whether the patient has underlying conditions, including immunosuppression. The death rate may be as high as 40\u201380% in untreated immunosuppressed patients and can be reduced to 5\u201330% through appropriate case management, depending on the severity of the clinical signs and symptoms. Overall, the death rate is usually between 5\u201310%.",
        "Public Health Response": "Meetings of the crisis staff at the Mayor of Rzesz\u00f3w are held daily.Water samples were collected from the water supply system, residences of the sick, healthcare facilities, cooling towers, and installations in buildings\u00a0located in Rzesz\u00f3w, the Rzesz\u00f3w poviat, and the Ropczyce and S\u0119dzisz\u00f3w poviat.An epidemiological investigation, including interviews with patients or relatives, is underway to determine the source of infection.Mapping all positive cases, water sampling sites, and cooling towers is underway.Public fountains, public water sprays, and other public water sources have been shut down temporarily.Rzesz\u00f3w Municipal Water and Sewage Company carried out the routine disinfection of the water supply in the city of Rzesz\u00f3w and adjacent towns on 27\u00a0August 2023.Health care units and long-term care facilities have been instructed to carry out additional inspections of their water systems.Public health advice has been developed and shared across multiple channels.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Legionellosis varies in severity from a mild febrile illness to a severe and sometimes fatal form of pneumonia and is caused by exposure to\u00a0Legionella\u00a0species found in contaminated water and potting mixes. Outbreaks of Legionella have been linked to poorly maintained water systems, particularly cooling towers or evaporative condensers associated with air conditioning and industrial cooling, hot and cold-water systems in public and private buildings, and whirlpool spas.Infection can also occur by aspiration of contaminated water or ice, particularly in susceptible hospital patients. To date, there is no reported human-to-human transmission. Legionnaires' disease requires treatment with antibiotics, and currently, no vaccine is available for Legionnaires' disease.Sporadic outbreaks of Legionnaires' disease have been reported previously in Poland. Between 2017 and 2021, Poland reported between 38 to 74 cases of Legionnaires\u2019 disease annually to the European Surveillance System (TESSy). In 2022, this increased to 111 reported cases.Robust surveillance and response activities are being implemented during the current outbreak, and case numbers have been reduced. Nonetheless, without an identified source of\u00a0Legionella\u00a0bacteria, there is a continued risk of developing Legionellosis for people working or living in the affected areas. Older adults, smokers, and people with weakened immune systems are particularly susceptible to the disease.Travel-associated Legionnaires\u2019 disease (TALD) is a frequent phenomenon, with, on average, about 20% of the cases of legionellosis detected in Europe considered to be travel-associated. The outbreak is reported in the south-eastern city of Rzesz\u00f3w, the main hub for humanitarian aid for Ukraine and the transit hub for international military support for Ukraine; therefore, TALD may be expected in people visiting Rzesz\u00f3w.According to the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), in 2021, the EU/EEA witnessed the highest annual notification rate of Legionnaires\u2019 disease, with 2.4 cases per 100 000 population. The cause of the increased reported incidence observed during that period in Europe remains unclear. Legionnaires\u2019 disease is a notifiable disease in the EU, and the events are closely followed up through ECDC and European Legionnaires\u2019 Disease Surveillance Network (ELDSNet).",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO recommends the continuation of laboratory analyses, case identification and clinical care, contact tracing, outbreak investigation to identify the source(s), implementation of measures to prevent further infections, and enhancement of Infection, Prevention and Control (IPC) measures. IPC measures in health facilities have been enhanced during the COVID-19 pandemic and should be reinforced to prevent healthcare-associated transmission, including measures to control waterborne pathogens.\u00a0 WHO does not recommend any specific different measures for travellers. In case of symptoms suggestive of respiratory illness during or after travel, travellers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history with their healthcare provider. Countries with Legionella cases reported after travel to Poland should notify their regional IHR focal points.WHO advises against applying any travel or trade restrictions on Poland based on the current information available on this event.",

        "Location": "Nigeria",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "Since epidemiological week 26, ending 2 July 2023, Nigeria has recorded an unusual increase in cases of diphtheria across several states. From 30 June to 31 August 2023, a total of 5898 suspected cases were reported from 59 Local Government Areas (LGAs) in 11 states. In week 34 (ending 27 August 2023), 234 suspected cases have been reported from 20 LGAs in five states, with one Lab confirmed case1 from the 22 samples collected. Eighteen of these cases were epidemiologically linked 2 and 141 were classified as clinically compatible.\nDiphtheria is a highly contagious vaccine-preventable disease caused mainly by the bacteria Corynebacterium diphtheriae which can be fatal in 5-10% of cases, with a higher mortality rate in young children.\nWHOs most recent risk assessment of the diphtheria outbreak in Nigeria has maintained the risk as high at the national level, and low at the regional and global levels. Public health measures such as vaccination response, enhanced surveillance for early case detection, case management and risk communication coordinated by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), in collaboration with WHO and other partners, are being implemented in response to the outbreak.",
        "Description of the Situation": "Since the last Disease Outbreak News\u00a0on diphtheria in Nigeria was published on 27 April 2023, the country has reported suspected cases of diphtheria weekly to WHO. However, between 30 June and 31 August 2023, Nigeria recorded an unusual increase in the number of confirmed diphtheria cases4 (figure 1). From 30 June to 31 August 2023, a total of 5898 suspected cases were reported from 59 LGAs in 11 states across the country. The majority (99.4%) of suspected cases were reported from Kano (1816), Katsina (234), Yobe (158), Bauchi (79), Kaduna (45) and Borno (33).\u00a0 Of the cumulative 8353 suspected cases reported since the outbreak was first reported in 2022, 4717 (56.5%) cases were confirmed4 (lab confirmed1 (169; 3.6%), epidemiologically linked2 (117; 2.5%) and clinical compatibility3 (4431; 93.9%)). While 1857 (22.2%) were discarded as not compatible with diphtheria, 1048 (12.5%) cases are pending classification and 731 (8.8%) cases had unknown diagnosis. The case fatality ratio dropped slightly from 6.7% during the last update to 6.1%. Of the 4717 confirmed cases, 3466 (73.5%) were aged 1 \u2013 14 years, of these 699 were aged 0-4 years, 1505 aged 5-9 years, 1262 (aged 10 \u2013 14 years. More than half of the cases (2656; 56.3%) were females. Only 1074 (22.8%) of the confirmed cases were fully vaccinated against diphtheria, 299 (6.3%) were partially vaccinated. More than half of the cases (2801; 59.4%) were unvaccinated. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Figure 1: Diphtheria cases by year/epi-week in Nigeria, 1 May 2022 \u2013 27 August 2023Definitive diagnosis through laboratory molecular testing identified Corynebacterium diphtheriae and Corynebacterium ulcerans isolates as the species driving this outbreak, particularly C. diphtheria as the major etiologic pathogen associated with the current outbreak. Antibiotic susceptibility tests for 62 isolates of C. diphtheriae have been carried out and the findings revealed that all isolates were resistant to penicillin, and most were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfathiazole and ciprofloxacin, while being susceptible to erythromycin. Thus, erythromycin became the drug of choice in the management of this outbreak (Figure 2). Figure 2 Drug sensitivity results of toxigenic Corynebacterium diphtheriae isolated in Nigeria, May 2022 \u2013 July 2023Source: Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and Prevention",
        "Epidemiology": "Diphtheria is a highly contagious vaccine-preventable disease caused mainly by\u00a0Corynebacterium diphtheria\u00a0but also by\u00a0Corynebacterium ulcerans.\u00a0It spreads between people mainly by direct contact or through the air via respiratory droplets. The disease can affect all age groups; however, unimmunized children are most at risk.Symptoms often come on gradually, beginning with a sore throat and fever. In severe cases, the bacteria produce a poison (toxin) that causes a thick grey or white patch at the back of throat. This can block the airways, making it hard to breathe or swallow, and also creates a barking cough. The neck may swell in part due to enlarged lymph nodes.Treatment involves administering diphtheria antitoxin (DAT) as well as antibiotics. Vaccination against diphtheria has been effective in reducing the mortality and morbidity from diphtheria dramatically. Diphtheria is fatal in 5-10% of cases, with a higher mortality rate in young children. However, in settings with poor access to diphtheria antitoxin, the CFR can be as high as 40%.Nigeria has recorded diphtheria outbreaks in the past, notably in 2011 and 2022. In 2023, a previous outbreak of diphtheria was recorded between January and April 2023 affecting 21 of the 36 states and the FCT. Details of the outbreak have been published on\u00a0Disease Outbreak News.",
        "Public Health Response": "Coordination: WHO Country Office Incident Management System revised, National Emergency Operation Centre (EOC) activated likewise state EOC in the diphtheria high burden Kaduna, Katsina, Borno; partners mapping ongoing.

Staff health security and wellbeing: general security briefings, reporting template, FAQ on diphtheria",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Diphtheria is a vaccine-preventable disease caused mainly by exotoxin-producing Corynebacterium diphtheriae but also by Corynebacterium ulcerans.\u00a0 Diphtheria is fatal in 5 - 10% of cases, with a higher mortality rate in young children. Treatment involves administering DAT as well as antibiotics. Vaccination against diphtheria reduces the mortality and morbidity of diphtheria dramatically.Nigeria is currently facing a second wave of a diphtheria outbreak after a first wave of the outbreak was recorded between epidemiological week 52, 2022 (1 January 2023) and week 20, 2023 (22 May 2023). There is an increase in the affected population with a rise in the number of confirmed cases and related deaths reported in epidemiological weeks 31-33. There is an increased risk of transmission, with clusters and outbreaks reported in newly affected LGAs, with currently 27 LGAs reporting one clinically compatible case in the last three reporting weeks relative to 15 LGAs that had active case in the preceding three weeks.The low national coverage (57%) of the Pentavalent vaccine (Penta 3) administered in routine immunization, and the suboptimal vaccination coverage in the pediatric population\u2014with 43% of the target population unvaccinated\u2014underscores the risk of further spread and the accumulation of a critical mass of susceptible population in the country with sub-optimal herd or population immunity. Vaccine coverage of 80\u201385% must be maintained to ensure community protection.This emphasizes the urgent need to strengthen diphtheria vaccination coverage nationwide, especially in the most affected states, such as Kano. Additionally, particular attention is necessary for regions experiencing insecurity challenges, like the Northwest, as it hampers vaccine accessibility. Due to insecurity, especially in Northeast Nigeria, vaccination coverage remains suboptimal.DAT supply is currently very constrained and insufficient to respond to current demands, as there is only a limited number of manufacturers and large outbreaks are being reported in different regions of the world. \u00a0The NCDC, with support from WHO and other partners have procured 10 050 DAT vials for case management in response to the outbreak.Diphtheria outbreaks are underreported in Nigeria. According to the 2021 Nigeria Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey and National Immunization Coverage Survey, the third dose of pentavalent vaccine (Penta3) coverage was 57% in 2021.WHO second Rapid Risk Assessment for diphtheria in Nigeria reassessed and maintained the risk as high at the national level and low at the regional and global levels.",
        "WHO Advice": "The control of diphtheria is based on primary prevention of disease by ensuring high population immunity through vaccination, and secondary prevention of spread by the rapid investigation of close contacts to ensure prompt treatment of those infected.Epidemiological surveillance ensuring early detection of diphtheria outbreaks should be in place in all countries, and all countries should have access to laboratory facilities for reliable identification of toxigenic C. diphtheriae. Adequate quantities of diphtheria antitoxin should be available nationally or regionally for the medical management of cases.Vaccination is key to preventing cases and outbreaks, and adequate clinical management involves administering diphtheria anti-toxin to neutralize the toxin and antibiotics reducing complications and mortality.WHO recommends early reporting and case management of suspected diphtheria cases to initiate the timely treatment of cases, and follow-up of contacts, and ensuring a supply of diphtheria antitoxin.WHO advises implementing the following Infection Prevention & Control measures in health care settings:1) Apply standard precautions, with focus on hand hygiene, personal protective equipment and equipment and environmental cleaning and disinfection droplet and contact precautions (at all times).2) At screening/triage, immediately place patients with symptoms of Upper Respiratory Tract Infection in a separate area until examined, and, if a suspected case, cohorted with patients with the same diagnosis. Keep the isolation area segregated from other patient-care areas.3) Maintain one meter between patients. Keep patient care areas well ventilated.4) Avoid patient movement or transport out of isolation area. If movement is necessary out of isolation area, have patient use a medical mask and cover any wounds/lesions on patient\u2019s body.The case management should be carried out following the WHO guidelines. In addition, high-risk populations such as young children under five years of age, school children, the elderly, close contact with diphtheria cases, and healthcare workers should be vaccinated on a priority basis. A coordinated response and community engagement can support further transmission and control of the ongoing outbreak. Prophylactic antibiotics (penicillin or erythromycin, dependent on drug sensitivity) are indicated for close contacts of confirmed cases for seven days. If the culture is positive for toxigenic Corynebacterium spp., then the contact should be treated as a case with an antibiotic course for two weeks (DAT is not needed for asymptomatic cases or cases without a pseudomembrane).Although travelers do not have a special risk of diphtheria infection, it is recommended that national authorities remind travelers going to areas with diphtheria outbreaks to be appropriately vaccinated in accordance with the national vaccination scheme established in each country prior to travel. A booster dose is recommended if more than five years have passed since their last dose.",

        "Outbreak name": "Influenza A (H1N1) variant virus",
        "Date Reported": "13 September 2023",
        "Location": "the Netherlands",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 2 September 2023, the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport of the Netherlands notified the World Health Organization (WHO) of a laboratory-confirmed human case of infection with a swine-origin influenza A(H1N1) variant (v) virus in the province of North Brabant, Netherlands. This is the first human infection caused by influenza A(H1N1)v virus reported in the Netherlands in 2023.\nWorldwide sporadic human cases of influenza A(H1N1)v have been reported previously, including from the Netherlands. According to the International Health Regulations (IHR,2005), a human infection caused by a novel influenza A virus subtype is an event that has the potential for high public health impact and must be notified to the WHO.\nThis case was picked up as part of routine surveillance of respiratory illnesses. Based on the available information, there is no clear indication of the source of infection, and no direct contact with pigs was reported. As of 7 September, there were no symptomatic contacts of this case and no further detections have been reported in routine surveillance. All five close contacts were followed for 10 days- the maximum incubation period and none developed symptoms. Thus, there was no evidence of person-to-person transmission and the case is considered as a sporadic human case of influenza A(H1N1)v. The likelihood of community-level spread among humans and/or international disease spread through humans is considered as low.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 2 September 2023, WHO was notified of a confirmed human infection with a swine influenza A(H1N1)v virus, in Netherlands through the European Commission's confidential Early Warning and Response System (EWRS).The case is an adult from the province of North Brabant with no underlying medical conditions and no history of occupational exposure to animals. On 20 August 2023, the patient developed fatigue and general malaise and the following day developed an acute respiratory infection with onset of chills, sneeze, cough, headache, and generalized weakness, followed by fever on 22 August. On 21 August 2023, the patient reported symptoms as part of participatory surveillance[1] of acute respiratory infections and submitted a self-collected combined nose and throat swab specimen to the laboratory. On 22 August 2023, the specimen was forwarded at the Dutch National Influenza Centre location at the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) where it tested positive for influenza A virus and negative for A(H1N1)pdm09, both tests included on a commercial 24 pathogen multiplex nucleic acid amplification assay on 23 August. Further routine subtyping was performed on 24 and 25 August with RT-qPCR assays. Tests for seasonal influenza viruses and H5 viruses were negative. In addition, a laboratory-developed test (LDT) and another commercial assay for generic influenza A virus detection confirmed the presence of type A influenza virus in the specimen.Routine whole genome sequencing using nanopore technique and virus isolation were started on 28 August. On 30 August, sequencing results revealed that the virus, A/Netherlands/10534/2023, is an A(H1N1)v Eurasian avian-like clade 1C.2.2 swine influenza virus. The HA genome segment clustered closely with recent clade 1C.2.2 swine influenza viruses from 2022 and 2023 from the Netherlands.[2] It clustered less closely with previous clade 1C.2.2 A(H1N1)v (from 2019) and A(H1N2)v (from 2020) viruses from the Netherlands. Phenotypically, the virus is sensitive to neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir.The virus isolate will be shared with the WHO Collaborating Centre in London, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH) avian and swine influenza reference laboratory at the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA), UK. The sequences are available from the GISAID database under accession EPI_ISL_18168180.As of 13 September, the person is recovered. Investigations reported that the individual did not work at a pig farm or other business involving pigs and does not work in health care. Therefore, there is no clear indication of the source of infection.",
        "Epidemiology": "Influenza A(H1) viruses are enzootic in swine populations in most regions of the world. When an influenza virus that normally circulates in swine is detected in a person, it is called a \u201cvariant influenza virus\u201d. H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2 are major subtypes of swine influenza A viruses in pigs and occasionally infect humans, usually after direct or indirect exposure to pigs or contaminated environments.Human infections with variant viruses tend to result in mild clinical illness, although some cases have been hospitalized with more severe disease and some have been fatal.Sporadic human infections caused by influenza A(H1N1)v and A(H1N2)v viruses have been reported in the Netherlands previously, and there has been no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission.This is the first human infection caused by swine influenza A(H1N1)v virus reported in 2023 in the Netherlands, and the third human infection over the past five years. Since 1986, nine variant cases have been documented in humans in the Netherlands.",
        "Public Health Response": "National authorities monitored the case and all close contacts. As of 7 September, none of the five close contacts have reported any symptoms. Further antigenic virus characterization is ongoing. The Zoonosis Centre and veterinarians conducted an investigation, but no possible source of infection was identified. \u00a0Therefore, no animal monitoring or testing was performed.Few influenza viruses are currently detected in the Netherlands, and none of these characterized are variant swine influenza A viruses, apart from the current case reported.The (online) participatory surveillance; part of\u00a0www.influenzanet.info is focused on syndromic surveillance among those who may not seek care for their illness and includes a self-test study with over 17 000 participants. Participants are asked each week whether they have symptoms. From those who report a sore throat, runny nose, cough, or dyspnoea up to 200 persons are invited each week to send in a combined nose and throat swab for centralized testing at the RIVM. Over 5500 specimens have been tested since October 2022.[3]",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Most human cases result from exposure to swine influenza viruses through contact with infected swine or contaminated environments. Occasionally, the source of exposure has remained unidentified. As these viruses continue to be detected in swine populations worldwide, further human cases following direct or indirect contact with infected swine can be expected.Current evidence suggests that these viruses have not acquired the ability to sustain transmission among humans. There has been limited, non-sustained human-to-human transmission of variant influenza viruses, although ongoing community transmission has not been identified. In this event, there was no human-to-human transmission resulting in symptomatic disease detected and no further detections have been reported in routine surveillance.The risk of detecting additional cases associated with this event appears to be low.If needed, the risk assessment will be reviewed should further epidemiological or virological information become available.",
        "WHO Advice": "Surveillance:This case does not change the current WHO recommendations on public health measures and seasonal influenza surveillance.WHO does not advise special traveller screening at points of entry or restrictions concerning the current situation of influenza viruses at the human-animal interface.\u00a0Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect virological, epidemiological and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health and timely virus sharing for risk assessment.Notification and investigation:\u00a0All human infections caused by a novel influenza subtype are notifiable under the IHR and State Parties to the IHR (2005) are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic. Evidence of illness is not required.In the case of a confirmed or suspected human infection caused by a novel influenza virus with pandemic potential, including a variant virus, a thorough epidemiologic investigation of a history of exposure to animals, travel, and contact tracing should be conducted. The epidemiologic investigation should include early identification of unusual respiratory events that could signal person-to-person transmission of the novel virus. Clinical samples collected from the time and place of the case should be tested and sent to a WHO Collaboration Center for further characterization.\u00a0Travel and trade:WHO does not recommend any travel and/or trade restrictions for the Netherlands based on the currently available information.\u00a0\u00a0Prevention measures:\u00a0\u00a0General hygiene measures, such as washing hands before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered. Travelers to countries with known outbreaks of animal influenza should avoid farms, contact with animals in live animal markets, entering areas where animals may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with animal faeces. Influenza viruses that infect pigs are different from human influenza viruses. There is no vaccine for influenza A(H1N1)v infection licensed for use in humans. However, some partners develop candidate vaccine viruses (CVV) for novel zoonotic influenza viruses with pandemic potential as part of pandemic preparedness activities.Generally, influenza vaccines against human influenza viruses are not expected to protect people from influenza viruses that normally circulate in pigs. Although the seasonal influenza vaccine does not protect against swine viruses, WHO recommends seasonal influenza vaccination to avoid severe disease from infection with the seasonal influenza virus.",

        "Location": "Saudi Arabia",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "From 13 September 2022 to 12 August 2023, three laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), including two deaths, were reported to WHO by the Ministry of Health of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Close contacts for the three cases were followed up by the Ministry of Health, and no secondary cases were identified. The notification of these cases reiterates the need for global awareness of MERS-CoV as the disease continues to pose a threat in countries where MERS-CoV is circulating in dromedary camels, including those in the Middle East.",
        "Description of the Situation": "Between 13 September 2022 to 12 August 2023, the Ministry of Health of KSA reported three additional cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), with two associated deaths. The cases were reported from Riyadh, Asser, and Makkah Al Mukarramah regions (Figure 1).\u00a0Laboratory confirmation of the cases was performed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).All three cases were non-health-care workers, who presented with fever, cough, and shortness of breath, and had comorbidities. Of the three cases, two had a history of contact with dromedary camels and all three cases had a history of consumption of raw camel milk in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. All three cases were male, and aged 42, 83, and 85 years respectively (Table 1).Since the first report of MERS-CoV in KSA in 2012, human infections have been reported from 27 countries, in all six WHO regions. Of the reported 2605 cases, the majority of MERS-CoV cases (2196; 84%) have been reported from KSA, including these newly reported cases. Of the 937 deaths reported from 27 countries, a total of 856 (91%) deaths have been reported from KSA, including the newly reported deaths (Figure 2).Figure 1.\u00a0Geographical distribution of MERS-CoV cases between 13 September 2022 and 12 August by city and region, KSA (n=3).Table 1.\u00a0MERS-CoV cases reported by KSA between 13 September 2022 and 12 August 2023Figure 2:\u00a0 Epidemic curve of MERS-CoV cases and deaths reported in KSA between 2012 and 12 August 2023",
        "Epidemiology": "Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory infection caused by the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Approximately 36% of patients with MERS have died, though this may be an overestimate of the true mortality rate, as mild cases of MERS-CoV may be missed by existing surveillance systems, and the case fatality ratio (CFR) is calculated based only on laboratory-confirmed cases.Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedary camels, which are the natural host and zoonotic source of the virus. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts and in healthcare settings and outside of the healthcare setting, there has been limited human-to-human transmission.MERS-CoV infections range from showing no symptoms (asymptomatic) or mild respiratory symptoms, to severe acute respiratory disease and death. A typical presentation of MERS disease is fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Pneumonia is a common finding, but not always present. Gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhoea, have also been reported. Severe illness can cause respiratory failure that requires mechanical ventilation and support in an intensive care unit. The virus appears to cause more severe disease in older people, persons with weakened immune systems, and those with comorbidities or chronic diseases such as renal disease, cancer, chronic lung disease, and diabetes.No vaccine or specific treatment is currently available, although several MERS-CoV-specific vaccines and therapeutics are in development. Treatment is supportive and based on the patient\u2019s clinical condition and symptoms.",
        "Public Health Response": "Follow-up of the close contacts was conducted for all three cases, and no secondary cases were identified.For the two cases reporting contact with camels, the Ministry of Agriculture was informed, and an investigation of camels was conducted. There are no treatments available for MERS-CoV in animals. The identified positive camels were isolated until RT-PCR testing was negative.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "From 13 September 2012 to 12 August 2023, the total number of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection cases reported globally to WHO was 2605, with 937 (CFR 36%) associated deaths. The majority of these cases occurred in countries in the Arabian Peninsula, including\u00a02196 cases with 856 related deaths (CFR 39%) in KSA. There has been one large outbreak outside of the Middle East, in the Republic of Korea, in May 2015, during which 186 laboratory-confirmed cases (185 in the Republic of Korea and 1 in China) and 38 deaths were reported. The index case in that outbreak had a travel history to the Middle East. The global number reflects the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases reported to WHO under IHR (2005) or directly by Ministries of Health. The total number of deaths includes the deaths that WHO is aware of to date through follow-up with affected Member States.\u00a0WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East and/or other countries where MERS-CoV is circulating in dromedaries, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who were exposed to the virus through contact with\u00a0dromedaries\u00a0or their products (for example, consumption of raw camel milk), or in a healthcare setting. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.\u00a0\u00a0The number of MERS cases reported to WHO has substantially declined since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. This is likely the result of epidemiological surveillance activities for COVID-19 being prioritized and the similar clinical picture of both diseases, resulting in reduced testing and detection of MERS CoV cases. The Ministry of Health of KSA is working to improve testing capacities for better detection of MERS-CoV during the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0In addition, measures taken during the COVID-19 pandemic to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission (e.g., mask wearing, hand hygiene, physical distancing, improving ventilation of indoor spaces, respiratory etiquette, stay-at-home orders, reduced mobility) also likely reduced opportunities for onward human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV.",
        "WHO Advice": "Based on the current situation and available information, WHO re-emphasizes the importance of strong surveillance by all Member States for acute respiratory infections, including MERS-CoV, and to carefully review and investigate any unusual patterns.\u00a0Human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV in healthcare settings has been associated with delays in recognizing the early symptoms of MERS-CoV infection, slow triage of suspected cases, and delays in implementing infection, prevention, and control (IPC) measures. IPC measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV between people in healthcare facilities. Healthcare workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, at every interaction in healthcare settings. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures or in settings where aerosol generating procedures are conducted. Early identification, case management and isolation of cases, quarantine of contacts, together with appropriate infection prevention and control measures in health care setting and public health awareness can prevent human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV.\u00a0 MERS-CoV appears to cause more severe disease in people with underlying chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons. Therefore, people with these underlying medical conditions should avoid close contact with animals, particularly dromedaries, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus may be circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.\u00a0 Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk, camel urine or eating meat that has not been thoroughly cooked.\u00a0 The consumption of raw or undercooked animal products, including milk and meat, carries a high risk of infection from pathogens that may cause disease in humans. Animal products that are processed appropriately through cooking or pasteurization are safe for consumption. Foods that have gone through these processes should be handled with care to avoid cross contamination with uncooked/unsafe foods. Camel meat and camel milk are nutritious products that can continue to be consumed after cooking, pasteurization or other thermal treatments. WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry regarding this event, nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.",

        "Date Reported": "23 August 2023",
        "Location": "Chile",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 12 August 2023, the IHR National Focal Point of Chile notified WHO of a confirmed case of measles in the Metropolitan Region. The case had history of travel to Georgia, where measles is endemic, and Armenia, where measles has been eliminated, and returning to Chile via Qatar and Brazil. To date no further cases related to this importation have been detected.\nThis is the first measles case reported in Chile since 2020. As soon as the case was notified, the local and national authorities implemented control measures, including case isolation and an epidemiological investigation to identify the exposed contacts and refer them for vaccination, and reinforced surveillance activities in the public and private health network.\nMeasles is a highly contagious acute viral disease but can be prevented by immunization. Chile interrupted local transmission of measles in 1993. Imported cases are expected, and the susceptibility of contacts determines the spread of the disease.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 12 August 2023, IHR National Focal Point of Chile notified WHO of a confirmed case of measles in the Metropolitan Region. The patient is a 42-year-old male from Chile with a history of travel to Armenia and Georgia (between 16 July and 26 July, returning to Chile on 26 July via Qatar and Brazil), and no history of vaccination against measles. This is the first imported case of measles reported in Chile since 2020.On 7 August 2023, the patient presented with symptoms consistent with chills, myalgias, fever and malaise, twelve days after his return to Chile. On 8 August 2023, the case developed a rash (13 days after return) and on 9 and 10 August, he sought medical attention in two different health care facilities.On 10 August 2023, serum and urine samples were collected and tested reactive for measles by IgM and PCR at a private clinic laboratory. On 11 August 2023, the samples were sent to the Public Health Institute of Chile, the national reference laboratory, where they tested reactive for measles by IgM and PCR on the same day. The patient did not require hospitalization, and as of 17 August, his progress has been favourable.The patient has been in contact with about a thousand people through exposures at home, work, school, in waiting rooms of health facilities and others. As of 17 August, the contacts are under follow-up, and 325 contacts have received a dose of MMR, or standard immunoglobulin (for special groups), in the context of this outbreak, other contacts have accredited vaccination (National Immunization Registry- RNI per its acronym in Spanish or vaccination certificate) of two doses against measles, and the rest are still in the referral process to complete the missing doses.In Chile, the current vaccination scheme considers the administration of two doses of measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine: the first dose at 12 months of life and the second dose at 36 months of age. Official measles immunization coverage in Chile with the first dose for MMR vaccine was 93.9% in 2022 and was 52.9% as of epidemiological week 26 of 2023, being below the percentage of sustained homogeneous coverage of at least 95% recommended by the WHO.\u00a0According to WHO/UNICEF National Immunization Coverage (WEUNIC) estimates, Chile's vaccination coverage with two doses of measles-containing vaccine (MCV2) was less than 60% over the past two years. In addition, within this national coverage, there are subnational variations (rural and peripheral urban areas) which could include pockets of unvaccinated people in all age groups.",
        "Epidemiology": "Measles is a highly contagious acute viral disease, which affects susceptible individuals of all ages and remains one of the leading causes of death among young children globally. The mode of transmission is airborne or via droplets from the nose, mouth, or throat of infected persons.Early symptoms of measles are fever (as high as 40\u00b0C) and malaise, cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis, followed by a rash with both raised and flat areas (maculopapular rash). The rash usually appears 14 days after exposure and spreads from the head to the trunk to the lower extremities. A patient is infectious from four days before up to four days after the appearance of the rash. There is no specific antiviral treatment for measles and most people recover within 2-3 weeks.Measles is usually a mild or moderately severe disease. However, measles can lead to complications such as pneumonia, inflammation of brain (encephalitis), and death. Postinfectious encephalitis can occur in about one in every 1000 reported cases of measles. About two or three deaths may occur for every 1000 reported cases of measles.Among malnourished children and immunocompromised people including people with HIV, cancer and treated with immunosuppressives, as well as pregnant women, measles can also cause serious complications, including blindness, encephalitis, severe diarrhoea, ear infection, and pneumonia.Measles can be prevented by immunization. In countries with low vaccination coverage, epidemics typically occur every two to three years and usually last between two and three months, although their duration varies according to population size, crowding, and the population\u2019s immunity status.",
        "Public Health Response": "The following public health measures were implemented by local and national health authorities:Intensification of epidemiological surveillance with active and retrospective institutional search for cases.Identification and follow-up of contacts for 21 days post-exposure.Vaccination of contacts if there was no immunization record.Use of standard immunoglobulin in the population at risk.Notification, through IHR NFPs, of contacts who travelled to other countries.Sending information to the IHR NFP of Georgia and Armenia for follow-up.Additionally, during the second semester of this year, the updated strategy for students from 1st to 8th grade will be implemented in Chile\u00a0[1].",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Measles remains one of the leading causes of death among young children worldwide. It is highly contagious, with 90% of non-immune people exposed to an infectious individual estimated to contract the disease. \u00a0In 2016, the Region of the Americas was the first Region of WHO to be declared free of endemic transmission of measles viruses by the International Expert Committee (IEC) for\u00a0Documenting and Verifying Measles, Rubella and the Congenital Rubella Syndrome in the Americas.\u00a0Nevertheless, maintaining the Region free of measles is an ongoing challenge due to the permanent risk of importation and reintroduction of the virus. This case corresponds to a susceptible cohort of people born between 1971 and 1981 who were not immunized with two doses of MMR or did not previously present with the disease.During the COVID-19 pandemic, there might be a risk of disruption to routine immunization activities due to both COVID-19 related burden on the health system and decreased demand for vaccination because of physical distancing requirements or community reluctance. Disruption of immunization services even for a short time can result in increased numbers of susceptible individuals and raise the likelihood of outbreak-prone vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) such as measles.",
        "WHO Advice": "Measles anywhere is a problem everywhere because it spreads so easily. WHO recommends that countries in all regions continue to make progress towards achieving measles elimination in line with each of the endorsed Regional Goals of all WHO regions to achieve measles elimination, as well as the global strategy under IA2030, the Measles and Rubella Strategic Framework. WHO recommends strengthening the efforts to implement the \"Plan of Action for the Sustainability of Measles, Rubella, and Congenital Rubella Syndrome Elimination in the Americas 2018-2023\", with its four strategic sections: 1) guarantee universal access to vaccination services; 2) strengthen the capacity of epidemiological surveillance systems for measles, rubella, and congenital rubella syndrome; 3) develop the national operational capacity to maintain the elimination status; 4) establish standard mechanisms for rapid response to imported measles, rubella, and congenital rubella syndrome cases to prevent the re-establishment of endemic transmission in the countries.WHO recommends strengthening epidemiological surveillance in high-traffic border areas to rapidly detect and respond to highly suspected measles cases. Providing a rapid response to imported measles cases to avoid the establishment of endemic transmission through the activation of rapid response teams trained for this purpose and by implementing national rapid response protocols when there are imported cases. Once a rapid response team has been activated, continued coordination between the national, sub-national and local levels must be ensured, with permanent communication channels between all levels. During outbreaks, it is recommended to establish adequate hospital case management to avoid nosocomial transmission, with appropriate referral of patients to isolation rooms (for any level of care) and avoiding contact with other patients in waiting rooms and/or other hospital rooms.WHO recommends vaccination of at-risk populations without proof of vaccination or immunity against measles and rubella, such as health care workers, persons working in tourism and transportation (hotels, airports, border crossings, mass transportation, and others), and international travellers who are visiting measles endemic countries. Implementing a plan to immunize migrant populations in high-traffic border areas, prioritizing those considered at-risk, including both migrants and residents, in these municipalities increases vaccination coverage to increase population immunity.In all settings consideration should be given to providing susceptible contacts with post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), including a dose of MCV or normal human immunoglobulin (NHIG) (if available) for those at risk and in whom the vaccine is contraindicated. In well-resourced settings, MCV should be provided to susceptible contacts within 3 days. For contacts for whom vaccination is contraindicated or is not possible within 3 days post-exposure, consideration can be given to providing NHIG up to 6 days post-exposure. Infants, pregnant women, and the immunocompromised should be prioritized.WHO recommends maintaining sustained homogeneous coverage of at least 95% with the first and second doses of the MCV vaccine in all municipalities and strengthening integrated epidemiological surveillance of measles and rubella to achieve timely detection of all suspected cases in public, private, and social security healthcare facilities.WHO recommends maintaining a stock of the measles-rubella (MR)and/or measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine, and syringes/supplies for control actions of imported cases. Facilitating the access to vaccination services according to the national scheme to foreigners or people from the same country who perform temporary activities in countries with ongoing outbreaks; displaced populations; indigenous populations, or other vulnerable populations.WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel and trade to Chile based on the information available on the current outbreak.",

        "Outbreak name": "Influenza A (H1N2) variant virus",
        "Date Reported": "11 August 2023",
        "Location": "United States of America",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 4 August 2023, the United States International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Point informed PAHO/WHO of a human infection with a novel influenza A(H1N2) variant virus identified in the State of Michigan. This was confirmed by Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction at the United States (US) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on August 2.\nThe case was not hospitalized and is recovering from the illness. Investigations by local public health officials identified swine exposure by the patient at an agricultural fair.\nAdditional public health response efforts including enhanced surveillance for cases is undergoing. Given the potential impact on public health, human infections with these viruses need to be monitored closely. In this event, there was no reported evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission, the illness was mild and no further influenza variant virus transmission in the community has been identified.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 4 August 2023, the United States IHR National Focal Point informed PAHO/WHO of a human infection with a novel influenza A(H1N2) variant virus identified in the State of Michigan and confirmed by the US CDC.\u00a0 According to the report, the case is under 18 years old, with no comorbidities, resident in the State of Michigan, who developed respiratory illness on 29 July 2023. The case presented with fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches, headache, shortness of breath, diarrhea, nausea, dizziness, and lethargy. On 29 July, the case sought medical care at an emergency department, and an upper respiratory tract specimen was collected on 30 July. The specimen tested positive for influenza A virus on the same day. On 1 August, the patient received influenza antiviral treatment (Oseltamivir).On 31 July, the specimen was tested at the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS), and RT-PCR results were positive for influenza A virus but lacked reactivity with diagnostic tests for contemporary human influenza viruses representing either (H1) pdm09 or (H3) subtypes. The specimen was then sent to the US CDC for further testing and received on 2 August. On the same day, RT-PCR analysis of the specimen indicated an influenza A(H1N2) variant (v) virus. The virus was isolated and subsequent analysis including genetic sequencing is underway.The case was not hospitalized. Investigation by local public health officials identified swine exposure by the patient at an agricultural fair, that took place between 23 and 29 July, within 10 days prior to illness onset. Additional investigation did not identify respiratory illness in any of the patient\u2019s close contacts or household contacts. No additional cases were identified related to this agriculture fair. No person-to-person transmission of influenza A(H1N2)v virus associated with this case has been identified. No additional cases of human infection with A(H1N2)v virus have been identified as of 10 August 2023.This is the first influenza A(H1N2)v virus infection identified in the United States this year. Since 2005, there have been 512 influenza A variant virus infections (all subtypes), including 37 (human infections with influenza A (H1N2)v viruses reported in the United States.",
        "Epidemiology": "Swine influenza A(H1N2) viruses circulate in swine populations in many regions of the world. Influenza A viruses that normally circulate in swine are called \u201cvariant\u201d influenza viruses when isolated from humans.1\u00a0Human infections are usually due to direct or indirect exposure to pigs or contaminated environments. There may be important antigenic and genetic differences between seasonal influenza viruses that circulate worldwide in the human population and influenza viruses that normally circulate in swine. Close monitoring is needed\u00a0to early identify changes in the virus and/or its transmission to humans.2Non-seasonal or zoonotic influenza viruses infecting humans may cause disease ranging from mild conjunctivitis to severe pneumonia and even death; usually, these human infections of zoonotic influenza are acquired through direct contact with infected animals or contaminated environments. Since 2005, 37 human infections with influenza A(H1N2)v virus, including this one, have been reported in the United States.",
        "Public Health Response": "The public health response efforts led by local officials included enhanced surveillance for cases. The county health department conducted active case finding by reaching out to fair exhibitors and their families to ascertain additional illnesses.\u00a0 In addition, local providers were notified to watch for respiratory illness in persons who had attended the fair or had recent contact with swine.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Swine influenza A viruses circulate in swine populations in many regions of the world. Depending on geographic location, the genetic characteristics of these viruses differ. When an influenza A virus that normally circulates in swine (but not people) is detected in a person, it is called a \u201cvariant influenza virus\u201d. Most human cases are the result of exposure to swine influenza A viruses through contact with infected swine or contaminated environments. Because these viruses continue to be detected in swine populations around the world, further human cases can be expected.According to the IHR, a human infection caused by a novel influenza A virus subtype is an event that has the potential for high public health impact. A novel influenza A virus is considered to have the potential to cause a pandemic if (1) the virus has demonstrated the capacity to infect and transmit efficiently among humans, and (2) differs from currently circulating seasonal human influenza viruses (i.e., A/H1 or A/H3), circulating widely in the human population such that the hemagglutinin (HA) gene (or protein) is not a mutated form of those; and (3) the population has little to no immunity against it. To date, only sporadic human infections caused by influenza A(H3N2), A(H1N1) and A(H1N2) variant viruses have been reported in the United States, and there has been no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission. Human infections with influenza variant viruses tend to result in mild clinical illness, although some cases have been hospitalized with more severe disease. Given the potential impact on public health, human infections with these viruses need to be monitored closely. In this event, there was no reported evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission, the illness was mild and no further influenza variant virus transmission in the community has been identified. There has been some limited, non-sustained human-to-human transmission of variant influenza A viruses, although ongoing community transmission has not been identified. Current evidence suggests that these viruses have not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans. The risk assessment will be reviewed if needed should further epidemiological or virological information become available. Influenza A viruses that infect pigs are different from human influenza A viruses. Currently, there is no vaccine for Influenza A(H1N2)v infection licensed for use in humans. Thus, influenza vaccines against human influenza viruses are generally not expected to protect people from influenza viruses that normally circulate in pigs.",
        "WHO Advice": "This case does not change the current WHO recommendations on public health measures and surveillance of seasonal influenza.WHO does not advise special traveller screening at points of entry or restrictions with regards to the current situation of influenza viruses at the human-animal interface. For recommendations on safe trade in animals and related products from countries affected by these influenza viruses, refer to\u00a0WOAH guidance.\u00a0The public should avoid contact with animals that are sick or dead from unknown causes, including wild animals, and should report dead wild birds and mammals or request their removal by contacting local wildlife or veterinary authorities.WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of animal influenza should avoid farms, contact with animals in live animal markets, entering areas where animals may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with animal excreta. Travelers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. All individuals should follow good food safety and hygiene practices.\u00a0Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect virologic, epidemiologic and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health and timely virus sharing for risk assessment. Continued vigilance is needed within affected and neighbouring areas to detect infections in animals and humans. Collaboration between the animal and human health sectors is essential. As the extent of influenza viruses circulation in animals is not clear, epidemiologic and virologic surveillance and the follow-up of suspected human cases should continue systematically. Guidance on investigation of non-seasonal influenza and other emerging acute respiratory diseases has been published on the WHO website\u00a0here.Vigilance for the emergence of novel influenza viruses of pandemic potential should be maintained. WHO has developed practical guidance for integrated surveillance in the context of the cocirculation of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses. The guidance is available\u00a0here.All human infections caused by a new subtype of influenza virus are notifiable under the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005). State Parties to the IHR (2005) are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic. Evidence of illness is not required for this report.\u00a0It is critical that these influenza viruses from animals or from people are fully characterized in appropriate animal or human health influenza reference laboratories. Under WHO\u2019s Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework, Member States are expected to share Influenza Viruses with Pandemic Potential (IVPP) on a regular and timely basis with the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), a WHO-coordinated network of public health laboratories. The viruses are used by the public health laboratories to assess the risk of pandemic influenza and to develop relevant candidate vaccine viruses.",

        "Outbreak name": "Dengue",
        "Date Reported": "11 August 2023",
        "Location": "Bangladesh",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "From 1 January to 7 August 2023, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of Bangladesh reported a total of 69 483 laboratory-confirmed dengue cases and 327 related deaths, with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 0.47%. Of these, 63% of cases and 62% of the deaths were reported in the month of July 2023. Although dengue is endemic in Bangladesh, the current dengue surge is unusual in terms of seasonality and the early sharp increase in comparison to previous years, where the surge started around -late June. The CFR so far this year is relatively high compared to previous years for the full-year period. The pre-monsoon Aedes survey shows that the density of mosquitoes, and the number of potential hotspots is at the highest level in the past five years.\nThe higher incidence of dengue is taking place in the context of an unusual episodic amount of rainfall, combined with high temperatures and high humidity, which have resulted in an increased mosquito population throughout Bangladesh.",
        "Description of the Situation": "Between 1 January and 7 August 2023, a total of 69 483 dengue cases including 327 related deaths (case fatality rate = 0.47%) were reported by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW). As of\u00a030 June\u00a02023, a total of\u00a07978 cases and 47 deaths were reported, however, the cases started surging rapidly from late June and in the month of July alone 63% of cases (n=43 854) and 62% of deaths (n= 204) were reported.\u00a0The number of cases and deaths are higher compared to similar periods in the past five years (Figure 1). Dengue cases started to rise in\u00a0May 2023 and have been continuing since then, and\u00a0the peak is unlikely to have been reached.\u00a0The reported number of dengue cases this year is the highest compared to the same periods recorded since 2000. The cases are reported from all\u00a064\u00a0districts in the\u00a0country.\u00a0 Cases\u00a0in Dhaka division\u00a0started to increase in epidemic week 17 (23-29 April 2023) and in all eight divisions since epidemic week 26 (25 June to 1 July 2023).\u00a0 The most affected area in the Dhaka division is Dhaka city corporation, accounting for 52.8% of cases and 78.9% of deaths. Other affected divisions include Chattogram division (13.2% of cases and 9.2% of deaths), Dhaka division\u00a0excluding Dhaka city\u00a0(11.6% of cases and\u00a02.8% of deaths), and Barisal division (10.5% of cases and 4.3% of deaths). The Sylhet division has\u00a0the lowest number of cases\u00a0(560) and no deaths\u00a0reported so far.As of 7 August 2023, the\u00a0reported CFR is 0.47%, which\u00a0is\u00a0higher\u00a0compared to previous years (table 1).\u00a0On further analysis,\u00a0the overall CFR is higher in females than in males (0.72% v 0.32%) with females having four times higher CFR than males\u00a0among those aged 21-40 years\u00a0(0.71% vs 0.18%). The older age group recorded\u00a0a\u00a0higher CFR compared to\u00a0the\u00a0younger age group (1.87% in the age group over 60 years compared to 0.74% in the age group between 41 to 60 years and 0.34% in those aged 40 years and below). DENV2 was the predominant circulating serotype in Bangladesh until 2018, when it was replaced by DENV3 as the predominant serotype since 2019.\u00a0\u00a0However, DENV2 has been identified as the primary circulating serotype in this outbreak, and this may result in more severe dengue infections and hospitalizations as a result of a second infection with a heterologous serotype. Of the 66 serotyped samples in\u00a0the month of June 2023, DENV2 (51.5%) and DENV3 (43.9%) were identified as the circulating serotypes.Figure 1. Number of dengue cases (A) and deaths (B) reported by epidemic week from 2018 to 2023 [as of 5 August (epidemiological week 31) 2023]\u00a0Table 1: Dengue cases, deaths, and case fatality rate in Bangladesh for 2018, 2019, 2021, 2022 and 2023\u00a0\u00a0 Data source: DGHS\u00a0(*data for 2020 is limited due to COVID-19)",
        "Epidemiology": "Dengue is a viral infection transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes and is found in tropical and sub-tropical climates worldwide, mostly in urban and semi-urban areas. The primary vectors that transmit the disease are\u00a0Aedes aegypti\u00a0mosquitoes and, to a lesser extent,\u00a0Aedes albopictus.Dengue virus (DENV) has four serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4). Infection with one serotype provides long-term immunity to the homologous serotype but not to the other serotypes; sequential infections with a different serotype put people at greater risk for severe dengue. Many DENV infections produce only mild flu-like illness and over 80% of cases are asymptomatic.There is no specific treatment for dengue; however, the timely detection of cases, identifying any warning signs of severe dengue infection, and appropriate case management are key elements of care to lower case fatality rates to less than 1%.Dengue was first recorded in the 1960s in Bangladesh (then known as East Pakistan) and was known as \u201cDacca fever\u201d. Since 2010 cases of dengue appear to coincide with the rainy season from May to September and higher temperatures. Bangladesh\u2019s climate conditions are becoming more favorable for the transmission of dengue and other vector-borne diseases including malaria and chikungunya virus due to excessive rainfall, waterlogging, flooding, rise in temperature and the unusual shifts in the country\u2019s traditional seasons.",
        "Public Health Response": "The high number of reported cases has put pressure on the health systems and\u00a0the\u00a0Directorate General of Health Services has taken the following actions:CoordinationA coordination committee has been set up under the Director Disease Control & Line Director Communicable Disease Control (CDC) of the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) of Bangladesh\u00a0to oversee\u00a0the response.A Dengue Control Room has been formed (Secretariat) for coordination and data collection at the central level.\u00a0Additionally, there are Activated Control Rooms in all district and Medical College hospitals.Health system strengthening for case management:Six hospitals assigned for the management of COVID-19 patients in Dhaka city have been repurposed for dengue case management.\u00a0Additionally, dedicated dengue wards/dengue corners have been established in Medical College hospitals.\u00a0The fourth edition of the National Guideline for Clinical Management of Dengue Syndrome has been updated and instructions were given to all Government and Private Hospitals to follow the guideline.There is ongoing\u00a0capacity building on the clinical management of dengue for doctors and nurses across the country.\u00a0Pocket\u00a0guidelines for dengue have been distributed to health care staff.\u00a0Intravenous saline and other supportive medicines,\u00a0have been supplied to health facilities across the country.\u00a0Strengthening surveillance:The hospital-based surveillance system is actively collecting regular information from 57 hospitals in Dhaka city as well as all Upazila and district-level hospitals. Daily reports are also disseminated through the Health Emergency Operation Center (HEOC).\u00a0\u00a0Risk communication and community engagement:Mass awareness campaigns have been strengthened via television and other mass media methods including digital media, leaflets and posters. Community awareness is also provided by the local ward counsellors. The city corporations have informed all buildings under construction to prevent water collection and fines have been imposed on buildings where the\u00a0Aedes\u00a0larvae have been found.\u00a0Advocacy and awareness meetings are ongoing in highly affected wards of Dhaka city corporation by the Aedes Transmitted Disease Control Program and IHR, Migration Health, and Emerging Reemerging Disease Control Program under CDC-DGHS.\u00a0Laboratory:Dengue\u00a0serotyping\u00a0has been conducted.A total of\u00a0184 000 non-structural protein (NS1) diagnostic kits have been distributed to all Upazila health complexes, district hospitals and medical college hospitals.Vector control activities: The local government engineering department (LGED) is leading vector control activities including the elimination of mosquito breeding sites and larvicidal and adult mosquito control using different insecticides such as\u00a0Temephos and Deltamethrin.Post Monsoon Aedes Survey was carried out in all wards of Dhaka North and Dhaka South city corporation between 26 January 2023 to 4 February 2023. The results were disseminated to concerned stakeholders on 13 April 2023.A\u00a0Pre-Monsoon Aedes Survey started on 18 June 2023 and was completed on 27 June 2023. The results were disseminated to both city corporations on 4 July 2023.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Dengue is endemic in Bangladesh\u00a0with recurrent outbreaks and is one of the major public health concerns in Bangladesh.\u00a0Dengue virus has the potential to cause epidemics resulting in high morbidity and mortality.\u202fAll four serotypes of the dengue virus have been reported in Bangladesh with the predominance of DENV 1 and DENV2 until 2016. Since 2019, when the largest dengue outbreak was reported, DENV3 has been the predominant serotype, while this year DENV2 has become the predominant serotype.\u00a0\u00a0There is no specific treatment for cases and clinical management is based on supportive therapy however, the early\u00a0detection of infection and appropriate clinical management of patients can reduce the severity of disease and mortality The prevention and control of dengue depends on vector control.\u00a0A dengue\u00a0vaccine has not been approved in Bangladesh. The\u00a0dengue risk at the national level is assessed as \u2018High\u2019 due to the ongoing rapidly increasing number of cases and deaths with the peak not yet reached, the high CFR compared to the previous years and the increasing geographical distribution of cases. In addition, DENV2 has been identified as the predominant circulating serotype, following four years of DENV3 predominating which may result in higher numbers of severe cases as a result of a second infection with a heterologous serotype. Furthermore, there is some pressure on the healthcare capacity due to the very high number of admissions for dengue; high vector density; and an anticipated prolonged monsoon.Bangladesh has three international airports, three seaports and twenty-three land ports. Bangladesh shares 94% of its land border with India with frequent population movement across the land crossing, however, dengue is already endemic in India including the eastern Indian states which share land borders with Bangladesh and where Aedes mosquitoes breed and circulate. Climate change along with heavy rains in neighboring countries increase the likelihood of vector-borne disease transmission. Due to social and economic factors, many people migrate from Bangladesh to other countries thereby increasing the risk of international disease spread. Bangladesh receives a large volume of international tourists, and the possibility of travellers acquiring the disease and contributing to its further spread outside the country cannot be ruled out.",
        "WHO Advice": "The proximity of mosquito vector breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for\u00a0dengue virus infection. Aedes\u00a0species mosquitoes can become infected with the virus after biting\u00a0DENV-infected individuals and then pass the virus onto other individuals within the vicinity. This cycle, therefore, makes the infective mosquito capable of spreading the dengue virus within households and in the neighbourhood, leading to clusters of cases.\u00a0The prevention and control of the DENV, virus that causes dengue,\u00a0depends on effective vector control. Vector control activities should focus on all areas where there is a risk of human-vector contact such as the place of residence, workplaces, schools, and hospitals. WHO promotes a strategic approach known as Integrated Vector Management (IVM) to control mosquito vectors, including\u00a0Aedes\u00a0species, the vector of dengue. IVM should be enhanced to remove potential breeding sites, reduce vector populations, and minimize individual exposure. This should involve vector control strategies for larvae and adults (i.e. environmental management and source reduction, especially of water storage practices, and include covering, draining and cleaning household water storage containers on a weekly basis;\u00a0larvicide in non-potable water using WHO-prequalified larvicides at correct dosages,\u00a0distribution of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) for fever/dengue inpatients to contain spread of virus from health facilities, as well as strategies for protecting people and households. Indoor space spraying (fogging) is another approach for rapid containment of dengue\u00a0infected mosquitoes but may be challenging to deliver in densely populated areas such as camps.\u00a0Personal protective measures during outdoor activities include the topical application of repellents to exposed skin or treatment of clothing, and the use of long sleeves shirts and pants. Additionally, in indoors protection can include the use of household insecticide aerosol products, or mosquito coils during the day. Window and door screens, as well as air conditioning can reduce the probability of mosquitoes entering the house. Insecticide-treated nets offer good protection to people against mosquito bites while sleeping. Since\u00a0Aedes\u00a0mosquitoes (the primary vector for transmission) are active at dawn and dusk, personal protective measures are recommended particularly at these times of day.\u00a0Entomological surveillance should be undertaken to assess the breeding potential of\u00a0Aedes\u00a0mosquitoes in containers as well as to monitor insecticide resistance to help select most effective insecticide-based interventions. Insecticide resistance test kits produced by a WHO-coordinated facility in Universiti Sains Malaysia should be procured.There is no specific treatment for dengue infection, but early detection and access to\u00a0appropriate healthcare for case management can reduce mortality. Rapid detection of severe dengue cases and timely referrals to tertiary hospitals can reduce mortality. Case surveillance should continue to be enhanced in all affected areas and across the country. Where feasible, resources should be allocated for the strengthening of a sample referral mechanism for the confirmation and sub-typing of dengue virus.\u00a0WHO does not recommend that any general travel or trade restrictions be applied\u00a0to Bangladesh based on the information available for this event.",

        "Outbreak name": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus",
        "Date Reported": "24 July 2023",
        "Location": "United Arab Emirates",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 10 July 2023, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), notified WHO of a case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in a 28-year-old male from Al Ain city in Abu Dhabi. The case had no history of direct or indirect contact with dromedaries, goats, or sheep. The patient was admitted to the hospital on 8 June. A nasopharyngeal swab was collected on 21 June and tested positive for MERS-CoV by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on 23 June 2023. All 108 identified contacts were monitored for 14 days from the last date of exposure to the MERS-CoV patient. No secondary cases have been detected to date.\nSince July 2013, when the UAE reported the first case of MERS-CoV, 94 confirmed cases (including this new case) and 12 deaths have been reported. Globally, the total number of confirmed MERS-CoV cases reported to WHO since 2012 is 2605, including 936 associated deaths.\nWHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessments based on the latest available information. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East and/or other countries where MERS-CoV is circulating in dromedaries.\nWHO re-emphasizes the importance of strong surveillance by all Member States for acute respiratory infections, including MERS-CoV, and to carefully review any unusual patterns.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 10 July 2023, the International Health Regulations National Focal Point (IHR NFP) of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) notified WHO of a confirmed case of MERS-CoV in Abu Dhabi. The patient is\u00a0a 28-year-old male, non- Emirati national living in Al Ain city, a non-healthcare worker. \u00a0The case visited a private medical center multiple times between 3 and 7 June 2023, complaining of vomiting, right flank pain, and dysuria (pain when passing urine). On 8 June, the case presented to a government hospital with vomiting, and gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhea, and was given an initial diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, acute kidney injury, and sepsis. On 13 June, he was in critical condition and referred to an intensive care unit (ICU) at a specialized government tertiary hospital where he was put on mechanical ventilation. He deteriorated and a nasopharyngeal swab was collected on 21 June and tested positive for MERS-CoV by PCR on 23 June 2023.The case has no known co-morbidities, no history of contact with MERS-CoV human cases, and no recent travel outside the UAE. The patient has no known history of direct contact with animals including dromedary camels, nor consumption of their raw products. All 108 contacts that were identified have been monitored for 14 days from the last date of exposure to the MERS-CoV patient, no secondary case was identified. The case has no family members or household contacts identified in the UAE.Prior to this notification, the last MERS-CoV infection reported from the UAE was in November 2021. The first laboratory-confirmed case of MERS-CoV in UAE was in July 2013. Since then, the UAE has reported 94 cases of MERS-CoV (including this current case) and 12 associated deaths (Case Fatality Ratio (CFR): 13%).",
        "Epidemiology": "Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory infection that is caused by a coronavirus called Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedary camels who are the natural host and zoonotic source of the MERS-CoV infection.MERS-CoV infections range from asymptomatic or mild respiratory symptoms to severe acute respiratory disease and death. A typical presentation of a person with MERS-CoV disease is fever, cough and shortness of breath. Pneumonia is a common finding, but not always present. Gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhoea, have also been reported. The virus appears to cause more severe disease in older people, persons with weakened immune systems and those with chronic diseases such as renal disease, cancer, chronic lung disease, and diabetes. Severe illness can cause respiratory failure that requires mechanical ventilation and support in an intensive care unit resulting in high mortality.No vaccine or specific treatment is currently available, although several MERS-CoV-specific vaccines and treatments are in development. Treatment is supportive and based on the patient\u2019s clinical condition.",
        "Public Health Response": "A total of 108 contacts from health care facilities were identified and screened for MERS-CoV (56 from the first government hospital and 52 from the second government hospital) all of which were health care workers (HCWs), screening for exposed HCWs was repeated by respiratory samples, all results were negative.All 108 identified contacts were monitored for 14 days from the last date of exposure to the MERS-CoV patient, and no secondary cases have been detected to date.Abu Dhabi Public Health Centre (ADPHC) has updated the case definition for MERS-CoV, strengthened surveillance activities to identify possible cases, conducted several workshops and issued circulars for MERS-CoV.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory infection of humans and dromedary camels which is caused by a coronavirus called the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease in humans resulting in high mortality. Approximately 35% of patients with MERS-CoV have died, but this may be an overestimate of the true mortality rate, as mild cases of MERS-CoV may be missed by existing surveillance systems. Until more is known about the disease, the case fatality rates are counted only amongst the laboratory-confirmed cases reported to WHO. Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedaries, a host and zoonotic source of MERS-CoV infection. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to be transmitted between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts and in healthcare settings.\u00a0Outside of the healthcare setting, there has been limited human-to-human transmission. Cases of MERS-CoV infection are rare in the UAE. Since July 2013, a total of 94 MERS-CoV cases, including this current case, resulting in 12 deaths (CFR 13%) have been reported to WHO from the UAE.Globally, the total number of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases reported to WHO since 2012 is 2605, including 936 associated deaths as of July 2023. The majority of the reported cases have occurred in countries in the Arabian Peninsula. Outside of this region, there has been one large outbreak in the Republic of Korea, in May 2015, during which 186 laboratory-confirmed cases (185 in the Republic of Korea and one in China) and 38 deaths were reported. The global number reflects the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths reported to WHO under IHR (2005) to date.The notification of this case does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East and/or other countries where MERS-CoV is circulating in dromedaries, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who were exposed to the virus through contact with dromedaries or their products (for example, consumption of camel\u2019s raw milk), or in a healthcare setting. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessments based on the latest available information.",
        "WHO Advice": "Based on the current situation and available information, WHO re-emphasizes the importance of strong surveillance by all Member States for acute respiratory infections, including MERS-CoV, and to carefully review any unusual patterns.Given that this latest case presents with severe disease but has no comorbidities and no exposure history to camels, camel raw products or MERS-CoV human case, it will be important to sequence the virus and conduct genomic analysis to screen for any unusual patterns. The process for genomic analysis has begun. This will identify any genetic evolution of the virus and support WHO\u2019s global risk assessment efforts.\u00a0 As a general precaution, anyone visiting farms, markets, barns or other places where dromedaries are present should practice general hygiene measures, including regular hand washing after touching animals, avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with hands, and avoiding contact with sick animals. People may also consider wearing protective gowns and gloves while professionally handling animals.The consumption of raw or undercooked animal products, including milk, meat, blood and urine, carries a high risk of infection from a variety of organisms that might cause disease in humans. Animal products processed appropriately through proper cooking or pasteurization are safe for consumption but should also be handled carefully to avoid cross-contamination with uncooked foods. Human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV in healthcare settings has been associated with delays in recognizing the early symptoms of MERS-CoV infection, slow triage of suspected cases and delays in implementing infection, prevention and control (IPC) measures. IPC measures are therefore critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV between people in health-care facilities. Health -care facilities should ensure environmental and engineering controls are in place including adequate ventilation, spatial separation of at least one meter between patients and others, including health and care workers and adequate environmental cleaning. Health care workers should consistently apply standard precautions to all patients at every interaction in healthcare settings. Droplet precautions, including eye protection, should be applied in addition to standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol-generating procedures or in settings where aerosol-generating procedures are conducted. Early identification, case management and isolation of cases, quarantine of contacts, appropriate infection prevention and control measures in health care settings, and public health awareness can prevent human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV.MERS-CoV appears to cause more severe disease in people with underlying chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and in immunocompromised persons. Therefore, people with these underlying medical conditions should avoid close contact with animals, particularly dromedaries, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.",

        "Date Reported": "19 July 2023",
        "Location": "the Region of the Americas",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "Since the beginning of 2023, dengue outbreaks of significant magnitude have been recorded in the WHO Region of the Americas, with close to three million suspected and confirmed cases of dengue reported so far this year, surpassing the 2.8 million cases of dengue registered for the entire year of 2022. Of the total number of dengue cases reported until 1 July 2023 (2 997 097 cases), 45% were laboratory confirmed, and 0.13% were classified as severe dengue. The highest number of dengue cases to date in 2023 are in Brazil, Peru, and Bolivia. Additionally, 1302 deaths were reported in the Region with a Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of 0.04%, in the same period.\nAs part of the implementation of the Integrated Management Strategy for the Prevention and Control of Arboviral Diseases (IMS-Arbovirus), WHO is actively working with the Member States to strengthen healthcare and surveillance capacity.\nWHO has assessed the risk of dengue as high at the regional level due to the wide spread distribution of the Aedes spp. mosquitoes (especially Aedes aegypti), the continued risk of severe disease and death, and the expansion out of historical areas of transmission, where all the population, including risk groups and healthcare workers, may not be aware of warning signs.\nWHO does not recommend any travel and/or trade restrictions for countries in the Americas experiencing the current dengue epidemics based on the currently available information.",
        "Description of the Situation": "Dengue is the arbovirus that causes the highest number of cases in the Region of the Americas, with epidemics occurring cyclically every 3 to 5 years. During the first half of 2023, dengue outbreaks of significant magnitude were recorded in South America.\u00a0 Between epidemiological week (EW) 1 and EW 26 of 2023 (week ending on 01 July), a total of 2 997 097 cases of dengue were reported in the Region of the Americas, including 1302 deaths with a CFR of 0.04%, with a cumulative incidence rate of 305 cases per 100 000 population. Of the total number of dengue cases until EW 26 of 2023, 1 348 234 (45%) were laboratory confirmed, and 3907 (0.13%) were classified as severe dengue.1 The highest number of dengue cases was observed in Brazil, with 2 376 522 cases, followed by Peru with 188 326 cases, and Bolivia with 133 779 cases.The highest cumulative incidence rates were observed in the following subregions: the Southern Cone2 with 862 cases per 100 000 inhabitants, the Andean Subregion3 with 268 cases per 100 000 inhabitants, and the Central American Isthmus and Mexico4 with 59 cases per 100 000 inhabitants.The highest number of severe dengue cases was observed in the following countries: Brazil with 1249 cases, Peru with 701 cases, Colombia with 683 cases, Bolivia with 591 cases and Mexico with 141 cases. All four dengue virus serotypes (DENV1, DENV2, DENV3, and DENV4) are present in the Region of the Americas. In 2023, up to EW 26 (ending on 1 July), simultaneous circulation of all four serotypes has been detected in Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, and Venezuela; while in Argentina, Panama, Peru, and Puerto Rico, DENV1, DENV2 and DENV3 serotypes circulate, and in Nicaragua the serotypes DENV1, DENV3 and DENV4.In 2022, 2 811 433 dengue cases were reported in the Region of the Americas, the third highest year on record, only surpassed by 2016 and 2019. In 2019, the highest number of historical dengue cases was registered, with more than 3.1 million cases for the Region of the Americas, including 28 203 severe cases and 1823 deaths.Between 12 June to 1 July 2023, some countries in the Southern Cone and the Andean subregion have been showing a decrease in the number of cases due to multiple factors, including, the implementation of control measures, and the change in temperature and climate, mainly in the Southern Cone. There is also a delay in the notification of data from some countries in Central America and the Caribbean. These have resulted in a decline in cases and the downward trend observed in the epidemiological curve below. Figure 1.

        "Epidemiology": "Dengue is a viral infection that spreads from mosquitoes to people. It is more common in tropical and subtropical climates. Most people who get dengue won\u2019t have symptoms. But for those that do, the most common symptoms are high fever, headache, body aches, nausea and rash. Most people will get better in 1\u20132 weeks, however, some people develop severe dengue which includes shock or respiratory distress due to plasma leakage, severe bleeding, organ impairment, and death.In severe cases, dengue can be fatal. The risk of dengue can be avoided by avoiding mosquito bites especially during the day. There is currently no specific treatment for dengue, therefore, case management focuses on managing pain symptoms with Acetaminophen. Some of the severe cases are secondary infections (people getting infected for a second time with another serotype).The incidence of dengue has grown dramatically around the world in recent decades, with cases reported to WHO increasing from 505\u00a0430 cases in 2000 to 5.2\u00a0million in 2019 globally. A vast majority of cases are asymptomatic or mild and self-managed, and hence the actual numbers of dengue cases are under-reported. Many cases are also misdiagnosed as other febrile illnesses.The disease is now endemic in more than 100 countries in the WHO Regions of Africa, the Americas, the Eastern Mediterranean, South-East Asia and the Western Pacific. The Americas, South-East Asia and Western Pacific regions are the most seriously affected, with Asia representing around 70% of the global disease burden.The largest number of dengue cases ever reported globally was in 2019. All regions were affected, and dengue transmission was recorded in Afghanistan for the first time.\u00a0The American Region reported 3.1\u00a0million cases, with more than 25\u00a0000 classified as severe. A high number of cases were reported in Bangladesh (101\u00a0000), Malaysia (131\u00a0000) Philippines (420\u00a0000), and Vietnam (320\u00a0000).",
        "Public Health Response": "Ministry of Health (MoH) response:Regular meetings with national and subnational health authorities. Some countries have implemented Emergency Center Operations (EOC) for a suitable outbreak response.Strengthened surveillance activities for early detection of cases.Strengthened vector-control activities in affected areas.Strengthening of the laboratory network.Trained healthcare professionals in the detection of warning signals of severe dengue.Facilitated awareness raising among health workers (by sharing factsheets and surveillance tools) and to the local population using risk communication messages.\u00a0Some countries have national networks of clinical experts in arboviral diseases under the direction of the Ministries of Health in each country, which are responsible for conducting clinical training at the local level.WHO response:As part of the implementation of the Integrated Management Strategy for the Prevention and Control of Arboviral Diseases (IMS-Arbovirus), WHO is actively working with the Member States so that they can strengthen healthcare and surveillance capacity.WHO has been supporting Member States in preparedness and response to possible outbreaks, including the organization of health services.WHO is supporting the implementation of effective integrated vector surveillance and control by Member States through publishing guidelines and the provision of epidemiological surveillance materials and technical assistance to national authorities. \u00a0\u00a0WHO is supporting the increase of laboratory-capacity to enable timely and accurate diagnosis and case detection throughout the region.WHO is supporting health care workers capacity building through case management recommendations and clinical care training.WHO experts are being deployed to countries that are experiencing high-magnitude outbreaks.\u00a0In 2020, WHO began a collaboration with the Andean Health Organization-Hip\u00f3lito Unanue Agreement (ORAS-CONHU) to strengthen national technical capacities for the prevention and control of arboviral diseases in Bolivia, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela. This collaboration falls under the framework of the Integrated Management Strategy for the Prevention and Control of Arboviral Diseases, approved by WHO.Virtual cooperation spaces (VCS) have been created as an effort of collaborative surveillance between WHO and the Member States that allow the automated generation of different epidemiological analyses, situation rooms, and epidemiological bulletins, strengthening the epidemiological surveillance of dengue and other arboviruses.WHO also provides advice on risk assessment and risk communication.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Dengue is a mosquito - borne viral disease (arbovirus) that has the potential to cause serious public health impact. The virus that causes this infection has been circulating in the region of the Americas for decades10\u00a0due to the widespread distribution of the\u00a0Aedes\u00a0spp. mosquitoes (mainly\u00a0Aedes aegypti), with epidemics occurring cyclically every 3 to 5 years. Several dengue outbreaks have been documented previously in the Region. This arbovirus can be carried by infected travellers (imported cases) and may establish new areas of local transmission in the presence of vectors and a susceptible population. As they are arboviruses, all populations living in areas with the presence of\u00a0Aedes aegypti\u00a0are at risk, however, their impact largely affects the most vulnerable people, in which the arboviral disease programs do not have enough resources to respond to outbreaks.The consequences of the current high transmission scenario depend on several factors, including the current capacities for a coordinated public health response and clinical management, the early start of the arbovirus season in the southern hemisphere, high mosquito densities and the possible impact of climate change and El Nino phenomenon in the southern hemisphere, lack of vector surveillance and control activities during the COVID-19 pandemic and high proportion of the susceptible population for arboviruses in the region. The current high transmission scenario for dengue occurs in the context of other ongoing outbreaks and emergencies. The synergic effects of concurrent emergencies may hinder the health system\u2019s capacity to respond to an epidemic of arboviral diseases and therefore affect disease control and proper clinical management, including, but not limited to (i) misdiagnosis, given that \u00a0dengue symptoms may be non-specific and resemble other infections, including chikungunya, Zika and measles, potentially leading to inadequate case management;\u00a0 (ii) overwhelmed healthcare facilities in some areas given high caseload, as well as other concurrent outbreaks of other communicable diseases; and (iii) the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the decrease of available resources to arboviral disease programs and the need for capacity building and training of vector-control and healthcare workers, as well as maintenance and procurement of equipment and insecticides to perform vector control activities.Dengue is endemic in most countries of South America. However, during the seasonal period in the first half of 2023, where dengue outbreaks have been detected, there has been an increase in the number of cases at levels above the average number of cases recorded in the last five years and the expansion of dengue out of historical areas of transmission.Aedes\u00a0spp. mosquitoes are widely distributed in the Region of the Americas, therefore, dengue international spread is likely. Additionally, it is expected that in the second half of 2023, some countries in the Region, especially in Central America and the Caribbean, will have an increase in rainfall, which, depending on its magnitude and impact on dengue-endemic areas, could increase the incidence of the disease and constitute an additional burden of arboviral diseases for health systems in affected areas.The risk at the regional level is assessed as high due to the widely spread distribution of the vector (especially\u00a0Aedes aegypti), the continued risk of severe disease and even death, and the expansion out of historical areas of transmission, where all the population, including risk groups and healthcare workers, may not be aware of warning signs.Information on the circulating dengue virus serotype is limited. It is expected that a large proportion of the population in these areas is na\u00efve to the current virus circulating, which may lead to outbreaks. Moreover, people in these areas may not be aware of warning signs, and the population might delay seeking health care.In some areas, there is a lack of medical facilities with limited geographical access, making it difficult for people to access basic health care. Especially in these areas, people tend to self-medicate, and in dengue cases ibuprofen, acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are contraindicated because they can aggravate gastritis or bleeding and lead to increased mortality risk. \u00a0Other challenges reported by Member States in the Region include but are not limited to stockouts of several essential supplies for prevention and control, lack of reagents and consumables for laboratory diagnosis, and the need for re-training field teams and health workers. In addition, higher transmission rates are expected in the following months due to favourable weather conditions to vector activity in the second half of the year in Central America and the northern hemisphere.",
        "WHO Advice": "Dengue is caused by the dengue virus (DENV), an RNA virus of the family\u00a0Flaviviridae. There are four distinct but closely related serotypes of the virus (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4) - recovery from infection provides lifelong immunity against that serotype. Although most cases of dengue are mild, the sequential infection by more than one serotype increases the risk of developing severe dengue, which includes shock or respiratory distress due to plasma leakage, severe bleeding, organ impairment, and death.Prevention efforts are highly focused on the surveillance and control of\u00a0Aedes\u00a0spp. mosquitoes (the most competent vector in the region). Since vector surveillance and control may be difficult to sustain, especially in areas where DENV is endemic year-round, early detection of severe disease progression and access to proper medical attention is key to lowering severe case rates and, therefore, case fatality rates. Personal protection and source reduction measures should be maintained by communities both at places of work or study and at homes. No specific antiviral treatment exists for chikungunya and dengue. Clinical management is based on supportive care, including fluids and antipyretics; recovery can provide\u00a0\u00a0 immunity (for that specific serotype in dengue cases). As symptoms of these arboviruses may overlap, clinical-epidemiological diagnostic may be challenging, and there is cross-reactivity of the immunoglobulin M and G antibodies (IgM and IgG) of dengue and Zika viruses, hindering accurate diagnosis, which can lead to inadequate case management, and compromising efficient epidemiological surveillance. The reason why molecular diagnosis with RT-PCR is recommended.It is very important that the Member States in the Americas are extremely vigilant and prepared to intensify actions to prevent, early detect, diagnose, and control arboviruses, including training and alerting healthcare workers on the detection of cases and potential complications of these diseases, identification of risk groups for severe disease, appropriate clinical management and follow up of cases to prevent future deaths. \u00a0In the second half of 2023, an increase in dengue cases is expected. Targeted integrated vector surveillance, monitoring insecticide resistance in dengue vector and control measures are helpful in reducing transmission rates. As a general precaution, WHO recommends avoidance of mosquito bites, including the use of repellents. The highest risk for transmission of dengue is during the day and early evening.WHO reiterates to all Member States the importance of strengthening: 1) their laboratory capacity to recognize and confirm the cases timely; 2) their healthcare capacity to rapidly detect and manage cases, and 3) their surveillance capacity to rapidly detect trends on the incidence and implement control measures. It is relevant to maintain close monitoring of the situation in the region with active cross-border coordination and information sharing because of the possibility of cases in neighbouring countries.WHO does not recommend any travel and/or trade restrictions for countries in the Americas experiencing the current dengue epidemics based on the currently available information.",

        "Location": "Poland",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 27 June 2023, the IHR National Focal Point of Poland notified WHO of unusual deaths in cats across the country. As of 11 July, 47 samples have been tested from 46 cats and one captive caracal, of which 29 were found to be positive for influenza A (H5N1). Fourteen cats are reported to have been euthanized, and a further 11 died, with the last death reported on 30 June. The source of the exposure of cats to the virus is currently unknown and epizootic investigations are ongoing.\nSporadic infection of cats with A(H5N1) has previously been reported, but this is the first report of a high numbers of infected cats over a wide geographical area within a country.\nAs of 12 July, no human contacts of A(H5N1) positive cats have reported symptoms, and the surveillance period for all contacts is now complete.\nThe risk of human infections following exposure to infected cats at the national level is assessed as low for the general population, and low to moderate for cat owners and those occupationally exposed to H5N1-infected cats (such as veterinarians) without the use of appropriate personal protective equipment.\nWHO continues to monitor the situation and work in close collaboration with the animal and public health sectors, regional agencies, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH), and other partner agencies in Poland.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 27 June 2023, the IHR National Focal Point of Poland notified WHO of unusual deaths in cats across the country. As of 11 July 2023, a total of 47 samples have been tested from 46 cats and one caracal (Caracal caracal). Of these 47 samples, 29 (62%) were positive for influenza A(H5N1). Positive samples were reported from 13 geographical areas within the country. Some cats developed severe symptoms including difficulty in breathing, bloody diarrhoea, and neurological signs, with rapid deterioration and death in some cases. In total, 20 cats had neurological signs, 19 had respiratory signs, and 17 had both neurological and respiratory signs.\u00a0 Fourteen cats are reported to have been euthanized, and a further 11 died.\u00a0 Post-mortem exams on a small number of cats are suggestive of pneumonia. According to the information available, the last known death among cats was reported on 30 June .Genomic analysis of 19 viruses sequenced from this outbreak showed that they all belonged to the H5 clade 2.3.4.4b and were highly related to each other. Also, the viruses are similar to influenza A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b viruses which have been circulating in wild birds and which caused outbreaks in poultry recently in Poland.\u00a0 The source of exposure of cats to the virus is currently unknown and epizootic investigations are ongoing. There are several possibilities for the source of infection, among which the cats could have had direct or indirect contact with infected birds or their environments, ate infected birds, or ate food contaminated with the virus. Authorities are investigating all potential sources and to date have not ruled out any. Of the 25 cats for which the information is available, two were outdoor cats, 18 were indoor with access to a balcony, terrace, or backyard, and five were indoor cats with no access to the outside environment. Seven cats are reported to have had the opportunity for contact with wild birds.\u00a0 This is the first report of high numbers of cats infected with avian influenza A(H5N1) spread over a wide geographical area within any country.\u00a0 Sporadic infections in domestic cats with A(H5N1) viruses, including A(H5N1) H5 clade 2.3.4.4b viruses, have been reported previously, following close contact of the cats with infected birds or from ingesting meat of infected birds.",
        "Epidemiology": "Since the end of 2021, an unprecedented number of H5N1 outbreaks among poultry and wild birds has been reported worldwide. As of June 2023, the clade 2.3.4.4b viruses have become dominant in Asia, Europe, the Americas and Africa. Alongside wild bird and domestic poultry infections, there have been increased detections in non-avian species, including wild terrestrial (often scavenging) and marine mammals and occasionally in farmed or captive mammalian species, likely through contact with infected live or dead birds or their environments.\u00a0Since 2020, 12 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b virus detections have been reported to WHO, four of which were severe cases and eight were mild or asymptomatic. It is unclear if the detection of the virus in these mild or asymptomatic cases resulted from infection or temporary contamination of the nasal passages. Most humans infected with A(H5N1) viruses have resulted from direct or indirect contact with infected live or dead poultry. Human infection with influenza A(H5N1) viruses can cause severe disease and is fatal in some cases.",
        "Public Health Response": "Response measures have been implemented by the national authorities in Poland. These include:Under the guidance of the public health authorities in Poland, all owners of infected cats are provided with a health self-assessment questionnaire and requested to self-monitor for symptoms of influenza-like illness (ILI) or acute respiratory illness (ARI) for 10 days since last contact with infected cat. As of 12 July, 70 individuals who had been in contact with confirmed cats have completed self-monitoring and none reported symptoms. \u00a0\u00a0Providing regular updates on the situation and sharing information and updates with partners, including international organizations. Epizootic investigations are underway to understand the epidemiological situation in cats and the likely source of exposure of cats to the virus. Preventive measures have been taken to prevent the occurrence of disease in humans by issuing publicly available general precautions for cat owners and individuals who have contact with sick animals suspected of avian influenza infection.\u00a0WHO continues to monitor the situation and work in close collaboration with the animal and public health sectors, regional agencies, FAO, WOAH, and other partner agencies in Poland and globally.WHO is evaluating the existing candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs) of A(H5N1) through the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) to ensure valid CVVs are developed and available for pandemic preparedness purposes.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "To date, human A(H5N1) infections following contact with an infected cat have not been documented. Avian Influenza A(H5N1) virus detections in humans remain unusual, and sustained human-to-human transmission has not been documented. To date, no symptomatic human contact of infected cats has been reported in Poland despite potentially close contact between cats and owners, \u00a0and the capacity to detect a human case in contact with an infected cat is adequate in the country.\u00a0  Therefore, based on current information, the risk of human infections following exposure to infected cats at the national level is assessed as low for the general population, and low to moderate for cat owners and those occupationally exposed to A(H5N1)-infected cats (such as veterinarians) without the use of appropriate personal protective equipment. Based on the current information, the risk for humans at the regional level is assessed as low, due to: i) avian influenza surveillance activities in animals in Europe being strengthened since September 2022, when the unprecedented geographical extent (37 European countries affected) resulted in 50 million poultry being culled in affected establishments; and (ii) Currently, there are no reported instances of human infection with the A(H5N1) virus acquired from cats, although A(H5N1) infection in domestic cats has been confirmed in Poland.  Due to the uncertainties related to this event, including the source of infection, the risk assessment may change.",
        "WHO Advice": "The reports of these events do not change the current WHO recommendations on public health measures and surveillance of influenza.Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect and monitor virological, epidemiological and clinical changes associated with emerging or circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health and timely virus-sharing for risk assessment.All individuals exposed to animal influenza viruses, and all contacts of confirmed human cases, should monitor their health for the duration of the known exposure period with additional seven days at a minimum. All those exposed to known infected poultry, wild birds or other animals, or to farms under suspicion, should be registered and placed under close monitoring by local health authorities. This will facilitate the early detection of illness and timely clinical case management. If a person is suspected of having zoonotic influenza, the health authorities must be notified, and appropriate clinical case management should be provided.Public health and animal health authorities should collaborate closely in the areas of information sharing, joint risk assessment, and response to outbreaks of zoonotic influenza at the human-animal interface, adhering to the One Health approach.FAO, WHO and WOAH have issued a joint situation analysis and advice to countries in relation to ongoing avian influenza outbreaks in animals and the risk posed to human health.\u00a0 FAO, WHO and WOAH continue to review the situation, monitoring the rapidly evolving nature of the virus, and updating recommendations for curbing its spread, in addition to working with countries in preparedness and response, and facilitating collaboration across countries and sectors. The spread of the virus to five continents speaks to the need for global cooperation and alertness to protect animals, people, and economies.WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel and/or trade with Poland based on available information on this event.",

        "Date Reported": "16 June 2023",
        "Location": "Brazil",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 7 June 2023, Brazil notified the World Health Organization (WHO) of a fatal laboratory-confirmed human case of infection with a swine-origin influenza A(H1N1) variant (v) virus in the inner state of Paran\u00e1.\nSporadic human cases of influenza A(H1N1)v have been reported previously, including from Brazil. According to the International Health Regulations (IHR) 2005, a human infection caused by a novel influenza A virus subtype is an event that has the potential for high public health impact and must be notified to the WHO.\nBased on the information currently available, WHO considers this a sporadic case, and there is no evidence of person-to-person transmission of this event. The likelihood of community-level spread among humans and/or international disease spread through humans is low.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 7 June 2023, the Brazil IHR National Focal Point (NFP) notified WHO of a fatal human infection caused by a swine-origin influenza A(H1N1)v virus detected by the National Influenza Centre (NIC), Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro.The patient was a 42-year-old woman with underlying medical conditions who lived near a swine farm. She developed fever, headache, sore throat, and abdominal pain on 1 May 2023 and was hospitalized on 3 May with a severe acute respiratory infection. On 4 May, the patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and she passed away on 5 May.Ongoing investigations reported that the patient did not have any direct contact with pigs, however, two of her close contacts worked at the swine farm. The two contacts did not develop respiratory disease and tested negative for influenza. To date, no human-to-human transmission associated with this case has been identified.\u00a0During hospitalization, a nasopharyngeal swab sample was collected from the patient for influenza and SARS-CoV-2 testing, as part of regular respiratory virus surveillance activities. Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) was conducted at the State of Paran\u00e1 Central Public Health Laboratory, where the sample was subtyped as an influenza A/H1 virus. The sample also tested positive for a swine influenza A virus marker by RT-PCR.\u00a0The specimen was forwarded to the National Influenza Centre Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, in Rio de Janeiro, where further complementary analyses and genomic sequencing were performed. Samples received at the NIC on 25 May were confirmed to be an influenza A(H1N1)v virus by sequence analysis on 30 May. The recovered genome has a high identity (99%) with the haemagglutinin (HA) of other Influenza A(H1N1)v viruses previously detected in the municipality of Toledo state of Paran\u00e1 in 2022. In addition, it has 96% identity with the HA of viruses collected from pigs in Brazil in 2015.On 8 June, after the Brazilian Ministry of Health (MoH) notified WHO under the IHR, the NIC started the process to send the patient's samples to the WHO Collaborating Centre at the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC) for further characterization.",
        "Epidemiology": "Influenza A(H1) viruses are enzootic in swine populations in most regions of the world. When an influenza virus that normally circulates in swine is detected in a person, it is called a \u201cvariant influenza virus\u201d. H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2 are major subtypes of swine influenza A viruses in pigs and occasionally infect humans, usually after direct or indirect exposure to pigs or contaminated environments.Human infections with variant viruses tend to result in mild clinical illness, although some cases have been hospitalized with more severe disease and some have been fatal.To date, sporadic human infections caused by influenza A(H1N1)v and A(H1N2)v viruses have been reported in Brazil, and there has been no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission.This is the first human infection caused by an influenza A(H1N1)v virus reported in 2023 in Brazil, and the third human infection reported in the state of Parana (the first was detected in 2021 and the second in 2022).",
        "Public Health Response": "Local and national health authorities implemented the following public health measures:Conducting further epidemiological investigations, and follow-up of contacts in the family, community, and health care facilities.Monitoring the surveillance of influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) in the surrounding municipalities (within the same health region), particularly influenza virus, seeking to analyze the behavior and trends of respiratory viruses in the region.Reinforcing the vaccination campaign for seasonal influenza in at-risk groups.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "This is a sporadic case based on currently available information and further spread has not been detected.Limited, non-sustained human-to-human transmission of variant influenza viruses has been described, although ongoing community transmission has not been identified. Current evidence suggests that these viruses have not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans.There is no vaccine for Influenza A(H1N1)v infection currently licensed for use in humans. Seasonal influenza vaccines against human influenza viruses are generally not expected to protect people from influenza viruses that normally circulate in pigs, but they can reduce the likelihood of getting sick with both human and variant influenza viruses.WHO assesses the risk of international disease spread through humans and/or community-level spread among humans posed by this event as low. The risk level will be amended if warranted by the investigations currently being conducted by national authorities.",
        "WHO Advice": "Surveillance:This case does not change the current WHO recommendations on public health measures and surveillance of seasonal influenza.Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect virological, epidemiological and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health and timely virus sharing for risk assessment.Continued vigilance is needed within affected and neighboring areas to detect infections in animals and humans. Collaboration between the animal and human health sectors is essential. As the extent of influenza viruses circulating in animals is unclear, epidemiologic and virologic surveillance and the follow-up of suspected human cases should continue systematically. Guidance on the investigation of non-seasonal influenza and other emerging acute respiratory diseases is available on the WHO website.Vigilance for the emergence of novel influenza viruses of pandemic potential should be maintained. WHO has developed practical guidance for integrated surveillance in the context of the cocirculation of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses.It is critical that influenza viruses from animals or from people are fully characterized in appropriate animal or human health influenza reference laboratories. Under WHO\u2019s Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework, Member States are expected to share influenza viruses with pandemic potential on a regular and timely basis with the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS).Notification and investigation:All human infections caused by a novel influenza subtype are notifiable under the IHR, and State Parties to the IHR are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic. Evidence of illness is not required for this report.In the case of a confirmed or suspected human infection caused by a novel influenza virus with pandemic potential, including a variant virus, a thorough epidemiologic investigation of history of exposure to animals, of travel, and contact tracing should be conducted. The epidemiologic investigation should include early identification of unusual respiratory events that could indicate person-to-person transmission of the novel virus. Clinical samples collected from the time and place that the case occurred should be tested and sent to a WHO Collaboration Centre for further characterization.Travel and trade:WHO does not recommend any travel and/or trade restrictions for Brazil based on available information on this event.Prevention measures for travelers: WHO advises that travelers to countries with known outbreaks of animal influenza should avoid farms, contact with animals in live animal markets, entering areas where animals may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with animal excreta. Travelers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. All individuals should follow good food safety and hygiene practices.WHO does not advise special traveler screening at points of entry or restrictions with regard to the current situation of influenza viruses at the human-animal interface.",

        "Outbreak name": "Marburg virus disease",
        "Date Reported": "9 June 2023",
        "Location": "Equatorial Guinea",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 8 June 2023, after two consecutive incubation periods (42 days) without a new confirmed case reported, the Ministry of Health of Equatorial Guinea declared the end of the Marburg virus disease (MVD) outbreak, as per the WHO recommendations. A total of 17 confirmed and 23 probable cases were reported from five districts in four provinces; 12 of the 17 confirmed cases died and all of the probable cases were reported deaths.\nWHO and partners provided technical support to the government to contain this outbreak through its country office.\nWHO encourages maintaining most response activities for three months after the outbreak ends. This is to make sure that if the disease re-emerges, health authorities are able to detect it immediately, prevent the disease from spreading again, and ultimately save lives.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 13 February 2023, the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare of Equatorial Guinea declared an outbreak of MVD after suspected viral hemorrhagic fever deaths were reported between 7 January and 7 February 2023, and a case tested positive on 12 February for Marburg virus by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at the Institut Pasteur de Dakar in Senegal.From the outbreak declaration until 7 June 2023, 17 confirmed and 23 probable cases were reported in the continental region of Equatorial Guinea. Twelve of the confirmed cases died and all of the probable cases were reported deaths (the case fatality ratio among confirmed cases is 75%, excluding one confirmed case with an unknown outcome).The last confirmed case admitted to a Marburg treatment center in Bata district in Litoral province was discharged on 26 April, after two consecutive negative PCR tests for MVD. On 8 June 2023, after two consecutive incubation periods (42 days) without a new confirmed case reported, the Ministry of Health of Equatorial Guinea declared the end of the outbreak.Confirmed or probable cases were reported in five districts (Bata, Ebebiyin, Evinayong, Nsok Nsomo and Nsork) in four of the country\u2019s eight provinces (Centro Sur, Ki\u00e9-Ntem, Litoral and Wele-Nzas).Five cases (31%) were identified among healthcare workers, of whom two died (CFR among HCWs: 40%).Four patients recovered and were enrolled in a survivor care programme to receive psychosocial and other post-recovery support.Figure 1. MVD cases by week of symptoms onset* and case classification, Equatorial Guinea, as of 7 June 2023.Figure 2. Map of districts reporting MVD confirmed and probable cases during the outbreak, Equatorial Guinea.",
        "Epidemiology": "Marburg virus spreads between people via direct contact through broken skin or mucous membranes with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people, and with surfaces and materials such as bedding, and clothing contaminated with these fluids. Healthcare workers have previously been infected while treating suspected or confirmed MVD patients. Burial ceremonies that involve direct contact with the body of the deceased can also contribute to the transmission of Marburg virus.The incubation period varies from two to 21 days. Illness caused by Marburg virus begins abruptly, with high fever, severe headache, and severe malaise. Severe haemorrhagic manifestations may appear between five and seven days from symptom onset, although not all cases have haemorrhagic signs, and fatal cases usually have some form of bleeding, often from multiple areas.Although no vaccines or antiviral treatments are approved to treat the virus, Remdesivir was used in this outbreak on compassionate care basis. Supportive care \u2013 rehydration with oral or intravenous fluids \u2013 and treatment of specific symptoms improve survival. A range of potential treatments are being evaluated, including blood products, immune therapies, and drug therapies.This was the first documented outbreak of MVD reported in Equatorial Guinea. Another MVD outbreak was recently declared over in the United Republic of Tanzania (for more information, see the\u00a0Disease Outbreak News published on 2 June 2023). MVD outbreaks have been previously reported in Ghana (2022), Guinea (2021), Uganda (2017, 2014, 2012, 2007), Angola (2004-2005), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (1998 and 2000), Kenya (1990, 1987, 1980) and South Africa (1975).",
        "Public Health Response": "Coordination Following the official outbreak declaration in the country, the Government of Equatorial Guinea established an emergency response structure to manage the response in the continental region with supporting partners and developed an initial three-month operational response plan.A transition and recovery plan for a one-year period has been developed. This plan will be implemented under leadership from the Ministry of Health, with support from partners, including WHO.Partners from the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) were mobilized to assist in response activities. Several experts have been deployed through WHO to support case management, laboratory, epidemiology, and surveillance functions.WHO supported the Ministry of Health in providing training for surveillance activities, including case investigation, contact tracing, active case search in health facilities and the community, and in supervising field teams.The UN system, including WHO, continues to advocate for the Prevention of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse as it awaits government agreement to undertake community-based activities.Partner SupportSeveral partners supported the government-led response through the provision of technical, financial and operational support. These include WHO, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US-CDC), the Cuban Medical Brigade, the Africa Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), and the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF).SurveillanceWHO supported the establishment of the alert and dispatch center for MVD alert management.WHO provided training and supportive supervision of surveillance activities, including case investigation and contact tracing and coordinating with healthcare facilities for active surveillance.Laboratory With the support of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and WHO, laboratories with RT-PCR capacities were set up initially in Ebebiyin and then in Bata.MVD diagnostic and sequencing capacities were subsequently implemented in Malabo at the Baney laboratory with support from Institut Pasteur Dakar and WHO, as well as other partners.WHO continues to support laboratory operations as well as specimen transportation notably through the training of shippers of infectious substances.Clinical careWHO supported the MoH in the establishment of the Mondong Treatment Center in Bata and in the coordination of a referral system, including three ambulances that can retrieve suspected and confirmed patients from any district in the region and bring them to the Mondong treatment center.WHO also supported the MoH in the establishment of a survivor clinic that provides medical and psychological care and testing to survivors.Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) and WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene)WHO supported the establishment of the MoH regional IPC task force for coordination of IPC activities which met daily.In collaboration with MOH and US CDC, WHO supported the development and implementation of the National Strategy for the IPC response which was endorsed by MOH and implemented by key partners including UNICEF and Africa CDC.WHO developed IPC technical guidance and other products including Standard Operating Procedures, checklists, training materials and tools as needed.WHO supported the MoH in developing a rapid health care facility evaluation tool on IPC measures in place (such as screening and isolation capacity), including making this tool available online.WHO provided IPC training modules in the context of MVD, which were adopted and used to train health workers in all the affected districts as well as adopted by key implementing partners.WHO operational support and logistics (OSL) and UNICEF identified key IPC supplies required (including personal protective equipment, alcohol-based hand rub, etc).WHO worked with partners to advocate for improved Water, Sanitation and Hygiene in health facilities, in particular water supply and waste management.WHO supported the establishment, training and implementation of decontamination and safe and dignified burial teams.WHO recruited and trained five national IPC focal points in Bata, Ebibeyin, Mongomo, Evinayong and Malabo.Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE) WHO supported MoH in the development of an RCCE national plan and establish an RCCE coordination with key partners (UNICEF, IFRC, Africa CDC, among others) to ensure timely, relevant and actionable RCCE messaging, and activities reach affected and at-risk populations.Intensive and tailored public awareness, strategic networking, and capacity building for RCCE national experts, social mobilizers, and community leaders were implemented in all the affected districts.\u00a0 Religious leaders, decision-makers, school delegates, volunteers, media professionals, etc. were engaged to enhance community involvement in the response.Border health and points of entryOn 26 April 2023, WHO organized a webinar with the support of the US-CDC and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) to raise awareness on the necessary border health readiness and response activities in the context of MVD outbreaks for affected and neighboring countries.Operational support and logistics (OSL)\u200bWHO has provided operational and logistics support and maintenance of the Marburg treatment centre, including structural rehabilitation, provision of electricity and water, and supply chain management.WHO established support for fleet management, including three ambulances on standby 24/7 at the Bata treatment centr\u200be, and approximately 20 vehicles.WHO has provided essential medicines and supplies to all pillars.WHO established a central warehouse for essential items in Bata, which supports distribution to other areas. Readiness and preparedness in neighboring countries  Readiness activities were scaled up in the neighbouring countries of Cameroon and Gabon to detect as early as possible any suspected case. All alerts from these neighbouring countries were investigated to rule out MVD. WHO developed a readiness checklist to assist neighbouring countries in assessing their level of readiness, and identifying potential gaps and concrete actions to be taken in case of any potential outbreak of filovirus including MVD. The checklist consists of several key components and an average score is calculated to provide readiness scores to each of the identified countries. A second round of readiness assessment across all pillars was conducted for Cameroon and Gabon. Based on the gaps identified during the assessments, a gap analysis was conducted and shared with Cameroon and Gabon to inform priority readiness activities. The identified gaps were addressed through the optimization of operational capacities and capabilities using various strategies, including trainings, table-top exercises, and simulation exercises. Additionally, experts were deployed to support the implementation of the readiness activities.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "In compliance with WHO recommendations, the criteria to declare the end of an outbreak after two maximum incubation periods (42 days) was observed with no new confirmed or probable case of MVD detected.Based on knowledge of past outbreaks of filovirus disease, there remains a risk of re-emergence of MVD even following the declaration of the end of the outbreak. Undetected transmission of Marburg virus may exist in the country; not all chains of transmission were definitively linked, and one confirmed case was never identified. The initial source of the outbreak has not been identified, and a new emergence of disease is possible, including from interaction with animal reservoirs. The virus may also persist for an extended period in body fluids of survivors, including semen, underlying the importance of their participation in the survivors program, and the support the program provides.Based on the available information at the end of MVD outbreak in Equatorial Guinea, the risk of MVD remerging is considered as low\u00a0at the national level, low at the subregional level, regional level and at the global level.",
        "WHO Advice": "The current WHO recommendation is that most response activities continue for three months after the outbreak ends, to make sure that if the disease re-emerges, health authorities can detect it right away, prevent the disease from spreading, and ultimately save lives.WHO advises the following risk reduction measures as an effective way to reduce MVD transmission:Reducing the risk of bat-to-human transmission arising from prolonged exposure to mines or caves inhabited by fruit bat colonies. During work or research activities or tourist visits in mines or caves inhabited by fruit bat colonies, people should wear gloves and other appropriate protective clothing (including masks). During outbreaks, all animal products (blood and meat) should be thoroughly cooked before consumption.Health facilities should ensure IPC measure programs are in place including screening for cases of MVD, training of health workers on IPC practices, safe injection practices, environmental cleaning and disinfection protocols are in place, decontamination of reusable medical devices and safe waste management.\u00a0Health workers caring for patients with confirmed or suspected MVD should apply transmission-based precautions in addition to standard precautions, including appropriate use of personal protective equipment and hand hygiene according to the\u00a0WHO 5 moments\u00a0to avoid contact with patients' blood and other body fluids and with contaminated surfaces and objects.Surveillance activities should be strengthened to ensure early detection of any future cases. Raising community awareness of the risk factors for Marburg virus infection and the protective measures individuals can take to reduce human exposure to the virus is key to reducing human infections and deaths. This includes reminders for persons with symptoms to immediately seek care in health facilities to reduce the risk of transmission in the community and to receive treatment, thereby improving chances for recovery. Community and family members should avoid caring for symptomatic individuals at home, avoid touching bodies of people deceased with MVD symptoms, other potentially contaminated items, and surfaces, and encourage them to go to a health facility for assessment and treatment.WHO advises against applying international travel and/or trade measures to Equatorial Guinea.",

        "Description of the Situation": "On 21 March 2023, the Ministry of Health (MoH) of the United Republic of Tanzania officially declared the first MVD outbreak in the country. Between 21 March and 31 May, a total of nine cases, including eight laboratory-confirmed cases and one probable (the index case), were reported (Figure 1). The last confirmed case was reported on 11 April 2023 and the date of sample collection of the second negative PCR test was on 19 April 2023. All cases were reported from Bukoba district, Kagera region, in the north of the country.Among the confirmed cases, three have recovered, and a total of six deaths (CFR 67%) have been reported, of which five were confirmed and one was a probable case. Cases ranged in age from 1 to 59 years old (median 35 years old), with males being the most affected (n= 6; 67%). Six cases were close relatives of the index case, and two were healthcare workers who provided medical care to the patients.On 2 June 2023, the MoH of the United Republic of Tanzania declared the end of the MVD outbreak. This declaration was made 42 days (twice the maximum incubation period for Marburg virus infection) after the last possible exposure to MVD probable or confirmed case.

        "Public Health Response": "The MoH, together with WHO and other partners, initiated response measures to control the outbreak and prevent further spread to other regions in the country and neighboring countries. Regular coordination meetings were held to coordinate responses.Active case search and alert management were implemented, with a total of 243 alerts received as of 30 May, of which 62 MVD suspected cases were detected, and samples were sent for laboratory confirmation. The eight laboratory-confirmed cases were identified, and the remaining samples tested negative. A total of 212 contacts were identified and monitored with 210 having completed their 21-day follow-up period with no symptoms. Of the remaining two contacts, one developed symptoms and subsequently tested positive for MVD while the other died due to other causes.The three recovered cases were provided with care and, together with their relatives, received mental health and psychosocial support services (MHPSS) through the survivor programme.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "On 2 June 2023, the Ministry of Health of the United Republic of Tanzania declared the end of the MVD outbreak that affected Bukoba district in Kagera region.\u00a0 This was the first documented MVD outbreak in the country.MVD is an epidemic-prone disease associated with high case fatality ratios (CFR 24-90%). MVD is caused by the same family (Filoviridae) as Ebola virus disease (EVD) and is clinically similar. In the early course of the disease, clinical diagnosis of MVD is difficult to distinguish from other tropical febrile illnesses because of the similarities in the clinical symptoms. Other viral hemorrhagic fevers need to be excluded, particularly Ebola diseases, as well as malaria, typhoid fever, and dengue. Epidemiologic features can help differentiate between diseases (i.e., exposure to bats, caves, or mining).Marburg virus has been isolated from fruit bats (Roussettus aegyptiacus) that are present in the United Republic of Tanzania and countries neighboring the affected Kagera region, therefore the same bat species may carry the virus in this region.Based on the available information at the end of MVD outbreak in the United Republic of Tanzania, the risk is considered as low\u00a0at national level, low at the subregional level, regional level and at the global level.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO encourages countries to maintain most response activities for three months after the outbreak is declared over.

        "Outbreak name": "Outbreak of suspected fungal meningitis associated with surgical procedures performed under spinal anaesthesia",
        "Date Reported": "1 June 2023",
        "Location": "the United States of America and Mexico",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 11 May 2023, the United States of America Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC) notified the Mexico General Directorate of Epidemiology (DGE) of five cases with central nervous system infection (CNSI) in the United States of America. All five cases were females with a history of undergoing surgical procedures performed under spinal anaesthesia in Mexico. The surgeries were performed in two private clinics, located in the city of Matamoros, Tamaulipas state, on the border with the USA.\nLaboratory test results from samples collected from patients in the USA and Mexico were consistent with meningitis caused by pathogenic fungi.\nFungal meningitis is rare but can be fatal and requires immediate medical care.\nWHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation based on the latest available information.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 11 May 2023, the US CDC notified the Mexico\u2019s DGE through the International Health Regulations National Focal Point (IHR NFP),\u00a0 the identification of five female cases with CNSI in the USA, with a history of undergoing surgical procedures performed under spinal anaesthesia in two private clinics in a city in Mexico, bordering the USA. As of 26 May 2023, the health authorities from Mexico and the USA have reported a total of 20 cases presenting with signs and symptoms compatible with CNSI, including two deaths reported by the US CDC. Patients presented to the hospital with symptoms including headache, fever, nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light, and fainting after receiving surgical procedures in two private clinics located in the city of Matamoros, Tamaulipas state in Mexico, on the border with the USA between January and April 2023.The Mexico Epidemiological Diagnosis and Reference Institute (InDRE per its acronym in Spanish) has received five samples of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that tested positive for a fungus, Fusarium solani by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Additionally, according to the health authorities from the USA, the laboratory results from nine suspected cases were consistent with meningitis, of which two CSF and two blood samples showed elevated levels of (1,3)-beta-D-glucan, a biomarker for fungal infection. \u00a0Two pan-fungal PCR tests were negative.According to the investigation performed, a total of 547 people had these procedures\u00a0 between January and April 2023 in the concerned two private clinics, of whom 304 (56%) reside in Mexico, 237 (43%) in the United States, and one in Canada.",
        "Epidemiology": "Several species of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites can cause meningitis, an inflammation of the tissues surrounding the brain and spinal cord. Fungal meningitis can develop after a\u00a0fungal infection spread from somewhere else in the body to the central nervous system. It can be fatal and requires immediate medical care. \u00a0While rare, medical and surgical procedures can lead to fungal meningitis if medical devices or medications are contaminated with fungi, or if proper infection prevention control practices are not taken. This type of healthcare-associated infection can lead to severe illness or death. Healthcare-associated fungal meningitis outbreaks have occurred among patients who received spinal anesthesia.",
        "Public Health Response": "The United States of America and Mexico Health Authorities are investigating additional cases that may be associated with this outbreak in both countries. The response measures include: In the United States of America:On 8 May 2023, through the Emerging Infections Network , US CDC learned of two unusual meningitis cases in Texas with prior spinal anesthesia. On 16 May, the US CDC published a level 2 travel health notice related to fungal infections following procedures performed under spinal anaesthesia in Mexico with recommendations for the public and clinicians.\u00a0Additionally, on 24 May, an interim recommendation for diagnosing and managing cases of suspected fungal meningitis associated with spinal anesthesia administered in Matamoros, Mexico, were also published by the US CDC.On 17 May, the US CDC published a Health Alert Network related to an outbreak of suspected fungal meningitis in patients who underwent procedures performed under spinal anesthesia in Matamoros, Mexico.\u00a0State and local health departments have initiated contacting and follow-up of people through telephone calls and home visits who are known to have had procedures performed under spinal anesthesia at these two clinics since January 2023. Instructions are given to people to go to their nearest health clinic, urgent care, or emergency room for diagnostic testing including a magnetic resonance imaging \u00a0and a lumbar puncture.In Mexico:Epidemiological investigations are ongoing in Matamoros, Mexico. In addition, the DGE is working with State Health Services and the Matamoros Health Jurisdiction on operational definitions. Mexico health authorities are strengthening active epidemiological surveillance for meningitis in Tamaulipas state to achieve timely identification.On 13 May, Tamaulipas Health Authority closed the two private healthcare facilities where these surgical procedures were performed.A follow-up of exposed people was initiated through telephone calls and home visits.On 19 May, the Mexico IHR NFP\u00a0 notified PAHO/WHO of an outbreak of CNSI associated with spinal anaesthesia\u00a0 in Matamoros, Tamaulipas state.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Fungal meningitis cases following a medical/surgical procedure are very infrequent and unusual. In 2012, the US CDC investigated a multistate outbreak of fungal meningitis and other infections among patients who received contaminated preservative-free methylprednisolone acetate\u00a0( MPA) steroid injections; 753 cases were reported, including 64 deaths in 20 States in the USA. The source, vehicle, and the transmission route for the current outbreak remains unknown, although the investigations are ongoing. A fungal infection is suspected based on preliminary information provided by the health authorities from Mexico and the USA.Each year, more than a million people from the USA participate in medical tourism. In 2017, more than 1.4 million Americans sought health care in a variety of countries around the world. These medical tourists commonly travel to Mexico, Canada, and countries in Central America, South America, and the Caribbean. At present, there is no evidence to suggest any secondary spread from these cases of health care associated fungal meningitis The involved healthcare facilities where the procedures were undertaken have been closed since 13 May. However, there is an ongoing investigation and follow up of people who may have been exposed to fungal infections. This may lead to additional cases being reported until the follow up of people exposed to such procedure is completed. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and review the risk assessment based on the latest available information.",
        "WHO Advice": "As \u00a0the outbreak's source is yet to be established, WHO Member States must stay vigilant. It is critically important for affected Member States to identify any possible cases, establish the causal chain, and determine if any substandard/falsified products or procedures could be related. Investigation of these cases will assist in rapid containment at the disease source to prevent additional suspected cases.WHO recommends the continuation of laboratory analyses, case identification and clinical care, follow-up of potentially exposed people, outbreak investigation to identify the agent, the source, the vehicle, and the transmission route, implementation of measures to prevent further infections, and enhancement of Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) measures.IPC measures in health facilities should be reinforced to prevent healthcare-associated transmission. Attention should be paid to ensure injection safety practices are adhered to, including standards being met for medical device disposal or reprocessing (if reusable). Processes used for the storage, transport, and preparation of sharps, syringes, and vials should be examined to ensure sterility prior to use in local healthcare facilities. Use of multidose vials should be avoided. IPC practices should be reviewed and reinforced in operating theaters to ensure they are adhered to, including appropriate personal protective equipment use, before aseptic procedures, including skin antisepsis for safe administration of spinal anesthesia, as well as ensuring environmental cleaning. WHO does not recommend any specific different measures for travellers visiting Mexico. In case of symptoms suggestive of meningitis during or after travel, travelers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history with their healthcare provider.WHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions on Mexico and the United States of America based on the current information available on this event.",

        "Location": "France",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 12 September 2023, local public health authorities in France identified a cluster of 10 cases with suspected botulism, including one death. As of 14 September 2023, the National IHR Focal Point for France has notified WHO of a total of 15 cases of suspected botulism, including one death, reported in Bordeaux and Ile-de-France.\nThe epidemiological investigations indicated that the source of infection is the consumption of homemade preserved sardines , on different dates, at the same restaurant in Bordeaux during the week of 4\u201310 September 2023. The food item was made at the restaurant for consumption on premises.\nDue to the incubation period of up to eight days and the restaurant attracting international visitors during the Rugby World Cup, there is a possibility that additional cases among international visitors may be reported in France, or possibly outside France as travellers returned home, until 18 September.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 12 September 2023, local public health authorities in France identified a cluster of 10 cases with suspected botulism, including one death. As of 14 September 2023, the National IHR Focal Point for France has notified a total of 15 cases of suspected botulism, including one death, reported in Bordeaux and Ile-de-France. Of these 15 cases, 10 have been hospitalised, with eight patients being admitted to an Intensive Care Unit. Fourteen out of the 15 cases are reported among foreign citizens identified from six countries in addition to France. These include Canada, Germany, Greece, Ireland, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the United States of America. All suspected cases consumed the same product (sardines in jars) on different dates at the same restaurant in Bordeaux during the week of 4\u201310 September 2023. The epidemiological investigations indicated that the source of infection is the consumption of homemade preserved sardines. The food item was produced and served at the restaurant.",
        "Epidemiology": "Botulism is a serious neurological condition\u00a0caused by a very potent toxin produced by the bacterium\u00a0\u00a0Clostridium botulinum\u00a0.\u00a0It develops particularly in poorly preserved foods. Human botulism may refer to foodborne botulism, infant botulism, wound botulism, and inhalation botulism or other types of intoxication.Foodborne botulism is a serious, potentially fatal disease. It is an intoxication caused by ingestion of potent neurotoxins\u2014the botulinum toxins\u2014formed in contaminated foods. Person-to-person transmission of botulism does not occur. The manifestations, or symptoms, of intoxication can vary, and \u00a0is characterized by descending, flaccid paralysis that can cause respiratory failure. Early symptoms include marked fatigue, weakness and vertigo, usually followed by blurred vision, dry mouth and difficulty in swallowing and speaking. Vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation and abdominal swelling may also occur. The disease can progress to weakness in the neck and arms, after which the respiratory muscles and muscles of the lower body are affected. There is no fever and no loss of consciousness. Symptoms usually appear from several hours up to 8 days following consumption of contaminated food.Although botulism outbreaks are relatively rare, they are considered public health emergencies that require rapid recognition to identify the disease source, distinguish outbreak types (between natural, accidental or deliberate), prevent additional cases and effectively administer treatment to affected patients. Successful treatment depends significantly on early diagnosis and the rapid administration of the botulinum antitoxin and intensive respiratory care.Incidence of botulism is low, but the mortality rate is high if prompt diagnosis and appropriate, immediate treatment is not given. The disease can be fatal in 5% to 10% of cases.",
        "Public Health Response": "On 11 September, food and serum samples were shipped to the French National Reference Center for Anaerobic Bacteria and Botulism, Institute Pasteur, Paris , and botulinum toxin was confirmed in serum samples and in a food sample (sardines) on 14 September 2023.\u00a0\u00a0The local health authorities inspected the restaurant and all products prepared by the restaurant have been recalled. On 13 September, the local health authorities held a press conference and informed the local healthcare professionals.The national health authorities have issued risk communication advice to sensitize the health care workers about the symptomatology and treatment.Information on cases reported among citizens from foreign countries have been shared with the relevant health authorities in those countries.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Local investigations have identified an estimated 25 persons through credit card receipts who have been exposed (i.e., who likely consumed the suspect food item). The exposure occurred at local level and measures have been implemented to eliminate the source of infection including the removal of the suspected food item, which was not distributed outside the venue. However, given the ranging incubation period of botulism\u2014up to eight days\u2014and that not all customers of the restaurant in Bordeaux may have been identified despite efforts, further cases linked to this event may still occur. This outbreak has occurred at the same time as the Rugby World Cup held from the week of 4 September 2023 attracting followers and rugby teams from all over the world.\u00a0Due to the incubation period up to eight days and the restaurant attracting international visitors, there is a possibility that additional cases among international visitors may be reported either from France or outside of France until 18 September.",
        "WHO Advice": "Prevention of foodborne botulism is based on good practice in food preparation particularly during heating/sterilization and hygiene. Foodborne botulism may be prevented by the inactivation of the bacterium and its spores in heat-sterilized (for example, retorted) or canned products, or by inhibiting bacterial growth and toxin production in other products. The vegetative forms of bacteria can be destroyed by boiling, but the spores can remain viable after boiling even for several hours. However, the spores can be killed by very high temperature treatments such as (commercial) canning.Commercial heat pasteurization (including vacuum packed pasteurized products and hot smoked products) may not be sufficient to kill all spores and therefore the safety of these products must be based on preventing bacterial growth and toxin production. Refrigeration temperatures combined with salt content and/or acidic conditions will prevent the growth of the bacteria and formation of toxin.The neurotoxins themselves are heat-labile and will be destroyed within minutes at temperatures above 80\u00b0C; consequently, only foods improperly processed in which the bacteria or the spores survive, pose a risk.The WHO five keys to safer food serve as the basis for educational programmes to train food handlers and educate the consumers. They are especially important in preventing food poisoning.The five keys are:keep cleanseparate raw and cookedcook thoroughlykeep food at safe temperaturesuse safe water and raw materials.",

        "Outbreak name": "Legionellosis",
        "Date Reported": "14 September 2023",
        "Location": "Poland",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "As of 11 September 2023, a total of 166 cases of legionellosis, including 23 deaths, have been reported from Poland. Legionellosis, more commonly known as Legionnaires' disease, is a pneumonia-like illness, caused by a bacterium, that varies in severity from mild to a severe illness and sometimes fatal form of pneumonia.\nThis observed increase in confirmed cases, and associated hospitalizations and deaths seen since mid-August, is unusual, considering that the number of cases is higher than the annual number reported in Poland since 2016.\nPolish health authorities are coordinating cluster investigation activities, active case finding to identify additional cases, and public health activities to prevent transmission and limit the emergence of new cases, through preventive control measures. Since 7 September, no new cases have been reported, although the infection source has not yet been identified. Investigations are still ongoing to find the source of the outbreak.\nMost people develop Legionnaires' disease by inhaling the bacteria from water or soil. To date there has been no reported direct human-to-human transmission.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 18 August 2023, public health authorities in Rzesz\u00f3w, Poland, announced the detection of a cluster of 158 suspected community-acquired pneumonia cases, including 15 laboratory-confirmed cases of legionellosis among patients admitted to several hospitals in Rzesz\u00f3w.Between 18 August and 11 September 2023, a total of 166 laboratory-confirmed cases, all hospitalized, and 23 associated deaths (CFR of 14%) have been reported. Most cases, 67% (n=112), were recorded in the city of Rzesz\u00f3w, 23% (n=38) of cases in Rzesz\u00f3w county, and 10% (n=16) cases in other locations. Figure 1: Geographic distribution of confirmed Legionellosis cases in Poland between 18 August and 11 September 2023.Preliminary results from an ongoing epidemiological investigation indicate that the first cases developed symptoms on 30 July, while most cases developed symptoms between 12-16 August. Adults between 60 and 90 years are the most affected age group. The most recently reported case has an onset date of 29 August. All 23 related deaths had underlying comorbidities and were between the ages of 53 and 98 (11 females and 12 males).Figure 2: Number of confirmed Legionellosis cases reported in Rzeszow by Epidemic weekLaboratory resultsOnly hospitalized cases are tested for\u00a0Legionella spp. The majority of the cases were confirmed through urine antigen tests and 11 cases were confirmed through respiratory samples by PCR. Culture and sequencing were not possible as the cases were treated with antibiotics.Between 18 August to 11 September 2023, a total of 379 facility inspections were carried out. A total of 222 samples of hot and cold water were taken and investigations are ongoing.",
        "Epidemiology": "Legionellosis is an infection caused by Legionella bacteria. The\u00a0Legionella\u00a0bacteria can cause a mild illness, Pontiac fever, non-pneumonic form of the disease, and Legionnaires\u2019 disease, a severe pneumonia form of illness that can be fatal. Most people catch Legionnaires' disease by inhaling the bacteria from water or soil.Legionnaires\u2019 disease, the pneumonic form, has an incubation period of 2 to 10 days (but up to 16 days have been recorded in some outbreaks). It is an important cause of community- and hospital-acquired pneumonia, and although uncommon, Legionnaires\u2019 disease may cause outbreaks of public health significance. Initially, symptoms are fever, mild cough, loss of appetite, headache, malaise and lethargy, with some patients also experiencing muscle pain, diarrhoea and confusion. The severity of Legionnaires\u2019 disease ranges from a mild cough to rapidly fatal pneumonia. Untreated Legionnaires\u2019 disease usually worsens during the first week.Mortality from Legionnaires\u2019 disease depends on the severity of the disease, the use of antibiotic treatment, the setting where Legionella was acquired, and whether the patient has underlying conditions, including immunosuppression. The death rate may be as high as 40\u201380% in untreated immunosuppressed patients and can be reduced to 5\u201330% through appropriate case management, depending on the severity of the clinical signs and symptoms. Overall, the death rate is usually between 5\u201310%.",
        "Public Health Response": "Meetings of the crisis staff at the Mayor of Rzesz\u00f3w are held daily.Water samples were collected from the water supply system, residences of the sick, healthcare facilities, cooling towers, and installations in buildings\u00a0located in Rzesz\u00f3w, the Rzesz\u00f3w poviat, and the Ropczyce and S\u0119dzisz\u00f3w poviat.An epidemiological investigation, including interviews with patients or relatives, is underway to determine the source of infection.Mapping all positive cases, water sampling sites, and cooling towers is underway.Public fountains, public water sprays, and other public water sources have been shut down temporarily.Rzesz\u00f3w Municipal Water and Sewage Company carried out the routine disinfection of the water supply in the city of Rzesz\u00f3w and adjacent towns on 27\u00a0August 2023.Health care units and long-term care facilities have been instructed to carry out additional inspections of their water systems.Public health advice has been developed and shared across multiple channels.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Legionellosis varies in severity from a mild febrile illness to a severe and sometimes fatal form of pneumonia and is caused by exposure to\u00a0Legionella\u00a0species found in contaminated water and potting mixes. Outbreaks of Legionella have been linked to poorly maintained water systems, particularly cooling towers or evaporative condensers associated with air conditioning and industrial cooling, hot and cold-water systems in public and private buildings, and whirlpool spas.Infection can also occur by aspiration of contaminated water or ice, particularly in susceptible hospital patients. To date, there is no reported human-to-human transmission. Legionnaires' disease requires treatment with antibiotics, and currently, no vaccine is available for Legionnaires' disease.Sporadic outbreaks of Legionnaires' disease have been reported previously in Poland. Between 2017 and 2021, Poland reported between 38 to 74 cases of Legionnaires\u2019 disease annually to the European Surveillance System (TESSy). In 2022, this increased to 111 reported cases.Robust surveillance and response activities are being implemented during the current outbreak, and case numbers have been reduced. Nonetheless, without an identified source of\u00a0Legionella\u00a0bacteria, there is a continued risk of developing Legionellosis for people working or living in the affected areas. Older adults, smokers, and people with weakened immune systems are particularly susceptible to the disease.Travel-associated Legionnaires\u2019 disease (TALD) is a frequent phenomenon, with, on average, about 20% of the cases of legionellosis detected in Europe considered to be travel-associated. The outbreak is reported in the south-eastern city of Rzesz\u00f3w, the main hub for humanitarian aid for Ukraine and the transit hub for international military support for Ukraine; therefore, TALD may be expected in people visiting Rzesz\u00f3w.According to the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), in 2021, the EU/EEA witnessed the highest annual notification rate of Legionnaires\u2019 disease, with 2.4 cases per 100 000 population. The cause of the increased reported incidence observed during that period in Europe remains unclear. Legionnaires\u2019 disease is a notifiable disease in the EU, and the events are closely followed up through ECDC and European Legionnaires\u2019 Disease Surveillance Network (ELDSNet).",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO recommends the continuation of laboratory analyses, case identification and clinical care, contact tracing, outbreak investigation to identify the source(s), implementation of measures to prevent further infections, and enhancement of Infection, Prevention and Control (IPC) measures. IPC measures in health facilities have been enhanced during the COVID-19 pandemic and should be reinforced to prevent healthcare-associated transmission, including measures to control waterborne pathogens.\u00a0 WHO does not recommend any specific different measures for travellers. In case of symptoms suggestive of respiratory illness during or after travel, travellers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history with their healthcare provider. Countries with Legionella cases reported after travel to Poland should notify their regional IHR focal points.WHO advises against applying any travel or trade restrictions on Poland based on the current information available on this event.",

From 30 June to 31 August 2023, a total of 5898 suspected cases were reported from 59 Local Government Areas (LGAs) in 11 states. In week 34 (ending 27 August 2023), 234 suspected cases have been reported from 20 LGAs in five states, with one Lab confirmed case1 from the 22 samples collected. Eighteen of these cases were epidemiologically linked 2 and 141 were classified as clinically compatible.\nDiphtheria is a highly contagious vaccine-preventable disease caused mainly by the bacteria Corynebacterium diphtheriae which can be fatal in 5-10% of cases, with a higher mortality rate in young children.\nWHOs most recent risk assessment of the diphtheria outbreak in Nigeria has maintained the risk as high at the national level, and low at the regional and global levels. Public health measures such as vaccination response, enhanced surveillance for early case detection, case management and risk communication coordinated by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), in collaboration with WHO and other partners, are being implemented in response to the outbreak.",
        "Description of the Situation": "Since the last Disease Outbreak News\u00a0on diphtheria in Nigeria was published on 27 April 2023, the country has reported suspected cases of diphtheria weekly to WHO. However, between 30 June and 31 August 2023, Nigeria recorded an unusual increase in the number of confirmed diphtheria cases4 (figure 1). From 30 June to 31 August 2023, a total of 5898 suspected cases were reported from 59 LGAs in 11 states across the country. The majority (99.4%) of suspected cases were reported from Kano (1816), Katsina (234), Yobe (158), Bauchi (79), Kaduna (45) and Borno (33).\u00a0 Of the cumulative 8353 suspected cases reported since the outbreak was first reported in 2022, 4717 (56.5%) cases were confirmed4 (lab confirmed1 (169; 3.6%), epidemiologically linked2 (117; 2.5%) and clinical compatibility3 (4431; 93.9%)). While 1857 (22.2%) were discarded as not compatible with diphtheria, 1048 (12.5%) cases are pending classification and 731 (8.8%) cases had unknown diagnosis. The case fatality ratio dropped slightly from 6.7% during the last update to 6.1%. Of the 4717 confirmed cases, 3466 (73.5%) were aged 1 \u2013 14 years, of these 699 were aged 0-4 years, 1505 aged 5-9 years, 1262 (aged 10 \u2013 14 years. More than half of the cases (2656; 56.3%) were females. Only 1074 (22.8%) of the confirmed cases were fully vaccinated against diphtheria, 299 (6.3%) were partially vaccinated. More than half of the cases (2801; 59.4%) were unvaccinated. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Figure 1: Diphtheria cases by year/epi-week in Nigeria, 1 May 2022 \u2013 27 August 2023Definitive diagnosis through laboratory molecular testing identified Corynebacterium diphtheriae and Corynebacterium ulcerans isolates as the species driving this outbreak, particularly C. diphtheria as the major etiologic pathogen associated with the current outbreak. Antibiotic susceptibility tests for 62 isolates of C. diphtheriae have been carried out and the findings revealed that all isolates were resistant to penicillin, and most were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfathiazole and ciprofloxacin, while being susceptible to erythromycin. Thus, erythromycin became the drug of choice in the management of this outbreak (Figure 2).

        "Epidemiology": "Diphtheria is a highly contagious vaccine-preventable disease caused mainly by\u00a0Corynebacterium diphtheria\u00a0but also by\u00a0Corynebacterium ulcerans.\u00a0It spreads between people mainly by direct contact or through the air via respiratory droplets. The disease can affect all age groups; however, unimmunized children are most at risk.Symptoms often come on gradually, beginning with a sore throat and fever. In severe cases, the bacteria produce a poison (toxin) that causes a thick grey or white patch at the back of throat. This can block the airways, making it hard to breathe or swallow, and also creates a barking cough. The neck may swell in part due to enlarged lymph nodes.Treatment involves administering diphtheria antitoxin (DAT) as well as antibiotics. Vaccination against diphtheria has been effective in reducing the mortality and morbidity from diphtheria dramatically. Diphtheria is fatal in 5-10% of cases, with a higher mortality rate in young children. However, in settings with poor access to diphtheria antitoxin, the CFR can be as high as 40%.Nigeria has recorded diphtheria outbreaks in the past, notably in 2011 and 2022. In 2023, a previous outbreak of diphtheria was recorded between January and April 2023 affecting 21 of the 36 states and the FCT. Details of the outbreak have been published on\u00a0Disease Outbreak News.",
        "Public Health Response": "Coordination: WHO Country Office Incident Management System revised, National Emergency Operation Centre (EOC) activated likewise state EOC in the diphtheria high burden Kaduna, Katsina, Borno; partners mapping ongoing. Surveillance: Terms of reference for the pillar developed, regular follow up with the states to submit weekly situation report and line-list; WHO and other partners supported NCDC to develop contact tracking and harmonized line-list forms; database for states reporting on response activities p; dashboard for monitoring and evaluation of the response in development; Laboratory: procurement of commodities; activation of Kano lab to perform testing and culture at state level, transportation of samples; Vaccination: reactive vaccination Kano (phase 1 & 2), Katsina, Bauchi, Yobe, Kaduna (phase 1);Risk Communication and Community Engagement: engagement with community leaders, community awareness, development Information Education and Communication material, monitoring rumors, airing jingles, etc. Case management: supported development of national guideline for case management and surveillance; provided technical guidance on case management; deployed ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialists to treatment centers; Infection Prevention Control: monitoring of treatment centers on IPC measures is being undertaken; Operation Support and Logistics: procurement of 10 050 vials diphtheria antitoxin, 15 000 vial erythromycin ETA 28/08 and lab commodities; prepared delivery plan of Personal Protection Equipment to priority states; Preventing and Responding to Sexual Exploitation, Abuse and Harassment: conducted PRSEAH risk assessment.

        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Diphtheria is a vaccine-preventable disease caused mainly by exotoxin-producing Corynebacterium diphtheriae but also by Corynebacterium ulcerans.\u00a0 Diphtheria is fatal in 5 - 10% of cases, with a higher mortality rate in young children. Treatment involves administering DAT as well as antibiotics. Vaccination against diphtheria reduces the mortality and morbidity of diphtheria dramatically.Nigeria is currently facing a second wave of a diphtheria outbreak after a first wave of the outbreak was recorded between epidemiological week 52, 2022 (1 January 2023) and week 20, 2023 (22 May 2023). There is an increase in the affected population with a rise in the number of confirmed cases and related deaths reported in epidemiological weeks 31-33. There is an increased risk of transmission, with clusters and outbreaks reported in newly affected LGAs, with currently 27 LGAs reporting one clinically compatible case in the last three reporting weeks relative to 15 LGAs that had active case in the preceding three weeks.The low national coverage (57%) of the Pentavalent vaccine (Penta 3) administered in routine immunization, and the suboptimal vaccination coverage in the pediatric population\u2014with 43% of the target population unvaccinated\u2014underscores the risk of further spread and the accumulation of a critical mass of susceptible population in the country with sub-optimal herd or population immunity. Vaccine coverage of 80\u201385% must be maintained to ensure community protection.This emphasizes the urgent need to strengthen diphtheria vaccination coverage nationwide, especially in the most affected states, such as Kano. Additionally, particular attention is necessary for regions experiencing insecurity challenges, like the Northwest, as it hampers vaccine accessibility. Due to insecurity, especially in Northeast Nigeria, vaccination coverage remains suboptimal.DAT supply is currently very constrained and insufficient to respond to current demands, as there is only a limited number of manufacturers and large outbreaks are being reported in different regions of the world. \u00a0The NCDC, with support from WHO and other partners have procured 10 050 DAT vials for case management in response to the outbreak.Diphtheria outbreaks are underreported in Nigeria. According to the 2021 Nigeria Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey and National Immunization Coverage Survey, the third dose of pentavalent vaccine (Penta3) coverage was 57% in 2021.WHO second Rapid Risk Assessment for diphtheria in Nigeria reassessed and maintained the risk as high at the national level and low at the regional and global levels.",
        "WHO Advice": "The control of diphtheria is based on primary prevention of disease by ensuring high population immunity through vaccination, and secondary prevention of spread by the rapid investigation of close contacts to ensure prompt treatment of those infected.Epidemiological surveillance ensuring early detection of diphtheria outbreaks should be in place in all countries, and all countries should have access to laboratory facilities for reliable identification of toxigenic C. diphtheriae. Adequate quantities of diphtheria antitoxin should be available nationally or regionally for the medical management of cases.Vaccination is key to preventing cases and outbreaks, and adequate clinical management involves administering diphtheria anti-toxin to neutralize the toxin and antibiotics reducing complications and mortality.WHO recommends early reporting and case management of suspected diphtheria cases to initiate the timely treatment of cases, and follow-up of contacts, and ensuring a supply of diphtheria antitoxin.WHO advises implementing the following Infection Prevention & Control measures in health care settings:1) Apply standard precautions, with focus on hand hygiene, personal protective equipment and equipment and environmental cleaning and disinfection droplet and contact precautions (at all times).2) At screening/triage, immediately place patients with symptoms of Upper Respiratory Tract Infection in a separate area until examined, and, if a suspected case, cohorted with patients with the same diagnosis. Keep the isolation area segregated from other patient-care areas.3) Maintain one meter between patients. Keep patient care areas well ventilated.4) Avoid patient movement or transport out of isolation area. If movement is necessary out of isolation area, have patient use a medical mask and cover any wounds/lesions on patient\u2019s body.The case management should be carried out following the WHO guidelines. In addition, high-risk populations such as young children under five years of age, school children, the elderly, close contact with diphtheria cases, and healthcare workers should be vaccinated on a priority basis. A coordinated response and community engagement can support further transmission and control of the ongoing outbreak. Prophylactic antibiotics (penicillin or erythromycin, dependent on drug sensitivity) are indicated for close contacts of confirmed cases for seven days. If the culture is positive for toxigenic Corynebacterium spp., then the contact should be treated as a case with an antibiotic course for two weeks (DAT is not needed for asymptomatic cases or cases without a pseudomembrane).Although travelers do not have a special risk of diphtheria infection, it is recommended that national authorities remind travelers going to areas with diphtheria outbreaks to be appropriately vaccinated in accordance with the national vaccination scheme established in each country prior to travel. A booster dose is recommended if more than five years have passed since their last dose.",

        "Outbreak name": "Influenza A (H1N1) variant virus",
        "Date Reported": "13 September 2023",
        "Location": "the Netherlands",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 2 September 2023, the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport of the Netherlands notified the World Health Organization (WHO) of a laboratory-confirmed human case of infection with a swine-origin influenza A(H1N1) variant (v) virus in the province of North Brabant, Netherlands. This is the first human infection caused by influenza A(H1N1)v virus reported in the Netherlands in 2023.\nWorldwide sporadic human cases of influenza A(H1N1)v have been reported previously, including from the Netherlands. According to the International Health Regulations (IHR,2005), a human infection caused by a novel influenza A virus subtype is an event that has the potential for high public health impact and must be notified to the WHO.\nThis case was picked up as part of routine surveillance of respiratory illnesses. Based on the available information, there is no clear indication of the source of infection, and no direct contact with pigs was reported. As of 7 September, there were no symptomatic contacts of this case and no further detections have been reported in routine surveillance. All five close contacts were followed for 10 days- the maximum incubation period and none developed symptoms. Thus, there was no evidence of person-to-person transmission and the case is considered as a sporadic human case of influenza A(H1N1)v. The likelihood of community-level spread among humans and/or international disease spread through humans is considered as low.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 2 September 2023, WHO was notified of a confirmed human infection with a swine influenza A(H1N1)v virus, in Netherlands through the European Commission's confidential Early Warning and Response System (EWRS).The case is an adult from the province of North Brabant with no underlying medical conditions and no history of occupational exposure to animals. On 20 August 2023, the patient developed fatigue and general malaise and the following day developed an acute respiratory infection with onset of chills, sneeze, cough, headache, and generalized weakness, followed by fever on 22 August. On 21 August 2023, the patient reported symptoms as part of participatory surveillance[1] of acute respiratory infections and submitted a self-collected combined nose and throat swab specimen to the laboratory. On 22 August 2023, the specimen was forwarded at the Dutch National Influenza Centre location at the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) where it tested positive for influenza A virus and negative for A(H1N1)pdm09, both tests included on a commercial 24 pathogen multiplex nucleic acid amplification assay on 23 August. Further routine subtyping was performed on 24 and 25 August with RT-qPCR assays. Tests for seasonal influenza viruses and H5 viruses were negative. In addition, a laboratory-developed test (LDT) and another commercial assay for generic influenza A virus detection confirmed the presence of type A influenza virus in the specimen.Routine whole genome sequencing using nanopore technique and virus isolation were started on 28 August. On 30 August, sequencing results revealed that the virus, A/Netherlands/10534/2023, is an A(H1N1)v Eurasian avian-like clade 1C.2.2 swine influenza virus. The HA genome segment clustered closely with recent clade 1C.2.2 swine influenza viruses from 2022 and 2023 from the Netherlands.[2] It clustered less closely with previous clade 1C.2.2 A(H1N1)v (from 2019) and A(H1N2)v (from 2020) viruses from the Netherlands. Phenotypically, the virus is sensitive to neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir.The virus isolate will be shared with the WHO Collaborating Centre in London, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH) avian and swine influenza reference laboratory at the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA), UK. The sequences are available from the GISAID database under accession EPI_ISL_18168180.As of 13 September, the person is recovered. Investigations reported that the individual did not work at a pig farm or other business involving pigs and does not work in health care. Therefore, there is no clear indication of the source of infection.",
        "Epidemiology": "Influenza A(H1) viruses are enzootic in swine populations in most regions of the world. When an influenza virus that normally circulates in swine is detected in a person, it is called a \u201cvariant influenza virus\u201d. H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2 are major subtypes of swine influenza A viruses in pigs and occasionally infect humans, usually after direct or indirect exposure to pigs or contaminated environments.Human infections with variant viruses tend to result in mild clinical illness, although some cases have been hospitalized with more severe disease and some have been fatal.Sporadic human infections caused by influenza A(H1N1)v and A(H1N2)v viruses have been reported in the Netherlands previously, and there has been no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission.This is the first human infection caused by swine influenza A(H1N1)v virus reported in 2023 in the Netherlands, and the third human infection over the past five years. Since 1986, nine variant cases have been documented in humans in the Netherlands.",
        "Public Health Response": "National authorities monitored the case and all close contacts. As of 7 September, none of the five close contacts have reported any symptoms. Further antigenic virus characterization is ongoing. The Zoonosis Centre and veterinarians conducted an investigation, but no possible source of infection was identified. \u00a0Therefore, no animal monitoring or testing was performed.Few influenza viruses are currently detected in the Netherlands, and none of these characterized are variant swine influenza A viruses, apart from the current case reported.The (online) participatory surveillance; part of\u00a0www.influenzanet.info is focused on syndromic surveillance among those who may not seek care for their illness and includes a self-test study with over 17 000 participants. Participants are asked each week whether they have symptoms. From those who report a sore throat, runny nose, cough, or dyspnoea up to 200 persons are invited each week to send in a combined nose and throat swab for centralized testing at the RIVM. Over 5500 specimens have been tested since October 2022.[3]",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Most human cases result from exposure to swine influenza viruses through contact with infected swine or contaminated environments. Occasionally, the source of exposure has remained unidentified. As these viruses continue to be detected in swine populations worldwide, further human cases following direct or indirect contact with infected swine can be expected.Current evidence suggests that these viruses have not acquired the ability to sustain transmission among humans. There has been limited, non-sustained human-to-human transmission of variant influenza viruses, although ongoing community transmission has not been identified. In this event, there was no human-to-human transmission resulting in symptomatic disease detected and no further detections have been reported in routine surveillance.The risk of detecting additional cases associated with this event appears to be low.If needed, the risk assessment will be reviewed should further epidemiological or virological information become available.",
        "WHO Advice": "Surveillance:This case does not change the current WHO recommendations on public health measures and seasonal influenza surveillance.WHO does not advise special traveller screening at points of entry or restrictions concerning the current situation of influenza viruses at the human-animal interface.\u00a0Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect virological, epidemiological and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health and timely virus sharing for risk assessment.Notification and investigation:\u00a0All human infections caused by a novel influenza subtype are notifiable under the IHR and State Parties to the IHR (2005) are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic. Evidence of illness is not required.In the case of a confirmed or suspected human infection caused by a novel influenza virus with pandemic potential, including a variant virus, a thorough epidemiologic investigation of a history of exposure to animals, travel, and contact tracing should be conducted. The epidemiologic investigation should include early identification of unusual respiratory events that could signal person-to-person transmission of the novel virus. Clinical samples collected from the time and place of the case should be tested and sent to a WHO Collaboration Center for further characterization.\u00a0Travel and trade:WHO does not recommend any travel and/or trade restrictions for the Netherlands based on the currently available information.\u00a0\u00a0Prevention measures:\u00a0\u00a0General hygiene measures, such as washing hands before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered. Travelers to countries with known outbreaks of animal influenza should avoid farms, contact with animals in live animal markets, entering areas where animals may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with animal faeces. Influenza viruses that infect pigs are different from human influenza viruses. There is no vaccine for influenza A(H1N1)v infection licensed for use in humans. However, some partners develop candidate vaccine viruses (CVV) for novel zoonotic influenza viruses with pandemic potential as part of pandemic preparedness activities.Generally, influenza vaccines against human influenza viruses are not expected to protect people from influenza viruses that normally circulate in pigs. Although the seasonal influenza vaccine does not protect against swine viruses, WHO recommends seasonal influenza vaccination to avoid severe disease from infection with the seasonal influenza virus.",

        "Date Reported": "4 May 2023",
        "Location": "Ethiopia",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "Measles is endemic in Ethiopia, with cases reported every year. Between 12 August 2021 and 1 May 2023, 16 814 laboratory-confirmed measles cases and 182 deaths \u2013 with a Case Fatality Ratio (CFR) of 1.1% - have been reported nationally.\nFrom 2021, the annual number of confirmed measles cases has increased significantly, from 1953 in 2021 to 9291(\u02c3375%) in 2022 and 6933 in 2023 as of 1 May. Thus, there was, an almost five-fold increase in confirmed measles cases between 2021 and 2022.\nLow population immunity, combined with concurrent epidemics, conflict, forced displacement, and other humanitarian crises that disrupt childhood vaccinations, are some factors that may explain the increases.\nMeasles is a highly contagious disease caused by measles virus and it is normally passed through direct contact and through the air. The virus infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body. It can lead to major epidemics with significant illness and death, especially among vulnerable people, such as young children. In 2022, 45% of all cases were children under 5 years of age.\nThere is no specific antiviral treatment for measles, but an effective and safe vaccine is available for prevention and control. A 95% population vaccination coverage is required to stop measles circulation.",
        "Description of the Situation": "Since 12 August 2021, all 13 Regional Health Bureaus in Ethiopia have received reports of suspected measles cases in either host communities, displaced populations, or refugees. Since then, and as of 1 May 2023, 16 814 laboratory-confirmed measles cases and 182 deaths, with a CFR of 1.1% have been reported nationally. From 2021, the annual number of confirmed measles cases has increased significantly, from 1953 in 2021 to 9291(+375%) in 2022, and 6933 so far in 2023 as of 1 May. Thus, there was, a nearly five-fold increase in confirmed measles cases between 2021 and 2022. There are active measles outbreaks reported in 44 woredas/districts from eight regions: Afar, Amhara, Harari, Oromia, Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples Region (SNNPR), South West Ethiopia Peoples\u2019 Region (SWEPR), Tigray and Somali. The number of measles-affected woredas was 52 (5% of the country\u2019s 1080 woredas) in 2021 and 125 (12%) in 2022.Between 1 January to 2 April 2023, the Somali region reported 56 laboratory-confirmed and 364 epidemiologically linked measles cases. In 2022, the nationwide measles incidence rate was 82 cases per one million population. The highest reported rates were in the Somali region, which reported 540 cases per one million population. The lack of reporting associated with the crisis in Northern Ethiopia (Tigray) hampers an adequate assessment of the measles situation.Amongst the confirmed measles cases, only 36% have received one dose or more of the measles-containing vaccine (MCV). According to WHO UNICEF Estimates of National Immunization Coverage (WUENIC) low population immunity (MCV1 and MCV2 coverage in 2021 was estimated at 54% and 46% respectively), combined with concurrent epidemics, conflict, forced displacement, and other humanitarian crises that disrupt childhood vaccinations, are some of the risk factors identified for the increased spread of the disease. Furthermore, cultural beliefs, insufficient awareness, and behavioral characteristics can be a barrier to seeking early treatment and making use of other management strategies for disease management.The country faces various challenges that could exacerbate the situation further, including high rates of malnutrition (nutritional screening during measles SIAs showed that 0.6% of children had severe acute malnutrition 4.7% had global acute malnutrition (GAM) based on over 15,000 children screened) and, a lack of access to health care in conflict-affected areas increasing the risk of severe disease, displacement and crowded conditions poor hygiene and sanitation access and practices increasing the risk of interpersonal spread. According to the latest predictions by the IGAD Climate Prediction and Applications Centre (ICPAC) and National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs) of the Greater Horn of Africa (GHA), Additionally, certain regions affected by drought, such as SNNPR, Oromia, Somali, Afar, and SWEPR, have also reported floods, and around 1.7 million people are at risk of flooding, according to preparedness plans, further risking displacement, disruption of vaccination, and a risk of having people move to crowded settlements increasing the risk of measles circulation.Figure 1.

Woredas reporting active measles outbreaks in Ethiopia from 12 August 2021 to 30 April 2023\u00a0Note: Active outbreak: Three or more measles IgM+ cases reported within one month. Controlled outbreak: No new case reported for the last 30 days after onset of the last case reported.",
        "Epidemiology": "Measles is caused by a virus in the paramyxovirus family. The virus infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body. Measles is a human disease and is not known to occur in animals. It can lead to major epidemics with significant morbidity and mortality, especially among vulnerable people. Among young and malnourished children, pregnant women, and immunocompromised individuals, including those with HIV, cancer or treated with immunosuppressives, measles can cause serious complications, including ear infection, severe diarrhoea, blindness, encephalitis, pneumonia, and death.Transmission is primarily person-to-person by airborne respiratory droplets that disperse rapidly when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Transmission can also occur through direct contact with infected secretions. Transmission from asymptomatic exposed immune persons has not been demonstrated. The virus remains active and contagious in the air or on infected surfaces for up to two hours. A patient is infectious from four days before the start of the characteristic morbilliform rash, to four or five days after its appearance. There is no specific antiviral treatment for measles; most people recover within 2-3 weeks.An effective and safe vaccine is available for prevention and control. The measles-containing vaccine\u2019s first dose (MCV1) is given at nine months, while the second dose of the measles-containing second dose (MCV2) is given at the age of 15 months. A 95% population coverage of MCV1 and MCV2 is required to stop measles circulation.In areas with low vaccination coverage, epidemics typically occur every two to three years and usually last between two and three months. However, their duration varies according to population size, crowding, and the population\u2019s immunity status.",
        "Public Health Response": "The following measures have been undertaken in the country to control the outbreak:Nationwide measles-preventive supplemental immunization activities (SIA) have been conducted from 22-31 December 2022, in all areas except those affected by conflict (all woredas in Tigray, 12 districts in Oromia, and seven in Benishangul Gumuz). A total of 14 579 818 under 5 children were vaccinated out of a target of 15 471 740 resulting in 94.2% coverage.Starting in February 2022, a catch-up measles vaccination campaign was launched, targeting children aged 9 to 23 months. This campaign was conducted in 55 woredas that are high-risk or have been affected by conflict in the Amhara, Oromia, SNNPR, and Somali Regions. The campaign was integrated with vitamin A supplementation and other routine immunization efforts.Support to improve case management, including capacity building and procurement for medications and supplies.Intensification of surveillance activities, including active case search by health extension workers, root cause analyses, and detailed investigations in affected woredas.Intensification of routine immunization through outreach servicesTraining for frontline respondersCommunity engagement and risk communication activities are being conducted through a locally tailored approach.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Measles is a highly contagious disease that occurs seasonally in endemic areas. Measles is still common in many developing countries, particularly in parts of Africa and Asia. Over 95% of measles deaths occur in countries with low per capita incomes and weak health infrastructures. Measles remains an important cause of death among young children globally, despite a safe and effective vaccine being available.There are several challenges that Ethiopia is facing in its efforts to increase national childhood vaccination coverage: conflict, population movement, and an insufficient stock of vaccines at the national level. These challenges are expected to fuel outbreaks and increase the number of cases. The overall risk at the national level is assessed as high due to the following factors:Active outbreaks as of 1 May 2023 in 44 woredas in 8 out of 13 regions:\u00a0 Afar, Amhara, Harari Oromia, SNNPR, SWEPR, Tigray, and Somali;Sub-optimal immunization coverage and low population immunity, Weak surveillance systems result in late detection of cases and inadequate outbreak investigations, especially at the community level. Furthermore, active surveillance is inconsistently implemented, likely resulting in under-reporting of cases and deaths;Poor health awareness in the affected community, resulting in inadequate health promotion and poor health-seeking behavior; Inadequate case management skills in handling complicated cases, further exacerbated by referral challenges associated with lack of transportation especially for patients from remote areas;Concurrent disease outbreaks (for example, cholera, pertussis, circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus) have limited the overall capacity and resources to respond to measles transmission;Concurrent complex humanitarian situations from widespread conflict, displacement, and severe and prolonged drought;Difficulty accessing and delivering supplies due to the poor road network and insecurity in western parts of Oromia, Benishangul Gumuz, Tigray, Afar, and Amhara;Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health system.At the regional level, the overall risk is assessed as moderate due to the following factors:Ongoing severe drought in the Horn of Africa;Ongoing population movement;Conflict and insecurity in multiple countries in the region;Weak cross-border surveillance;Vulnerability of health systems within the region;Ongoing outbreaks within neighboring countries and suboptimal vaccination coverage.The risk has been assessed as low at global level.",
        "WHO Advice": "The key public health strategies to reduce disease burden and transmission include routine vaccination of children against measles, combined with periodic intensification of routine immunization activities (PIRI) and mass immunization campaigns in countries with high morbidity and mortality rates. There is no specific treatment for measles. Case management of measles focuses on supportive care as well as the prevention and treatment of measles complications and secondary infections. Since measles is highly contagious, patient isolation is important to prevent the further spread of the virus.Oral rehydration salts should be used as needed to prevent dehydration. All children diagnosed with measles should receive two doses of vitamin A oral supplements, given 24 hours apart, irrespective of the timing of previous doses of vitamin A; 50 000 international units (IU) should be given to infants aged < 6 months, 100 000 IU to infants aged 6-11 months and 200 000 IU to children aged 12 months. This treatment restores low vitamin A levels in acute measles cases that occur even in well-nourished children and can help prevent eye damage and blindness. Vitamin A supplements have also been shown to reduce the number of measles deaths.Nutritional support is recommended to reduce the risk of malnutrition due to diarrhoea, vomiting and poor appetite associated with measles. Breastfeeding should be encouraged where appropriate.In unimmunized or insufficiently immunized individuals, the measles vaccine may be administered within 72 hours of exposure to the measles virus to protect against disease. If the disease does subsequently develop, symptoms are usually less severe, and the duration of illness may be shortened.WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel or trade to or from Ethiopia.",

        "Date Reported": "1 May 2023",
        "Location": "Nigeria",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "Nigeria is currently experiencing a large outbreak of Lassa fever, with 4702 suspected cases, five probable cases, and 877 confirmed cases between epidemiological weeks 1 and 15 of 2023 (week ending 16 April). Among confirmed cases, there have been 152 deaths (CFR 17%). Lassa fever is endemic in Nigeria and parts of West Africa where the multimammate rat, the main reservoir of the Lassa virus, is common.\nResponding to the current outbreak is challenging due to the need to respond to multiple emergencies simultaneously.\nThe symptoms of Lassa fever vary widely, and diagnosis can be difficult. Most cases (\u223c 80%) are asymptomatic or mild. Still, the infection can result in severe illness and multiple organ dysfunction with or without haemorrhage. Laboratory testing is therefore needed to confirm the diagnosis.\nLaboratory-confirmed cases have been reported in states bordering Cameroon (Adamawa, Benue, Cross Rivers, and Taraba) and states bordering Benin (Oyo and Niger). The overall regional and global risks are considered low because the primary mode of transmission of Lassa fever is through contact with food or household items contaminated with rat excreta. The rate of human-to-human transmission is low.",
        "Description of the Situation": "Nigeria is experiencing a large outbreak of Lassa fever, with 4702 suspected cases, five probable cases, and 877 confirmed cases between epidemiological weeks 1 and 15 of 2023 (week ending 16 April). Among confirmed cases, there have been 152 deaths (CFR 17%). This is a 20% increase in confirmed cases in comparison with those reported during the same period in 2022 (733).Cases have been reported from 101 local government areas (LGAs), in 26 out of 36 states, including the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). A high proportion of confirmed cases (72%) are concentrated in three states: Ondo (32%), Edo (29%) and Bauchi (11%). Laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported in states bordering Cameroon (Adamawa, Benue, Cross Rivers, and Taraba) and states bordering Benin (Oyo and Niger).",
        "Epidemiology": "Lassa fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease caused by the Lassa virus. It is primarily transmitted to humans either through direct contact with infected\u00a0Mastomys\u00a0rodents, or through food or household items contaminated with the urine or faeces of infected rodents. Consequently, the virus is transmitted to humans through cuts and scratches or inhaled via dust particles in the air. Human-to-human transmission can occur through direct contact with an infected person's blood or bodily fluids, but this is rare. Lassa fever can spread in healthcare settings without early recognition and treatment and without adequate infection prevention and control (IPC) measures.Most cases (\u223c 80%) are asymptomatic or mild, but the virus can cause severe disease in the remaining 20% of patients, sometimes associated with multiple organ dysfunction with or without haemorrhage. Lassa fever is difficult to diagnose without proper laboratory tests because it can present with various symptoms, ranging from no symptoms to multiple organ failure and death.\u00a0The case fatality rate is usually between 1% and 15% in patients hospitalized with severe disease. The disease is particularly severe in late pregnancy, with maternal death and/or fetal loss occurring in the third trimester in over 80% of cases. Early supportive care with rehydration and symptomatic treatment is critical and improves survival. The antiviral ribavirin has been used to treat Lassa fever but its efficacy is unproven. There is currently no vaccine that protects against Lassa fever.The disease was first identified in Nigeria in Borno State in 1969 and is endemic in Nigeria. Transmission occurs throughout the year. However, large seasonal outbreaks occur during the dry season, typically from December to April.\u00a0During epidemiological weeks 1 to 15 of 2023, 42 cases were reported among healthcare workers across 11 states. In week 15 of 2023 (10-16 April), 141 new suspected cases, nine new confirmed cases, and one new confirmed death were reported (CFR 11%).\u00a0\u00a0Responding to the current outbreak is challenging due to the need to respond to multiple emergencies simultaneously. These include outbreaks of COVID-19, diphtheria, meningitis, measles, and cholera, and ongoing humanitarian crises. In addition, the country is dealing with security challenges that affect the timeliness of the response.",
        "Public Health Response": "The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (NCDC) and health authorities of affected states are leading the response to the outbreak. An NCDC Emergency Operations Center (EOC) was activated on 28 January 2023 and Rapid Response Teams (RRTs) have been deployed to the states of Bauchi, Benue, Ebonyi, Edo, Ondo, and Taraba.\u00a0\u00a0Response activities include: Surveillance: detection, monitoring of cases and outbreaks, and laboratory testing; Case management;Prevention measures: public education on personal hygiene, food safety, and rodent control in homes and workplaces;Control measures: administration of antiviral drugs to confirmed cases, supportive care, and contact tracing to identify people who may have been exposed to the virus.\u00a0To improve the response to Lassa fever outbreaks in Nigeria, the NCDC has developed a national action plan, with WHO and other partners, to prevent and control Lassa fever outbreaks. This plan focuses on strengthening surveillance activities, improving and expanding national laboratory capacity, increasing public awareness, and improving the availability of treatment and care for patients.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Lassa fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic fever endemic to West Africa.\u00a0Confirmed outbreaks and sporadic cases have been reported in Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Guinea, Ghana, Liberia, Mali, Sierra Leone, Togo and Nigeria. In some regions, Mastomys rodents are consumed as food. \u00a0Although Nigeria is an endemic country for Lassa fever and has developed capacity to manage Lassa fever outbreaks, the current overall risk at the national level is considered high due to several factors: An increase in the number of confirmed cases compared with the same period in previous epidemic seasons; Reduced national capacity due to multiple ongoing health emergencies that have overwhelmed the country's health system and limited access to medical resources; Shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE), resulting in a high risk of healthcare-associated infections; Delays in sample transport for laboratory testing in several states, delaying confirmation of diagnosis and linkage to treatment and care; Inadequate health infrastructure, poor sanitation and the continued presence of disease-carrying rodents; and Lack of awareness and education about Lassa fever among the public and healthcare workers, likely leading to further delays in diagnosis and treatment, increasing the risk of transmission and potential deaths.\u00a0The overall regional and global risks are considered low because the primary mode of transmission of Lassa fever is zoonotic and the rate of human-to-human transmission is low.",
        "WHO Advice": "Prevention of Lassa fever requires the promotion of good community hygiene to prevent rodents from entering homes. Effective measures include storing grain and other food in rodent-proof containers, disposing of garbage away from homes, keeping homes clean, and keeping cats in the home.\u00a0In healthcare settings, staff should always follow standard precautions for the prevention and control of healthcare-associated infections when caring for patients, regardless of the presumed diagnosis. These precautions include hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, personal protective equipment against splashes or other contact with contaminated materials, injection safety, and safe burial rites.\u00a0Healthcare workers caring for suspected or confirmed cases of Lassa fever should take additional infection control measures to avoid contact with the patient's blood or body fluids and contaminated surfaces or materials such as clothing and bedding. When in close contact with patients (within one metre), healthcare workers should wear: face protection (face shield or surgical mask and goggles); a clean, non-sterile, long-sleeved gown; and gloves (sterile for certain medical procedures). No vaccine for Lassa fever is currently available for use in humans. The antiviral drug ribavirin may be an effective treatment for Lassa fever if given early on in the course of the illness, but data are inconsistent. There is no evidence to support the role of ribavirin as post-exposure prophylactic treatment for Lassa fever.\u00a0WHO continues to advise all countries where Lassa fever is endemic to improve early case detection and treatment to reduce fatalities.\u00a0WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel or trade to or from Nigeria based on the information in this report.",

        "Location": "Indonesia",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "Since 2022, Indonesia has recorded an increase in suspected and confirmed measles cases compared to previous years. Between 1 January and 3 April 2023, a total of 2161 suspected measles cases (848 laboratory-confirmed and 1313 clinically compatible [suspected]) have been reported across 18 of 38 provinces in Indonesia, primarily from the provinces of West Java (796 cases), Central Papua (770 cases), and Banten (197 cases).\nMeasles is endemic in Indonesia and is reported every year. However, in 2022 and 2023, there has been a significant increase in the number of confirmed cases, as compared to those reported annually since 2018: there were 920 reported cases in 2018, 639 in 2019, 310 in 2020, and 132 in 2021.\nThe current outbreak is characterized by suboptimal population immunity, including children without measles vaccination. Supplemental immunization activity (SIA) was conducted in 2022, targeting children <15 years old in high-risk provinces (Aceh, North Sumatera, Riau, Riau Islands, and West Sumatera), 9 \u2013 59 months old in provinces in Java-Bali, and 9 months to 12 years old in the remaining provinces, with efforts to strengthen routine immunization and catch-up activities ongoing to address the population immunity gaps.",
        "Description of the Situation": "Between 1 January and 3 April 2023, a total of 2161 measles cases (848 laboratory-confirmed and 1313 clinically compatible [suspected]) have been reported across 18 of 38 provinces in Indonesia, primarily from the provinces of West Java (796 cases), Central Papua (770 cases), and Banten (197 cases).In 2022, a total of 4845 laboratory-confirmed measles cases and six deaths (CFR 0.1%) were reported across 32 of the 38 provinces. The provinces mainly affected were Aceh (978 cases), West Sumatra (859 cases), Riau (500 cases), and East Java (459 cases). Annual trend analysis shows the number of cases reported annually in 2022 and currently in 2023 is higher than usual: there were 920 cases in 2018, 639 cases in 2019, 310 cases in 2020, and 132 cases in 2021 (Figure 1).Figure 1: Number of measles cases reported by month of onset of symptoms and confirmation category. Indonesia. January 2019 \u2013 March 2023.Source: Indonesia Ministry of HealthIn 2022, among the 4845 confirmed measles cases with available age information, 93% (4502) were between 1 and 14 years old. However, a few cases have also been observed in the older age group, with at least 41 cases reported among people over 40. Among the confirmed cases, 67% had not received any dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV), 6% had received one dose, 7% had received both doses, and vaccination history was unknown for 21 % (991) of confirmed cases (Figure 3).In 2023, among the 2076 confirmed cases with available age information, 95% (1978) were between 1 and 14 years of age. Among the confirmed cases, 75% had not received any dose of MCV, while 11% had received one dose, 10% had received both doses, and vaccination history was unknown for 3%. Among these 2076 cases, 100% (212) of those younger than 9 months old, 87% (47) 9-12 months, and 66% (1303) of those aged 1-14 years had not received any dose of MCV (Figure 2).Figure 2: Percentage of vaccination coverage among confirmed measles cases by age group, 1 January to 3 April 2023. Indonesia. (n=2138)Source: Indonesia Ministry of HealthThe current outbreak is mainly characterized by suboptimal population immunity, as evidenced by the increased gap in immunity (Figure 2). According to the WHO/UNICEF Joint Reporting Form (JRF), the vaccination coverage in Indonesia in 2020 was 87% for measles-containing-vaccine first-dose (MCV1) and only 65% for measles-containing-vaccine second dose (MCV2). In 2021, national coverage of MCV1 was 87%, and MCV2 was 59%, with variation in administrative vaccination coverage at the sub-national level; these data indicate a very high number of children are susceptible to measles infection.",
        "Epidemiology": "Measles is a human disease caused by a virus in the paramyxovirus family. The virus infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body. It can lead to major epidemics with significant morbidity and mortality, especially among vulnerable people. Among young and malnourished children, pregnant women, and immunocompromised individuals, including those with HIV, cancer or treated with immunosuppressives, measles can cause serious complications, including severe diarrhea, blindness, encephalitis, pneumonia, and death.Transmission is primarily person-to-person by airborne respiratory droplets that disperse rapidly when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Transmission can also occur through direct contact with infected secretions. Transmission from asymptomatic exposed immune persons has not been demonstrated. The virus remains contagious in the air or on contaminated surfaces for up to two hours. A patient is infectious from four days before the start of the rash to four days after its appearance. There is no specific antiviral treatment for measles, but most people recover within 2-3 weeks.An effective and safe vaccine is available for prevention and control. The MCV1 is given at the age of nine months, while the MCV2 is given at the age of 15 months. A 95% population coverage of MCV1 and MCV2 is required to stop measles circulation.In areas with low vaccination coverage, epidemics typically occur every two to three years and usually last between two and three months. However, their duration varies according to population size, crowding, and the population\u2019s immunity status.Several measles outbreaks have been reported in Indonesia between 2011 to 2023. One of the biggest outbreaks occurred in East Java province in 2016 where 3765 cases were reported, associated with low vaccination coverage levels.",
        "Public Health Response": "Indonesia conducted supplemental immunization activity (SIA) in 2022, targeting children <15 years old for high-risk provinces (Aceh, North Sumatera, Riau, Riau Islands and West Sumatera), 9-59 months old for provinces in Java-Bali, and 9 months to 12 years old for the remaining provinces.Active case search and line listing of fever and rash cases is ongoing. Vitamin A is given to those identified with fever and rash during case investigation.\u00a0 Human resources have been deployed to the affected provinces to improve surveillance, particularly at the community level. Efforts are underway to procure reagents needed for laboratory testing enzyme-link immunosorbent assay (ELISA).Promotion of routine immunization and catch-up activities is taking place via a multisectoral collaboration between the government, the community and partners, including the capacity building of immunization staff, strengthening the routine immunization information system and conducting a routine desk review to evaluate vaccination coverage.Coordination is taking place with the Indonesian Pediatric Society to disseminate the updated clinical management guidelines to health care workers. Capacity building on clinical management in the form of online training was conducted in 2022 in collaboration with the Indonesian Pediatric Society.Job aids have been developed to improve routine immunization coverage.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "While measles is endemic in Indonesia and is reported yearly, the magnitude and extent of this outbreak is high compared to previous years. Based on the current data and available information, the overall risk of measles at the national level is assessed as high for the following reasons:Likely under-detection and under-reporting of measles cases due to non-availability of laboratory reagents for confirmation of cases. The number of suspect measles cases reported in the Early Warning Alert and Response System (EWARS) has continued to increase since week 1 in 2023. An increase in hospitalization of suspect measles cases is observed in some provinces, including Papua province.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Low MCV1 and MCV2 coverage in most provinces, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2021); 28% of the birth cohort in 2021 have not received any measles vaccination and are thus at high risk for measles infection. Also, 22% of the children have been only partially vaccinated. Low measles-containing vaccine supplemental immunization activities (MCV-SIA) coverage in 2022, especially in high-risk provinces. There is vaccine hesitancy in the high-risk provinces, and limited capacity for outbreak response immunization (ORI), which is also impacted due to vaccine hesitancy.\u00a0 Low surveillance sensitivity in 2020-2021. As surveillance improved in 2022, more cases were reported from the subnational level. The overall surveillance sensitivity of measles and rubella i.e., the non-measles non rubella (NMNR) discard rate, was 3.33 per 100,000 population compared to the global standard of \u22652.0 per 100000 population. However, only 33% (170) districts achieved at least 2 NMNR discarded rate. In 2023, NMNR discard rate to date is at 0.46.The B3 genotype detected in West Kalimantan and East Java is not originally endemic to Indonesia.",
        "WHO Advice": "Measles is preventable by vaccination, which provides lifelong immunity in most recipients. In countries with low vaccination coverage, epidemics may occur every two to three years. However, their duration varies according to population size, crowding, and the population's immunity status.The measles vaccine has been in use for nearly 60 years. It is safe, effective, and inexpensive. Vaccination is recommended for all susceptible children and adults for whom the vaccine is not contraindicated. National immunization programs must ensure the safe provision of immunization services that can reach all children with two doses of the measles vaccine. Routine measles vaccination for children and mass immunization campaigns in countries with high case and death rates are key public health strategies to reduce global measles deaths. WHO recommends maintaining sustained homogeneous coverage of at least 95% with the first and second doses of the MCV vaccine and strengthening integrated epidemiological surveillance of measles and rubella to achieve timely detection of all suspected cases in public, private, and social security healthcare facilities. WHO continues to strengthen the global laboratory network to ensure timely diagnosis of measles and track the international spread of the measles viruses to allow a more coordinated country approach in targeting vaccination activities and reducing deaths from this vaccine-preventable disease.It is critical to quickly recognize and treat measles complications to reduce the disease\u2019s severity and mortality. Severe complications from measles can be reduced through supportive care that ensures good nutrition, adequate fluid intake, and treatment of dehydration with WHO-recommended oral rehydration solution. This solution replaces fluids and other essential elements lost through diarrhoea or vomiting. Antibiotics should be prescribed to treat eye and ear infections and pneumonia.While there is no specific antiviral treatment for measles, prompt vitamin A in therapeutic doses is recommended to reduce complications and mortality among children infected with measles. Two doses of vitamin A oral supplements should be given 24 hours apart, irrespective of the timing of previous doses of vitamin A: 50 000 IU should be given to infants aged < 6 months, 100 000 IU to infants aged 6-11 months, and 200 000 IU to children aged 12-59 months. This treatment restores low vitamin A levels in acute measles cases that occur even in well-nourished children and can help prevent eye damage and blindness. Vitamin A supplements have also been shown to reduce the number of measles deaths.WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel or trade to or from Indonesia based on the information presented in this report.",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "Since the beginning of 2023, 557 confirmed cases of diphtheria have been detected in Nigeria, affecting 21 of the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory.\nIn December 2022, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (NCDC) was notified of suspected diphtheria outbreaks in Kano and Lagos States. From 14 May 2022 to 9 April 2023, 1439 suspected cases have been reported, of which 557 (39%) have been confirmed, including 73 deaths among the confirmed cases (case fatality ratio of 13%). Nigeria has previously reported diphtheria outbreaks, with the most significant reported in 2011 affecting the rural areas of Borno State, in the northeast of the country. Diphtheria is a highly contagious vaccine-preventable disease which spreads between people mainly by direct contact or through the air via respiratory droplets. The disease can affect all age groups, however unimmunized children are particular at risk. It is potentially fatal.\nThe disease can be treated by administering diphtheria antitoxin as well as antibiotics. Vaccination against diphtheria has reduced the mortality and morbidity of diphtheria dramatically.",
        "Description of the Situation": "The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (NCDC) was notified of suspected diphtheria outbreaks in Kano and Lagos States on 1 December 2022. In January 2023, the number of confirmed cases increased, peaking at over 150 cases in week 4 of 2023 (ending 28 January); since then, a weekly decreasing trend has been observed. From 14 May 2022 to 9 April 2023, 1439, suspected diphtheria cases were reported from 21 states in Nigeria, with the majority (83%) of cases reported from Kano (1188), Yobe (97), Katsina (61), Lagos (25), Sokoto (14) and Zamfara (13). Of the 1439 suspected cases, 557 (39%) were confirmed (51 laboratory-confirmed, 504 clinically compatible and two epidemiologically linked), 483 (34%) were discarded, and 399 (28%) are pending classification. Laboratory-confirmed cases were reported from Kano (45), Lagos (3), Kaduna (1), Katsina (1), and Osun (1) states. Among the 557 confirmed cases, 73 deaths were recorded, for a CFR of 13%. The CFR has dropped significantly since the beginning of the outbreak due to, among other factors, increased access to diphtheria antitoxin (DAT).Nigeria had recorded diphtheria outbreaks in the past. The most significant outbreak reported was between February and November 2011 in the rural areas of Borno State, north-eastern Nigeria, where 98 cases were reported.\u00a0Figure 1: Epidemic curve of diphtheria cases by year/epi-week in Nigeria, epi-week 19 2022 \u2013 epi-week 14 2023Figure 2: Distribution of Diphtheria cases by state in Nigeria from Epi week 19, 2022 to Epi week 14, 2023",
        "Epidemiology": "Diphtheria is a highly contagious vaccine-preventable disease caused by exotoxin-producing\u00a0Corynebacterium diphtheriae\u00a0It spreads between people mainly by direct contact or through the air via respiratory droplets. The disease can affect all age groups, however unimmunized children are particular at risk. It is potentially fatal. \u00a0Symptoms often come on gradually, beginning with a sore throat and fever. In severe cases, the bacteria produce a poison (toxin) that causes a thick grey or white patch at the back of throat. This can block the airways, making it hard to breathe or swallow, and also creates a barking cough. The neck may swell in part due to enlarged lymph nodes. Treatment involves administering diphtheria antitoxin as well as antibiotics. Vaccination against diphtheria has reduced the mortality and morbidity of diphtheria dramatically. Diphtheria is fatal in 5 - 10% of cases, with a higher mortality rate in young children. However, in settings with poor access to diphtheria antitoxin, the CFR can be as high as 40%.",
        "Public Health Response": "Under the leadership of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (NCDC), coordination and monitoring of diphtheria surveillance and response activities in the country are ongoing through the weekly diphtheria National Technical Working Group meetings.Rapid Response Teams (RRTs) have been deployed to Katsina, Osun and Yobe States and re-deployed to Kano and Lagos States to support response activities.Harmonization of surveillance and laboratory data across states and laboratories is ongoing.Sensitization/training of clinical and surveillance officers has taken place in states where RRTs were deployed, on the presentation, prevention, and surveillance of diphtheria.Cascaded trainings were conducted in their respective states by some of the laboratory scientists/physicians trained at the NCDC National Reference Laboratory (NRL), Abuja.Procurement for reagents and sample collection and transportation materials/media processes has been initiated.Drug sensitivity tests are ongoing at NCDC NRL on isolates sent in from states.Distribution of DAT to the affected states has been ongoing since December 2022.Strengthening of routine immunization activities across the country continues.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Diphtheria cases are under-reported in Nigeria, with few reports of outbreaks in the past. The last outbreak was reported between February and November 2011 in the village of Kimba and its surrounding settlements in Borno State, north-eastern Nigeria, where 98 cases were reported. The diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccine third dose coverage in Nigeria is suboptimal. According to the 2021 Nigeria Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) and National Immunization Coverage Survey (NICS), the third dose of pentavalent vaccine coverage was 57% in 2021.The country is currently faced with several public health emergencies such as Lassa fever, cholera, mpox, meningitis and a humanitarian emergency in the northeast of the country. Due to insecurity, especially in north-eastern Nigeria, vaccination coverage remains suboptimal, especially in the areas controlled by non-state armed groups. Therefore, the outbreak of diphtheria further complicates and strains the already overstretched resources. The global supply of diphtheria antitoxin (DAT) is limited, and this may affect the availability of the required doses in a timely manner.The overall risk of diphtheria in Nigeria was assessed as high at the national level, low at the regional level, and low at the global level.",
        "WHO Advice": "Epidemiological surveillance ensuring early detection of diphtheria outbreaks should be in place in all countries, and all countries should have access to laboratory facilities that allow for the reliable identification of toxigenic\u00a0C. diphtheriae. For the adequate medical management of cases, sufficient quantities of diphtheria antitoxin should be available nationally or regionally.WHO recommends early reporting and management of suspected diphtheria cases to initiate timely treatment of cases and follow-up of contacts and ensure the supply of diphtheria antitoxin. Case management should be carried out following the WHO guideline and involve administering antitoxin to neutralize the toxin and antibiotics to kill the bacteria, reducing complication and mortality. \u00a0As vaccination is key to preventing cases and outbreaks, high-risk populations such as children under five years of age, schoolchildren, close contact of diphtheria cases, and healthcare workers, should be vaccinated with diphtheria-containing vaccines on a priority basis. A coordinated response and community engagement can support control of the ongoing outbreak.Although travellers do not have a special risk of diphtheria infection, it is recommended that national authorities remind travellers going to areas with diphtheria outbreaks to be appropriately vaccinated in accordance with their national vaccination scheme. A booster dose is recommended if more than five years have passed since the last dose.WHO does not recommend any travel and/or trade restrictions to Nigeria based on the information available for this event.",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "Between 1 October 2022 and 16 April 2023, Nigeria reported a total of 1686 suspected cases of meningitis, including 124 deaths, for a case fatality ratio (CFR) of 7%.\nMeningitis is a serious infection of the meninges, the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. It is a devastating disease and a major public health challenge. Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus), Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus) are the main causative agents for meningitis. Vaccines can help prevent meningococcal disease.",
        "Description of the Situation": "From 1 October 2022 to 16 April 2023, a total of 1686 suspected cases, 532 confirmed cases and 124 deaths (CFR: 7%) have been reported from 81 local government areas (LGAs) in 22 out of 36 administrative states, including the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), in Nigeria.\u00a0 Males account for 57% (n = 961) of total suspected cases. The highest proportion of reported cases is among children aged 1 to 15 years. Jigawa state accounts for 74% (n = 1252) of all suspected cases, and this state borders the Zinder region in Niger, where a meningitis outbreak has been reported since October 2022. A total of 481 cerebrospinal fluid samples were collected from patients in 18 states. Out of these samples, 247 tested positive for bacterial infection by PCR test. Among the positive cases, 226 (91%) were caused by Neisseria meningitidis serogroup C (NmC), while 13 cases (5.4%) were caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, and only one case (0.4%) by Haemophilus influenzae. For 232 samples the result was negative, and for two the result is pending. In the last five weeks alone (epidemiological weeks 11-15), 41 out of 140 samples tested (29%) were positive for NmC. The confirmed cases were reported from eight states including Jigawa (231), Zamfara (six), Yobe (five), Benue (one), Gombe (one), Katsina (one), Oyo (one), and Sokoto (one).Fig. 1.\u00a0Map indicating meningitis cases (n = 1686 suspected cases) between 1 October 2022 and 16 April 2023\u00a0Source: Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (NCDC)Jigawa state consists of 27 LGAs, of which 25 have reported at least one suspected case. There have been 66 deaths in Jigawa state. During the current outbreak, Maigatari LGA and Sule-tankarkar LGA have both crossed the epidemic threshold of 10 suspected cases per 100 000 population and account for 60% of the total reported cases, with 505 and 247 cases respectively.The CFR for this outbreak is 7% and 5% at the national and Jigawa state level, respectively.Fig. 2.\u00a0Weekly distribution of meningitis cases (n = 1686 suspected cases) between 1 October 2022 and 16 April 2023",
        "Epidemiology": "Meningitis is a serious infection of the meninges, the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. It is a devastating disease and remains a major public health challenge. The disease can be caused by many different pathogens including bacteria, fungi or viruses, but the highest global burden is seen with bacterial meningitis.Several different bacteria can cause meningitis.\u00a0Streptococcus pneumoniae,\u00a0Haemophilus influenzae, and\u00a0Neisseria meningitidis\u00a0are the most frequent ones.\u00a0N. meningitidis, causing meningococcal meningitis, is the one with the potential to produce large epidemics.Meningococcal meningitis is transmitted from person to person through droplets of respiratory and throat secretions, usually by asymptomatic carriers. Close, prolonged contact with an infected person, or living with a carrier, facilitates the spread of the disease. The average incubation period is four days but can range between two and 10 days.The extended meningitis belt of sub-Saharan Africa, stretching from Senegal in the west to Ethiopia in the east (26 countries) and including the northern part of Nigeria, has the highest disease rates. \u00a0Meningitis in these countries follows a seasonal pattern, being most common during the dry season (December through June) with a peak between March and April, when there is persistent low air humidity and high dust loads that are believed to damage the pharyngeal mucosa and ease the colonization of the nasopharyngeal epithelium by the meningococci. Seasonal epidemics vary in size from year to year.Response measures implemented during an outbreak, including improved case finding and management as well as mass vaccination campaigns, contribute to outbreak control.Meningococcal meningitis remains a public health concern, in Nigeria, with outbreaks reported in recent years. With support from WHO, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (NCDC) is implementing response measures at the national level. These include vaccination, surveillance, active case finding, sample testing, and case management.",
        "Public Health Response": "With support from WHO, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (NCDC) is implementing response measures at the national level. These include:Daily coordination meetings being held at state and LGA levels since December 2022;Surveillance activities with rapid response teams continuing to conduct active case search;Case management activities at public health centres in affected LGAs;Vaccination activities in 17 high-priority wards in the priority LGAs of Maigatari, Sule-tankarkar, Gumel and Gagarawa \u2013 all in Jigawa state.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Nigeria has implemented interventions to combat meningitis, including introducing the meningococcal A (MenA) conjugate vaccine against NmA from 2011-2022. Through preventive campaigns, Nigeria has \u00a0vaccinated over 100 million people aged 1 to 29 years, and the vaccine has been included in the country\u2019s routine immunization schedule since 2019. Among MenA vaccinated populations in countries of the meningitis belt, the incidence of serogroup A meningitis has declined by more than 99%, and no serogroup A case has been confirmed since 2017. However, there are still annual reports of meningitis cases in the country that are associated mostly with meningococcus serogroup C (NmC).Insecurity, particularly in Northeast Nigeria, affects vaccination coverage, especially in areas controlled by non-state armed groups. At the national level, immunization coverage remains suboptimal at 50% as of 2021. Licensed vaccines against meningococcal, pneumococcal and Haemophilus influenzae diseases have been available for many years. These bacteria have several different strains (known as serotypes or serogroups), and vaccines are designed to protect against the most harmful strains. Over time, there have been major improvements in strain coverage and vaccine availability, but no universal vaccine against these infections exists.Additionally, in November 2022, an outbreak of meningitis was confirmed in the Zinder region of Niger. This region borders Jigawa, which is the worst-affected state in Nigeria. The risk of cross-border transmission is high due to the population movement across the border.Based on the above information, the overall risk of meningitis in Nigeria is assessed as high at the national level, moderate at the regional level, and low at the global level.",
        "WHO Advice": "Preventing meningitis through vaccination is the most effective way to reduce the burden and impact of the disease by delivering long-lasting protection. The anticipated rollout of multivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccines is a public health priority to eliminate bacterial meningitis epidemics in the African meningitis belt.Early diagnosis and treatment are critical in managing all types of meningococcal disease. Appropriate case management, active community-based case-finding, and reactive mass vaccination of affected populations are necessary in response to epidemics. Currently, there is an ongoing reactive vaccination campaign. To guide further response activities, it is crucial to monitor the spread of the disease to new areas, including considering further vaccine requests if appropriate. Timeliness of the reactive campaign is essential, with the goal being to initiate it within four weeks of crossing the epidemic threshold.WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel and trade to Nigeria based on the currently available information.",

        "Date Reported": "21 April 2023",
        "Location": "Chile",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "This Disease Outbreak News is an update on the report published on 6 April 2023 concerning human infection caused by avian influenza A(H5N1) in Chile. Since then, WHO received information on the results of genomic sequencing and the ongoing public health response.\nOn 5 April, the results of genomic sequencing were completed by the Institute of Public Health of Chile (ISP per its acronym in Spanish), which is the National Influenza Centre (NIC) in Chile, which identified avian influenza virus A(H5N1) phylogenetic clade 2.3.4.4b. The genomic sequencing had 99.9% identity with H5 hemagglutinin sequences from Chilean birds, and complete neuraminidase (NA) had 100% identity with N1 sequences from Chilean birds.\nA total of 12 contacts (close contacts and healthcare workers) were identified. All tested negative for influenza and have completed the monitoring period. No further cases in Chile have been identified so far.\nAvian influenza infection in a human can cause severe disease and is notifiable under the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005) [1].",
        "Description of the Situation": "As reported previously, on 29 March 2023, the Ministry of Health of Chile notified WHO of the detection of human infection with avian influenza A(H5) virus.On 7 April 2023, the Chile International Health Regulations National Focal Point reported the results of genomic sequencing completed on 5 April 2023 by the NIC, which identified avian influenza A(H5N1) phylogenetic clade 2.3.4.4b. The patient is a 53-year-old male from the Region of Antofagasta in the north of Chile. He had no history of comorbidities or recent travel.On 13 March 2023, the patient developed symptoms including cough, sore throat, and hoarseness. On 21 March, due to worsening symptoms, he sought care at a local hospital. On 22 March 2023, the patient developed dyspnea and was admitted to a Regional Hospital at Antofagasta (SARI Sentinel Site). A nasopharyngeal swab sample was collected as part of routine severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) surveillance and tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). On 23 March, the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit and treatment with antivirals (oseltamivir) and antibiotics was initiated. The patient remains in respiratory isolation under multidisciplinary management, with mechanical ventilation due to pneumonia.\u00a0Standard infection control precautions were kept since the detection of the case. On 27 March, a bronchoalveolar sample was collected and tested positive for an unsubtypeable influenza A virus by PCR. The sample was sent to the ISP and tested positive for avian influenza A(H5) on 29 March. On 31 March, the NIC forwarded the patient's samples to a WHO Collaborating Centre for further characterization.\u00a0On 5 April, the results of genomic sequencing were completed by the NIC in Chile, which identified avian influenza virus A(H5N1) phylogenetic clade 2.3.4.4b. The genomic sequencing had 99.9% identity with H5 hemagglutinin sequences from Chilean birds, and complete neuraminidase (NA) had 100% identity with N1 sequences from Chilean birds.\u00a0 Three close contacts of the case were identified, all asymptomatic, tested negative for influenza and have concluded the monitoring period. Additionally, a total of nine contacts among healthcare workers were identified, all tested negative for influenza and concluded the monitoring period on 4 April. However, on 5 April one of them developed respiratory symptoms, therefore a nasopharyngeal swab was taken, which tested negative for influenza; the monitoring period for this contact was extended for seven additional days, ending on 11 April.Avian influenza A (H5N1) was first detected in the Region of the Americas in birds in December 2014. Between December 2022 and February 2023, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has been detected in wild aquatic birds (pelicans and penguins) and sea mammals (sea lions) in the Antofagasta Region where the case resides. According to preliminary findings of the epidemiological investigation of this human case, the most plausible route of transmission was through environmental exposure, given the large number of dead sea mammals and wild birds found in the area close to the patient\u00b4s residence.",
        "Epidemiology": "Zoonotic influenza infections in humans may range from asymptomatic or mild upper respiratory infection (fever and cough) to rapid progression to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, shock, and death, depending on factors related to the virus and the host. Rarely, gastrointestinal, or neurological symptoms have been reported. Human cases of avian influenza are usually the result of direct or indirect exposure to infected live or dead poultry or contaminated environments.In the Region of the Americas during 2022 and 2023, an increasing number of outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5) have been reported in backyard poultry, farm poultry, wild birds, and wild mammals. Since the first confirmation of avian influenza A(H5N1) in the region in 2014, three human infections caused by avian influenza A(H5) have been reported: the first in the United States of America, reported in April 2022; the second in Ecuador, reported in January 2023; and this case. Globally, since 2003, 873 human infections with A(H5N1) viruses, including 458 deaths (CFR 52%), have been reported to WHO.",
        "Public Health Response": "Additional public health activities have been reported since the last update. Intersectoral activities have been carried out by the Ministry of Health of Chile, the Agricultural and Livestock Service (SAG) and the National Fisheries and Aquaculture Service of Chile (SERNAPESCA), of the Ministry of Agriculture of Chile, among others, in order to follow up on the avian influenza outbreaks in Antofagasta Region and outbreaks in other Regions.Active monitoring of persons with respiratory symptoms and exposure to wild birds, poultry, and sea mammals has been undertaken.Seasonal influenza vaccination is being conducted in risk groups according to the guidelines of the National Immunization Program.\u00a0Regarding risk communication, the population has been informed about this case and prevention measures through messaging for different target audiences.The Ministry of Health of Chile is participating actively in the Disaster Risk Management Committee of the National Service for Disaster Prevention and Response (SENAPRED) to deal with the animal health emergency.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "WHO\u2019s risk assessment remains unchanged since the last update.  According to the preliminary findings of the local epidemiological investigation, the most plausible hypothesis about transmission is that it occurred through environmental exposure to areas where either sick or dead birds or sea mammals were found close to the residence of the case. According to the information received thus far, the virus has not been detected in other individuals. Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, wild birds or mammals, there is a risk for sporadic infection and small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected animals or contaminated environments. Public health measures have been implemented by both the human and animal health agencies, including monitoring healthcare workers and other contacts of the laboratory-confirmed case. Currently available epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that A(H5) viruses, including H5N1, have not acquired the capacity for sustained transmission among humans, thus the likelihood of human-to-human spread is low. Based on available information, WHO assesses the risk to the general population posed by this virus to be low. Should infected individuals from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during travel or after arrival. If this were to occur, further community-level spread is considered unlikely as this virus has not acquired the ability to transmit easily among humans. The preliminary risk assessment will be reviewed as needed should further epidemiological or virological information become available.",
        "WHO Advice": "Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, and the large outbreaks among animal populations, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect and monitor virological, epidemiological, and clinical changes associated with emerging or circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health, and of timely virus sharing for risk assessment. The diversity of zoonotic influenza viruses that have caused human infections is alarming and necessitates strengthened surveillance in both animal and human populations, thorough investigation of every zoonotic infection, and pandemic preparedness planning. Vaccination of poultry workers with seasonal influenza vaccine has been advised to prevent a viral mutation that could facilitate human-to-human transmission.WHO does not advise special traveler screening at points of entry. \u00a0In the case of a confirmed or suspected human infection with a novel influenza virus with pandemic potential, including avian influenza and variant viruses, contact tracing should be initiated and a thorough epidemiologic investigation of history of exposure to animals and of travel should be conducted. The epidemiologic investigation should include early identification of unusual clusters of respiratory disease that could signal person-to-person transmission of the novel virus, and clinical samples collected from the time and place that the case occurred should be tested and then sent to a WHO Collaborating Centre for further characterization. There are no approved vaccines for preventing influenza A(H5) in humans. Candidate vaccine viruses to prevent influenza A(H5) infection in humans have been developed for pandemic preparedness purposes.\u00a0Given the observed extent and frequency of avian influenza cases in wild birds and some wild mammals, the public should avoid contact with animals that are sick or dead from unknown causes and should report the occurrence to the authorities.Travelers to countries with known outbreaks of animal influenza should avoid farms, contact with animals in live animal markets, entering areas where animals may be slaughtered, or contact with\u00a0any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with animal faeces or other body fluids. Travelers should also wash their hands often with soap and water and follow good food safety and food hygiene practices.Close analysis of the epidemiological situation, further characterization of the most recent viruses found in humans and animals, and serological investigations, are critical to assess risk and to adjust risk management measures in a timely manner. All human infections caused by a novel influenza subtype are notifiable under the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005), and States Parties to the IHR are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic. Evidence of illness is not required for this notification.",

        "Description of the Situation": "On 13 February 2023, the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare of Equatorial Guinea declared an outbreak of Marburg virus disease (MVD) after suspected viral hemorrhagic fever deaths were reported between 7 January and 7 February 2023, and a case tested positive on 12 February for Marburg virus by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at the Institute Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal.Since the last Disease Outbreak News on this event (22 March 2023) and as of 11 April 2023, six additional laboratory-confirmed cases of MVD were reported in Equatorial Guinea, bringing the total of cases in the outbreak to 15 laboratory-confirmed. Additionally, 23 probable cases have been reported since the start of the outbreak. Eleven deaths were recorded among laboratory-confirmed cases (Case Fatality Ratio (CFR) among confirmed cases 78.6%), and all probable cases are dead; for one confirmed case the outcome is unknown. Four laboratory-confirmed cases (26.6%) were reported among healthcare workers, of whom two died. Among the confirmed cases, three have recovered.Figure 1. MVD cases by week of onset* and case classification, Equatorial Guinea, as of 11 April 2023. Among MVD laboratory-confirmed cases with age and sex information (n = 13), the majority occurred among females (9/14; 64.3%), while the most affected age group is 40-49 years (6/14; 42.8%), followed by the age groups 10-19 and 30-39 (three cases each).Five districts (Bata, Ebebiyin, Evinayong, Nsok Nsomo and Nsork) in four provinces (Centro Sur, Kie Ntem, Litoral and Wele-Nzas) have been affected by the outbreak (Figure \u00a02), with Bata district reporting the majority of confirmed cases (n = 9) and deaths (n = 6), and Ebebiyin district, where the outbreak was first detected, reporting the majority of probable cases,(n = 11) (Table 1).In the last 21 days (from 22 March 2023 to 11 April 2023),\u00a0five confirmed cases were reported from Bata (n = 4) and Nsork (n = 1) districts (Figure 3). Among the four cases reported from Bata district, three cases have an epidemiological link either through a family cluster or through health care setting.\u00a0The fourth and most recent case was reported on 7 April; an investigation of this case is ongoing to establish transmission chains and ensure appropriate identification of all contacts.Since the last Disease Outbreak News\u00a0on this event, one new district, Nsork in Wele-Nzas province, has been affected by the outbreak, reporting one confirmed case, linked to a known case from another district that previously reported confirmed cases.Since the start of the outbreak and as of 10 April 2023, a total of 1322 contacts have been listed, with an average follow-up rate around 80-90%.Table 1.\u00a0Number of MVD cases and deaths, by district and case classification, Equatorial Guinea, as of 11 April 2023.

        "Epidemiology": "Marburg virus spreads between people via direct contact through broken skin or mucous membranes with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people, and with surfaces and materials such as bedding, clothing contaminated with these fluids. Healthcare workers have previously been infected while treating patients with suspected or confirmed MVD. Burial ceremonies that involve direct contact with the body of the deceased can also contribute to the transmission of Marburg virus. The incubation period varies from two to 21 days. Illness caused by Marburg virus begins abruptly, with high fever, severe headache, and severe malaise. Severe haemorrhagic manifestations may appear between five and seven days from symptom onset, although not all cases have haemorrhagic signs, \u00a0and fatal cases usually have some form of bleeding, often from multiple areas.\u00a0Although no vaccines or antiviral treatments are approved to treat the virus, Remdesivir is being used on compassionate care bases. Supportive care \u2013 rehydration with oral or intravenous fluids \u2013 and treatment of specific symptoms improve survival. A range of potential treatments are being evaluated, including blood products, immune therapies, and drug therapies.\u00a0This is the first time that Equatorial Guinea has reported an outbreak of MVD. Another MVD outbreak is currently taking place in Tanzania with a total of eight confirmed cases and five deaths as of 4 April 2023. Other MVD outbreaks have been previously reported in Ghana (2022), Guinea (2021), Uganda (2017, 2014, 2012, 2007), Angola (2004-2005), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (1998 and 2000), Kenya (1990, 1987, 1980) and South Africa (1975).",
        "Public Health Response": "Coordination The Government has activated a regional public health emergency operation center (PHEOC) in Bata under the leadership of the Minister of Health and the Minister Delegate.A national operational response plan has been developed by the MoH.Regular meetings are held by the MoH to coordinate response activities at national, regional and district level.Partners from the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) have been mobilized to assist response activities. In collaboration with Incident Management team GOARN issued Request for assistance on 30 March. Several experts are deployed and in process of being deployed to support case management, infection prevention and control, laboratory, and epidemiology and surveillance functions in the field.SurveillanceWHO supported the Ministry of Health in setting up an alert and dispatch center for MVD alert management across the region.WHO is supporting the Ministry of Health in training for surveillance activities, including case investigation, contact tracing, active case search in health facilities and the community, and in supervising field teams.WHO is supporting the Ministry of Health in epidemiological data collection and management system, and developed and disseminated a reviewed case definition, validated by the Ministry of Health.Laboratory With the support of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and WHO, a laboratory with RT-PCR capacities has been set up in Bata for MVD diagnostic. \u00a0WHO is supporting the implementation of a specimen transportation system, and discussions are on-going to support the establishment of sequencing capacities in the country. Additional national staff are being trained on Marburg virus diagnostics by the WHO.\u00a0Clinical careWHO supported the Ministry of Health in the establishment an operational treatment and isolation centre in Bata, and is planning to open additional treatment facilities in other districts.Assessments visits were carried out at identified treatment and isolation centers to identify and address gaps.WHO is supporting awareness campaigns of clinical staff to help surveillance and reporting.Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) An IPC task force has been initiated, and a national IPC strategy is currently in draft form.An IPC Scorecard for assessment of health facility IPC practices for readiness and response to Marburg has been implemented.Trainings for health workers on IPC are in progress, including decontamination and safe and dignified burial teams (SBD).Safe and dignified burials teams have been established in Bata and Ebibeyin.Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE) WHO is coordinating with other key partners for joint support on RCCE activities (UNICEF, IFRC among others).WHO is supporting public awareness and capacity building for RCCE national experts, social mobilisers and community leaders (such as Civil Society Organizations, religious leaders, and women groups).The recruitment of national RCCE consultants and deployment of an international expert have been conducted. An RCCE national plan is under development and a rapid social behavioural survey is being prepared for implementation. The Message Bank for Marburg has been developed and disseminated. The message bank is available in Spanish and English, with ongoing translation in Swahili, French and Portuguese.A list of frequently asked questions and answers on Marburg virus disease, which will be accessible to the public, is under development.WHO is providing technical support to the development of tools and education and communication (IEC) materials for preparedness in Gabon and Cameroon.\u00a0Border health and points of entryA needs and capacity assessment has been conducted to strengthen response capacities at points of entry through, for example, the development of contingency plans and standard operating procedures, the training of point-of-entry staff on the identification of signs and symptoms of MVD and the management of potential cases, implementation of risk communication and community engagement activities and the provision of handwashing and transportation capabilities. WHO is working with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) on an upcoming webinar to raise awareness on the necessary border health readiness and response activities in the context of MVD outbreaks for affected and neighboring countries.\u00a0Operational support and logistics (OSL)\u200bWHO has established support for fleet management including two ambulances on standby 24/7 at the Bata treatment centr\u200be, and over 20 vehicles. WHO has provided essential medicines and supplies.\u00a0Readiness and preparedness in neighboring countries WHO has conducted a second readiness assessment across all pillars for the two surrounding countries, Cameroon and Gabon, and based on their gaps, activities to address them will be recommended including the deployment of experts to support the implementation of some of the readiness activities. The WHO is working with Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea and Gabon to coordinate a high-level cross-border meeting.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Equatorial Guinea is facing an outbreak of MVD for the first time and the country's capacity to manage the outbreak needs to be strengthened. In addition to the nine confirmed cases reported in the Disease Outbreak News of 22 March, six more individuals have tested positive for MVD, with an additional affected province. While many cases are linked within a social network or by geographic proximity, the presence of cases and/or clusters across multiple districts without clear epidemiologic links may indicate undetected transmission of the virus. The presence of confirmed cases in Bata increases the risk of disease spread, as it is the most populated city and economic hub of Equatorial Guinea, with an international airport and port. Bata has also reported the highest number of confirmed cases and confirmed deaths. The last case was also reported from Bata and investigation is ongoing to establish transmission chains. The country surveillance system remains suboptimal with few alerts reported and investigated. Several epidemiological links and transmission chains have not been detected, thus there might be contacts not identified. Implemented infection prevention and control measures are insufficient as demonstrated by MVD cases reported among healthcare workers. The diagnostic capacity for Marburg virus in the country is limited in terms of the number of samples that can be analyzed per day (a maximum of around 50 a day).\u00a0The community's perception of risk is estimated to be very low.\u00a0There are frequent population movements between the different districts of the mainland region, as well as with the island region, despite the quarantine measures implemented in several of the affected areas. Frequent population movements and very porous land borders are also reported in the districts bordering Cameroon and Gabon, with surveillance at land entry points being suboptimal, and countless uncontrolled paths or trails along the border with Cameroon and Gabon.\u00a0Also, surveillance at the entry points of the international Bata airport or international seaport, is not optimal.\u00a0Considering the above-described situation, on 30 March 2023, WHO assessed the risk posed by this outbreak as very high at the national level, high at sub-regional level, moderate at the regional level and low at the global level.",
        "WHO Advice": "Marburg virus disease outbreak control relies on using a range of interventions, such as prompt isolation and case management; surveillance including active case search, case investigation and contact tracing; an optimal laboratory service; infection prevention and control, including prompt safe and dignified burial; and social mobilization. Community engagement is key to successfully controlling Marburg disease outbreaks. Raising awareness of risk factors for infection with Marburg virus and the protective measures that individuals can take is an effective way to reduce human transmission. Health and care workers caring for patients with confirmed or suspected MVD should apply IPC measures including standard and transmission-based precautions to avoid contact with the patient\u2019s blood and body fluids and with contaminated surfaces and objects. Health facilities should ensure environmental controls, such as adequate water, sanitation and hygiene, as well as that safe infectious waste management protocols are in place to enable health workers to practice IPC measures. WHO recommends that male survivors of MVD practice safer sex for 12 months from onset of symptoms, or until their semen twice tests negative for the Marburg virus. Contact with body fluids should be avoided and washing with soap and water is recommended. WHO does not recommend isolation of male or female convalescent patients whose blood has tested negative for the Marburg virus.Based on the available information and current risk assessment, WHO advises to strengthen surveillance at points of entry in the affected areas in Equatorial Guinea for the identification of cases, including through exit screening; to map cross-border population mobility to identify populations in vulnerable situations and target public health interventions; and to provide public health information and advice in all relevant languages at points of entry and in adjacent communities near land borders. In addition, suspect, probable and confirmed cases and their contacts should not undertake travel, including international. WHO advises against any other international travel and/or trade measures in Equatorial Guinea.States Parties adopting international travel- and trade-related measures potentially more restrictive than those advised by WHO, are invited to report them to WHO, pursuant to Article 43 of the International Health Regulations (2005).",

        "Outbreak name": "Avian Influenza A(H3N8)",
        "Date Reported": "11 April 2023",
        "Location": "China",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 27 March 2023, the National Health Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China notified WHO of one confirmed case of human infection with an avian influenza A(H3N8) virus. This is the third reported case of human infection with an avian influenza A(H3N8) virus; all three cases have been reported from China.\nEpidemiological investigation and close contact tracing have been carried out. There have been no other cases found among close contacts of the infected individual.\nBased on available information, it appears that this virus does not have the ability to spread easily from person to person, and therefore the risk of it spreading among humans at the national, regional, and international levels is considered to be low. However, due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO stresses the importance of global surveillance to detect virological, epidemiological and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses which may affect human (or animal) health.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 27 March 2023, the National Health Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China notified WHO of one confirmed case of human infection with an avian influenza A(H3N8) virus. The patient was a 56-year-old female from Guangdong province with an onset of illness on 22 February 2023. She was hospitalized for severe pneumonia on 3 March 2023 and subsequently died on 16 March 2023.The case was detected through the severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) surveillance system. The patient had multiple underlying conditions. She had a history of exposure to live poultry before the onset of the disease, and a history of wild bird presence around her home. No close contacts of the case developed an infection or symptoms of illness at the time of reporting. Environmental samples were collected from the patient's residence and the wet market where the patient spent time before the onset of illness. The results of testing showed that the samples collected from the wet market were positive for influenza A(H3).",
        "Epidemiology": "Zoonotic influenza infections in humans may be asymptomatic or may cause disease. Depending on factors related to the specific virus and the infected host, disease can range from conjunctivitis or mild flu-like symptoms to severe acute respiratory disease or even death. Gastrointestinal or neurological symptoms have been reported but these are rare.Human cases of infection with avian influenza viruses are usually the result of direct or indirect exposure to infected live or dead poultry or contaminated environments.",
        "Public Health Response": "The Chinese government has taken the following monitoring, prevention, and control measures:Enhanced monitoring and disinfection in the surrounding environment of the patient\u2019s residence and suspected exposure areas;Public risk communication activities to improve public awareness and adoption of self-protection measures.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Avian influenza A(H3N8) viruses are commonly detected globally in animals. Influenza A(H3N8) viruses are some of the most commonly found subtypes in birds, causing little to no sign of disease in either domestic poultry or wild birds. Cross-species transmission of A(H3N8) avian influenza viruses has been reported for various mammal species, including being endemic in dogs and horses. This is the third reported human infection with A(H3N8) from China. Two previous cases were reported in April and May 2022. One of the previous cases developed a critical illness, while the other had a mild illness. Both cases likely acquired infection from direct or indirect exposure to infected poultry. So far, no additional cases linked with this case, nor the previous cases, have been reported. According to reports from health officials, the preliminary epidemiological investigation into this event suggests that exposure to a live poultry market may have been the cause of infection. However, it is still unclear what the exact source of this infection is and how this virus is related to other avian influenza A(H3N8) viruses that are circulating in animals. To better understand the current risk to public health, more information is needed from both human and animal investigation.The transmission of avian influenza viruses from birds to humans is usually sporadic and happens in a specific context: most human infections with avian influenza viruses that have been reported previously were due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. Since avian influenza viruses continue to be detected in poultry populations, further sporadic human cases are expected in the future. The available epidemiological and virological information suggests that avian influenza A(H3N8) viruses do not have the capacity for sustained transmission among humans. Therefore, the current assessment is that the likelihood of human-to-human spread is low. However, due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect virologic, epidemiologic and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses which may affect human (or animal) health.",
        "WHO Advice": "To minimize the risk of infection, countries should increase public awareness of the importance of avoiding contact with high-risk environments such as live animal markets/farms, live poultry, or surfaces that may be contaminated by poultry or bird faeces. It is recommended to maintain good hand hygiene by frequently washing hands or using alcohol-based hand sanitizer and wearing respiratory protection when in a risky environment.Given the observed extent and frequency of avian influenza cases in wild birds and some wild mammals, the public should avoid contact with animals that are sick or dead from unknown causes and should report the occurrence to the authorities. Travellers to countries with known outbreaks of animal influenza should avoid farms, contact with animals in live animal markets, entering areas where animals may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with animal faeces or other body fluids. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water and follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.WHO advises against the application of travel or trade restrictions based on the information available at this time. Influenza viruses are constantly evolving and large outbreaks occur among animal populations, which is why WHO stresses the importance of global surveillance to detect any changes in virology, epidemiology, and clinical patterns associated with emerging or circulating influenza viruses, which may pose a threat to human or animal health. Collaboration between the animal and human health sectors is essential. As the extent of influenza viruses circulation in animals is not clear, epidemiologic and virologic surveillance and the follow-up of suspected human cases should continue systematically. Timely sharing of information is critical for risk assessment. The variety of zoonotic influenza viruses that have led to human infections is worrying and demands increased surveillance in both animal and human populations, as well as a comprehensive examination of each zoonotic infection, and planning for pandemics. To prevent a viral mutation that could make human-to-human transmission easier, poultry workers have been recommended to receive seasonal influenza vaccination. If a human infection with a novel influenza virus that has pandemic potential, such as avian influenza, is confirmed or suspected, even before receiving confirmatory laboratory results, \u00a0contact tracing should be immediately initiated. A thorough epidemiological investigation should be conducted, including a history of travel and exposure to animals . The investigation should also involve early identification of unusual clusters of respiratory disease that could indicate person-to-person transmission of the novel virus. Clinical samples collected from the time and place that the case occurred should be tested, and then sent to a WHO Collaborating Centre for further characterization.Close analysis of the epidemiological situation, further characterization of the most recent viruses found in humans and poultry, and serological investigations, are critical to assess risk and to adjust risk management measures in a timely manner.Under the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005), States Parties are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of human infection caused by a new subtype of influenza virus. Investigation, virus sharing, and genetic and antigenic characterization of every human infection are essential.This event does not change the current recommendations from WHO for public health measures and surveillance of influenza.",

        "Date Reported": "11 April 2023",
        "Location": "Togo",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "Since mid-December 2022, Togo has been responding to a meningitis outbreak that has so far resulted in a total of 141 cases and 12 deaths (CFR 8.5%), with almost half of the cases affecting children and young adults between 10 and 19 years of age. Overall, 22 samples have been confirmed as Streptococcus pneumoniae.\nTogo is located in the African meningitis belt, with seasonal outbreaks recurring every year. However, the current outbreak is concerning due to different concomitant factors, including the security crisis in the Sahel which causes population movements, and suboptimal surveillance capacity. This is also the country\u2019s first time dealing with a pneumococcal meningitis outbreak.\nAn incident management system has been established to coordinate the outbreak response activities, and WHO is supporting the shipment of antibiotics (ceftriaxone) to improve case management.\nWHO assesses the overall risk posed by this outbreak as high at the national level, moderate at the regional level, and low at the global level.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 15 February 2023, the Ministry of Health of Togo officially declared a meningitis outbreak in Oti Sud district, Savanes region, in the northern part of the country. From 19 December 2022 to 2 April 2023, a total of 141 suspected cases of meningitis with 12 deaths (CFR 8.5%) have been reported from Oti Sud district, corresponding to an attack rate of 112 per 100 000 population.Figure 1. Number of reported meningitis cases and deaths, 19 December 2022 (week 51 of 2022) to 2 April 2023 (week 13 of 2023), Oti Sud district, Savanes region, Togo. A total of 118 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were collected from suspected cases, of which 22 were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and culture for Streptococcus pneumoniae at the national reference laboratory (81 samples were negative and the results for 15 samples are pending).The most affected age group is 10\u201319 years (47%; n = 66), followed by the \u226530-year age group with 20% (n = 28) of cases, and the 20-29 year age group with 15% (n = 22) of cases. There is no difference in the case distribution by gender, with 71 (53%) cases reported among males.Togo introduced the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugated vaccine (PCV13) in 2014, which is currently administered in three doses at the first, second and third months of life. The administrative PCV13 coverage in the Savanes region is 100% for the third dose, but the immunization history is not available for the individual cases, and it is not known if the serotype(s) involved are covered by the vaccine. Additionally, the most affected age groups were born before the PCV13 introduction in 2014 and could have not received the vaccine.",
        "Epidemiology": "Meningitis is a devastating disease with a high case fatality rate and serious long-term complications (sequelae). It remains a major global public-health challenge. Many organisms can cause bacterial meningitis.\u00a0Neisseria meningitidis,\u00a0Streptococcus pneumoniae, and\u00a0Haemophilus influenzae\u00a0type b constitute the majority of all cases of bacterial meningitis and 90% of bacterial meningitis in children. It is estimated that about one million children die of pneumococcal disease every year.Streptococcus pneumoniae\u00a0is an encapsulated bacterium, and about 90 distinct pneumococcal serotypes have been identified throughout the world, with a small number of these serotypes being able to cause disease. Pneumococci are transmitted by direct contact with respiratory secretions from patients and healthy carriers. Serious pneumococcal infections include pneumonia, meningitis and febrile bacteraemia; otitis media, sinusitis and bronchitis are more common but less serious manifestations. The incubation period is two to 10 days. Pneumococcal meningitis has a high case fatality rate (36%\u201366%) in the African meningitis belt, requires longer treatment than meningococcal meningitis, and is more frequently associated with severe sequelae.Diagnosis of bacterial meningitis typically requires lumbar puncture. In the absence of lumbar puncture, diagnosis can only be suspected through clinical examination (but not confirmed, except with a positive blood culture). Culture and PCR are confirmatory tests for bacterial meningitis. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) can support the diagnosis but are not confirmatory. Identification of serotypes or serogroups and susceptibility to antibiotics are important to define control measures. Molecular typing and whole genome sequencing can identify additional differences between strains and inform public health responses.A range of antibiotics is used to treat meningitis, including penicillin, ampicillin, and ceftriaxone. During epidemics of meningococcal and pneumococcal meningitis, ceftriaxone is the drug of choice. Nevertheless, pneumococcal resistance to antimicrobials is a serious and rapidly increasing problem worldwide.Two classes of pneumococcal vaccines are currently available. Conjugate vaccines are effective from six weeks of age at preventing meningitis and other severe pneumococcal infections and are recommended for infants and children up to the age of five years, and in some countries for adults aged over 65 years, as well as individuals from certain risk groups. Two different conjugate vaccines are in use that protects against 10 and 13 serotypes, respectively. New conjugate vaccines designed to protect against more pneumococcal serotypes are either in development or have been approved for use in adults. Conjugate vaccines are also effective in preventing nasopharyngeal carriage. A polysaccharide vaccine against 23 serotypes is available but, as for other polysaccharide vaccines, this type of vaccine is considered less effective than conjugate vaccines. It is used mostly in those aged over 65 years to protect against pneumonia, as well as in individuals from certain risk groups. It is not used in children under two years of age and is less useful in protecting against meningitis.",
        "Public Health Response": "An incident management system has been established to coordinate the outbreak response activities, and coordination meetings are held weekly. The national outbreak response plan has been developed and validated. Under the leadership of WHO, cross-border meetings are ongoing with Benin and Ghana to share information about outbreak response activities and strengthen preparedness and readiness.Health facility managers, community health workers, community relay agents (social workers) and community leaders are being trained on meningitis. Radio spots are broadcasted regarding community-based surveillance and the importance of early healthcare-seeking. Active case finding is being conducted in health facilities and in the community. Outbreak situation reports are developed by the Ministry of Health with the support of WHO and disseminated to stakeholders involved in response activities.WHO has procured and distributed cerebrospinal fluid sample collection and transportation materials to the health facilities in the affected areas. WHO is supporting the shipment of antibiotics (ceftriaxone) to improve case management. There are ongoing efforts to facilitate the shipment of the samples for further serotyping at the regional reference laboratory. WHO is also supporting the mobilization of resources for the implementation of the response plan.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Togo is part of the African meningitis belt and annually records meningitis cases and deaths. Although the country has experience in the management of meningococcal meningitis outbreaks over the past years, the current Streptococcus pneumoniae outbreak is unusual as the country has never managed a pneumococcal meningitis outbreak in the past, and national capacity is limited.\u00a0 To date, no imported cases have been reported in neighbouring countries. However, several factors are likely to increase the risk of spread, including the country's location in the African meningitis belt; the epidemic season, which typically runs from January to June; constraints in the provision of vaccination services, which do not allow for optimal vaccination coverage to protect the population; the fact that the main age groups affected by the outbreak are not protected by the routine vaccination against Streptococcus pneumoniae introduced in Togo in 2014; the security crisis in the Sahel, affecting the Savanes region, hampering public health interventions and causing population movements; the precarious economic conditions in the country, particularly in the Savanes region; and the suboptimal surveillance capacity for early case detection, diagnosis and treatment in the Oti Sud district.\u00a0Neighbouring countries are also in the African meningitis belt, and the Oti Sud district borders Ghana and Benin, making it possible for the disease to spread to other countries in the region.Considering the above-described situation, WHO assesses the overall risk posed by this outbreak as high at the national level, moderate at the regional level, and low at the global level.",
        "WHO Advice": "Early diagnosis and appropriate case management are essential, given the high case fatality and risk of developing sequelae due to pneumococcal meningitis. Prompt antibiotic treatment should be ensured for a duration of 10-14 days. Active community-based case-finding and community engagement should be implemented to inform the communities of the signs of meningitis and the importance of early diagnosis and treatment. The collection of detailed epidemiological and microbiological data, including serotyping, is essential to inform the pneumococcal meningitis control strategy.Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines are effective in preventing meningitis and other serious pneumococcal infections. To date, the available data do not support recommendations for reactive vaccination campaigns against pneumococcal meningitis outbreaks. Recommendations for the use of pneumococcal vaccine in community outbreak settings were discussed by the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) in October 2020, with one main conclusion being that more research and evidence gathering was needed from countries of the African meningitis belt, in order to develop a strategy for pneumococcal meningitis outbreak prevention and response.WHO, with the support of many partners, has developed a Global Roadmap to defeat meningitis by 2030. Concerted actions to achieve this goal are organized around five interrelated pillars:Prevention and epidemic control by developing new affordable vaccines, achieving high immunization coverage, improving prevention strategies, and responding to epidemics;Diagnosis and treatment through rapid confirmation of meningitis cases and optimal patient management;Meningitis surveillance to guide prevention and control;Management of those affected by meningitis through early case detection and improved access to management of complications; andAdvocacy and engagement to ensure high awareness of meningitis, promote country commitment and affirm the right to prevention, care, and follow-up services.Based on the information currently available on this outbreak, WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions for Togo.",

        "Outbreak name": "Human infection caused by Avian Influenza A (H5)",
        "Date Reported": "6 April 2023",
        "Location": "Chile",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 29 March 2023, the Ministry of Health of Chile notified WHO of a laboratory-confirmed case of human infection caused by avian influenza A(H5) virus in the Region of Antofagasta. This is the first human infection with avian influenza A(H5) virus reported in Chile and the third reported in the Region of the Americas to date. This is a single human infection, and no further case has been identified so far. An outbreak investigation is ongoing including determining the exposure of the case to the virus. In recent months of 2023, unprecedented outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) in animals have been reported from Chile. Avian Influenza A(H5N1) viruses have been detected among backyard poultry, farm poultry, wild birds, and sea mammals.\nAvian influenza infection in a human can cause severe disease and is notifiable under the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005)[1].",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 29 March 2023, the Ministry of Health of Chile notified WHO of the detection of human infection with avian influenza A(H5) virus, confirmed by the Institute of Public Health of Chile (ISP per its acronym in Spanish), which is the National Influenza Centre. The patient is a 53-year-old male from the Region of Antofagasta in the north of Chile. He had no history of comorbidities or recent travel.On 13 March 2023, he developed symptoms including cough, sore throat, and hoarseness. On 21 March, due to worsening symptoms, he sought care at a local hospital. On 22 March 2023, the case developed dyspnea and was admitted to a Regional Hospital at Antofagasta. A nasopharyngeal swab sample was collected as part of routine severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) surveillance and tested negative for COVID-19 by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). On 23 March, he was admitted to the intensive care unit. On 24 March, treatment with antivirals (oseltamivir) and antibiotics was initiated. He remains in respiratory isolation under multidisciplinary management, with mechanical ventilation due to pneumonia.\u00a0\u00a0On 27 March, a bronchoalveolar sample was collected and tested positive for an unsubtypeable influenza A virus by RT-PCR. The sample was sent to the ISP and tested positive for avian influenza A(H5) on 29 March. The neuraminidase type is yet to be confirmed and the clade information for the avian influenza A(H5) virus detected in this human case is not yet known. The NIC has forwarded the patient's samples to a WHO Collaborating Centre for further characterization.\u00a0Three close contacts of the case were asymptomatic and tested negative for influenza and have concluded the monitoring period. Additionally, a total of nine contacts among health care workers were identified, all concluded the monitoring on 4 April, however on 5 April one of them developed respiratory symptoms, therefore, further testing is ongoing, and the period of monitoring was extended for 7 more days for this contact of the case. Avian influenza A (H5N1) was first detected in the Americas in birds in December 2014. Between December 2022 and February 2023, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) was detected in wild aquatic birds (pelicans and penguins) and sea mammals (sea lions) in the Antofagasta Region where the case resides. According to preliminary findings of the epidemiological investigation of this human case, the most plausible route of transmission was through environmental exposure in areas close to the residence of the case where either sick or dead sea mammals or wild birds were found.",
        "Epidemiology": "Zoonotic influenza infections in humans may range from asymptomatic or mild upper respiratory infection (fever and cough) to rapid progression to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, shock, and death, depending on factors related to the virus and the host. Rarely, gastrointestinal, or neurological symptoms have been reported. Human cases of avian influenza are usually the result of direct or indirect exposure to infected live or dead poultry or contaminated environments.In the Region of the Americas during 2022 and 2023, an increasing number of outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5) have been reported in backyard poultry, farm poultry, wild birds, and wild mammals. Since the first confirmation of avian influenza A(H5N1) in the region in 2014, three human infections caused by avian influenza A(H5) have been reported: the first in the United States of America, reported in April 2022; the second in Ecuador, reported in January 2023; and this case. Globally, since 2003, 873 human infections, including 458 deaths (CFR 52%), with A(H5N1) viruses have been reported to WHO. Additionally, three human infections with influenza A (H5[2]) viruses, 84 human cases of infection with A(H5N6) viruses, and seven human cases of infection with A(H5N8) viruses have been reported to WHO.",
        "Public Health Response": "Local authorities are carrying out an epidemiological investigation and conducting contact tracing amongst family members and healthcare workers.\u00a0Intersectoral activities have been carried out by the Ministry of Health of Chile, the Agriculture and Livestock Service of the Ministry of Agriculture of Chile, and the National Fisheries and Aquaculture Service of Chile, among others, in order to follow up on the avian influenza outbreaks in the area.\u00a0\u00a0Active follow-up is being conducted of persons with respiratory symptoms and exposure to wild birds, poultry, and mammals; as well as cases with suspected influenza due to contact with poultry or who have been exposed to birds. Seasonal influenza vaccination is being conducted in risk groups according to the guidelines of the National Immunization Program.\u00a0The population has been informed, through messaging for different target audiences, about the case and about prevention measures.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "According to the preliminary findings of the local epidemiological investigation, the most plausible hypothesis about transmission is that it occurred through environmental exposure to areas where either sick or dead birds or sea mammals were found close to the residence of the case. According to the information received thus far, the virus has not been detected in other individuals.Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, wild birds or mammals, there is a risk for sporadic infection and small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected animals or contaminated environments.Public health measures have been implemented by both the human and animal health agencies, including monitoring healthcare workers and other contacts of the laboratory-confirmed case. While further characterization of the virus from this human case is pending, currently available epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that A(H5) viruses have not acquired the capacity for sustained transmission among humans, thus the likelihood of human-to-human spread is low. Based on available information, WHO assesses the risk to the general population posed by this virus to be low. Should infected individuals from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during travel or after arrival. If this were to occur, further community-level spread is considered unlikely as this virus has not acquired the ability to transmit easily among humans.The preliminary risk assessment will be reviewed as needed should further epidemiological or virological information become available.",
        "WHO Advice": "Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, and the large outbreaks among animal populations, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect and monitor virological, epidemiological, and clinical changes associated with emerging or circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health, and of timely virus sharing for risk assessment. The diversity of zoonotic influenza viruses that have caused human infections is alarming and necessitates strengthened surveillance in both animal and human populations, thorough investigation of every zoonotic infection, and pandemic preparedness planning. Vaccination of poultry workers with seasonal influenza vaccine has been advised to prevent a viral mutation that could facilitate human-to-human transmission. WHO does not advise special traveler screening at points of entry. \u00a0In the case of a confirmed or suspected human infection (even while awaiting the confirmatory laboratory results) with a novel influenza virus with pandemic potential, including avian influenza and variant viruses, contact tracing should be initiated and a thorough epidemiologic investigation of history of exposure to animals and of travel should be conducted. The epidemiologic investigation should include early identification of unusual clusters of respiratory events that could signal person-to-person transmission of the novel virus, and clinical samples collected from the time and place that the case occurred should be tested and then sent to a WHO Collaborating Centre for further characterization.There are no approved vaccines for preventing influenza A(H5) in humans. Candidate vaccine viruses to prevent influenza A(H5) infection in humans have been developed for pandemic preparedness purposes.Given the observed extent and frequency of avian influenza cases in wild birds and some wild mammals, the public should avoid contact with animals that are sick or dead from unknown causes and should report the occurrence to the authorities. Travelers to countries with known outbreaks of animal influenza should avoid farms, contact with animals in live animal markets, entering areas where animals may be slaughtered, or contact with\u00a0any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with animal faeces or other body fluids. Travelers should also wash their hands often with soap and water and follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices. Close analysis of the epidemiological situation, further characterization of the most recent viruses found in humans and poultry, and serological investigations, are critical to assess risk and to adjust risk management measures in a timely manner.All human infections caused by a novel influenza subtype are notifiable under the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005), and States Parties to the IHR are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic. Evidence of illness is not required for this notification.",

        "Location": "European Region",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 7 March 2023, the National IHR Focal Point (NFP) for Germany notified WHO of five cases of iatrogenic botulism in individuals who underwent medical procedures with the injection of botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT/A) in health institutions in T\u00fcrkiye. As of 17 March 2023, a total of 71 cases were reported in four countries in the European Region, mainly linked to two hospitals in different locations in T\u00fcrkiye.\nThe products used for the treatment were seized and taken for examination and evaluation by the Turkish Medicines and Medical Devices Agency. No new symptomatic cases have been reported since 8 March 2023.\nOutbreaks of botulism are very rare and can be associated with a natural, accidental, or potentially deliberate source of infection.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 7 March 2023, the National IHR Focal Point (NFP) for Germany notified WHO of five cases of iatrogenic botulism in individuals who underwent medical procedures with the injection of botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT/A) in health institutions in T\u00fcrkiye.\u00a0 As of 17 March 2023, a total of 71 clinical botulism cases were reported from T\u00fcrkiye (53 cases), Germany (16 cases), Austria (one case) and Switzerland (one case) linked to the aforementioned medical interventions performed in T\u00fcrkiye between 22 February and 1 March 2023.All cases are adults; most cases are middle-aged women. Among the 69 cases for which treatment location information is known, two private hospitals in two locations in T\u00fcrkiye were identified, with 66 cases linked to one hospital and three cases to another hospital.The clinical presentation of the cases ranged from mild to severe. Clinical signs of BoNT intoxication were observed (including fatigue, headache, blurred and/or double vision, dizziness, ptosis, dysphagia, dyspnea, neck weakness, generalized muscle weakness, and swollen tongue). Several cases were hospitalized. Some cases were treated with botulinum antitoxin. At least five cases were admitted to intensive care units. There are no reported deaths.Investigations carried out by Turkish authorities reported that licensed BoNT products were administered for a different purpose other than for which the products were approved (off-label use). The relevant departments of both hospitals had their activities suspended on 1 March 2023, and investigations have been launched against the parties involved.\u00a0 The products used for the treatment were seized and taken for examination and evaluation by the Turkish Medicines and Medical Devices Agency. No new symptomatic cases have been reported since 8 March 2023, which was the date of symptom onset for the last reported case.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "The Turkish Ministry of Health is working with the T\u00fcrkish Medicines and Medical Devices Agency and the Turkish National Poison Solidarity Center to investigate this event. The Turkish General Directorate of Public Health, Department of Communicable Diseases and Early Warning. is conducting an epidemiological investigation with provincial health centres and related departments. The relevant units of the Ministry of Health and the Turkish Police Service urgently inspected the two hospitals mentioned above. The investigation is currently ongoing to determine if the cause of the intoxication is due to product quality/safety, medical error, or an overdose.WHO is collaborating with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), and the affected IHR State Parties, regarding investigation, risk assessment, information sharing and response for this event.The Turkish Medicines and Medical Devices Agency published an announcement on its website on 10 March 2023. Similarly, the ECDC announced the current situation regarding this event in their publicly-available Communicable Disease Threats Report on 10 March 2023, and a news story was published on the ECDC website on 14 March 2023.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Botulinum neurotoxins are dangerous toxins produced by several species of the genus Clostridium (e.g.,\u00a0C. botulinum,\u00a0C. baratii,\u00a0C. butyricum, and\u00a0C. sporogenes) under anaerobic conditions. Botulinum neurotoxins are one of the most lethal substances known and occur in eight serotypes (A to H). Botulinum neurotoxins block nerve functions and can lead to muscular, including respiratory, paralysis. Human botulism is a naturally occurring rare disease and may refer to foodborne botulism, infant botulism, wound botulism, and inhalation botulism. Clostridium botulinum culture is used to produce pharmaceutical botulinum toxin-containing products. These pharmaceutical products employ the purified and heavily diluted botulinum neurotoxin (type A or type B, depending on the indication) injected for clinical use for the treatment of more than 20 neurological and non-neurological disorders, as well as for cosmetic use. Treatment is administered in the medical setting, tailored according to the needs of the patient and desired treatment effect. The symptoms of botulism can be very severe, requiring intensive-care treatment as well as the administration of specific anti-toxins. Even when such treatments are available, severe botulism cases require supportive treatment, including mechanical ventilation. Complete recovery usually takes weeks to months.This current event is possibly linked to a specific procedure and/or a medical product in at least two healthcare settings. Further investigations are ongoing regarding case ascertainment and notification. The investigation remains open for other possible hypotheses of intoxication. The respective departments in the two clinics where the procedures were undertaken have been closed since 1 March, with no further cases reported.There are several clinical indications for the use of botulinum neurotoxin; however, its off-label use in bariatric cases has increased in many countries. Depending on the product used, a warning of toxic effects may be insufficiently worded, and the risks not adequately addressed in the patient consent process.",
        "WHO Advice": "Botulism outbreaks are rare, but outbreaks require rapid recognition to identify the source of the disease, distinguish between types of outbreaks (natural, accidental or potentially deliberate), prevent additional cases, and effectively administer treatment to affected patients.Successful treatment depends significantly on early diagnosis and the rapid administration of the botulinum antitoxins. Iatrogenic botulism should be suspected if a patient has recently received botulinum neurotoxin, and clinicians should remain mindful of the risk of systemic botulism with BoNT therapy. The diagnostic detection of BoNT/A in patients suffering from iatrogenic botulism might be highly challenging due to the extremely low dose of toxin present and the potentially suboptimal timepoint of serum sampling. So far, very few detection methods have been shown to be validated on clinical specimens with a sensitivity better than the classical mouse bioassay, which is still regarded as a reference for BoNT detection in clinical samples. At this time, it cannot\u00a0be confirmed if the reported cases of botulism intoxication are due to product quality/safety, medical error, or an overdose.Although the source of the outbreak may have been removed, WHO Member States need to remain vigilant. It is therefore critically important for the IHR State Parties to identify any additional possible case, to establish the cause, and to determine if the product used in the procedure could be substandard or falsified. Investigation of these cases will assist in rapid containment at the disease source to prevent additional possible cases.WHO does not recommend any travel and/or trade restrictions to T\u00fcrkiye based on the information available for this event.",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 21 March 2023, the Ministry of Health (MoH) of the United Republic of Tanzania declared an outbreak of Marburg virus disease (MVD) in the country. As of 22 March, a total of eight cases, including five deaths (case fatality ratio [CFR]: 62.5%) have been reported from two villages in Bukoba district, Kagera region, United Republic of Tanzania. Two of these cases were healthcare workers, one of whom has died. This is the first Marburg virus disease outbreak reported in the country.\nAs response measures, Rapid Response Teams have been deployed to investigate and implement interventions in the affected areas, including contact tracing and risk communication activities. WHO assesses the risk of spread as very high at the national level, high at the subregional level, and moderate at the regional level due to cross-border movements between Kagera region and bordering countries including Uganda in the north, Rwanda and Burundi in the west. The risk at the global level is assessed to be low.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 16 March 2023, the MoH of the United Republic of Tanzania announced that seven cases and five deaths from an unknown disease had been reported in two villages in Bukoba district, Kagera region, northern Tanzania. The cases were later confirmed as Marburg virus infection by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at the National Public Health Laboratory, Tanzania. On 21 March 2023, the MoH officially declared the first MVD outbreak in the country. As of 22 March, eight cases, including five deaths (case fatality ratio [CFR]: 62.5%) have been reported from Kagera region. The remaining three patients are currently undergoing treatment. As of 22 March, no cases have been reported from outside the Bukoba district of Kagera Region. The first identified case reported travel history from Goziba Island in Lake Victoria in Tanzania and developed symptoms after returning to his village in Bukoba. The case died in the community. Four additional cases were identified from the same family as this index case. Further, two cases were reported among healthcare workers who treated them, one of whom died. No information is available on the eighth case; investigations are ongoing. Reported symptoms of the patients were fever, diarrhoea, vomiting, bleeding from various sites, and kidney failure. Samples from both deceased and live cases were taken and confirmed for Marburg virus by the National Public Health Laboratory.",
        "Epidemiology": "Marburg virus disease is an epidemic-prone disease associated with high case-fatality rates (CFR 24-90%). It is caused by the same family of viruses (Filoviridae) as Ebola virus disease and is clinically similar. The current CFR for this outbreak is relatively high, at 62.5%.Marburg virus infection often results from prolonged exposure to mines or caves inhabited by\u00a0Rousettus\u00a0bat colonies. Once an individual is infected with the virus, it can spread through human-to-human transmission via direct contact with the blood, secretions or other body fluids of infected or deceased people. Healthcare workers have previously been infected while treating patients with suspected or confirmed MVD. Burial ceremonies that involve direct contact with the body of the deceased can also contribute to the transmission of Marburg.The incubation period varies from two to 21 days. Illness caused by Marburg virus begins abruptly, with high fever, severe headache, and severe malaise. Severe watery diarrhoea, abdominal pain and cramping, nausea, and vomiting can begin around the third day. Severe haemorrhagic manifestations may appear between five and seven days from symptom onset, and fatal cases usually have some form of bleeding, often from multiple areas. In fatal cases, death occurs most often between eight and nine days after symptom onset, usually preceded by severe blood loss and shock.Clinical diagnosis of MVD is difficult in the early phase as symptoms are similar to other febrile illnesses. The differential diagnosis for MVD may include other filovirus diseases, Lassa fever, malaria, typhoid fever, dengue, rickettsial infections, leptospirosis and plague.Laboratory confirmation is primarily made by RT-PCR. Other tests can be used such as antibody-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), antigen-capture detection tests, serum neutralization tests, electron microscopy, and virus isolation by cell culture.Although there are no vaccines or antiviral treatments for MVD, supportive care \u2013 such as rehydration with oral or intravenous fluids \u2013 and treatment of specific symptoms improve survival. A range of potential treatments are being evaluated, including blood products, immune therapies, and drug therapies.This is the first time that Tanzania has reported an outbreak of MVD. Even though there is an ongoing outbreak of MVD in Equatorial Guinea (for more details, please see the\u00a0Disease outbreak news published on 22 March), so far there is no evidence of an epidemiological link between the two outbreaks. Other MVD outbreaks have been previously reported in Ghana (2022), Guinea (2021), Uganda (2017, 2014, 2012, 2007), Angola (2004-2005), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (1998 and 2000), Kenya (1990, 1987, 1980) and South Africa (1975).",
        "Public Health Response": "Regional and district-level Rapid Response Teams have been deployed to investigate and implement response measures. Contact tracing activities have been implemented to monitor people with similar symptoms in the community and at health facilities, including contacts of the known cases. A total of 161 contacts have been identified and 140 have been followed up and monitored by health professionals on 21 March. Risk communication activities have also been initiated in the Kagera Region to provide health awareness education and prevention messages.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "The United Republic of Tanzania has reported its first outbreak of MVD, which is a highly virulent disease, with a fatality ratio of up to 90%. The affected region, Kagera, borders three countries (Uganda to the north, and Rwanda and Burundi to the west) and Lake Victoria, and cross-border population movements may increase the risk of disease spread. In addition, Marburg virus has been isolated from fruit bats (Roussettus aegyptiacus) in Tanzania and countries neighboring the affected Kagera region, therefore, the same bat species may carry the virus in this region. Due to the high CFR and existing risk of spread of the outbreak to other areas of the country, inadequate human, financial and material resources to implement response interventions, and the likelihood of existing capacities being overwhelmed if the cases increase, the risk at the national level is assessed as very high.  Following the recent Ebola virus outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo from 23 April - 3 July 2022 and from 21 August - 27 September 2022, and Sudan ebolavirus outbreak in Uganda from 20 September 2022 to 11 January 2023, neighbouring countries in the subregion, including the United Republic of Tanzania, have been building preparedness capacities against filovirus diseases. In the West African region, an outbreak of MVD was declared on 13 February 2023 in Equatorial Guinea and is ongoing.  Based on the available information, the risk is considered as high at the subregional level, moderate at the regional level and low at the global level.",
        "WHO Advice": "Human-to-human transmission of Marburg virus is primarily associated with direct contact with the blood and/or other bodily fluids of infected people. Marburg virus transmission associated with health care services has been reported in previous outbreaks when appropriate infection control measures were not or were inadequately implemented.Healthcare workers caring for patients with confirmed or suspected MVD should apply additional infection prevention and control \u00a0measures in addition to standard precautions, to avoid contact with patients' blood and other body fluids and with contaminated surfaces and objects.Surveillance and detection activities, including contact tracing and active case finding, should be strengthened in all affected health zones. Measures to contain outbreaks of MVD include prompt safe and dignified burial of the deceased, identification of people who may have been in contact with someone infected with Marburg virus and monitoring their condition for 21 days, separation of healthy and sick people to prevent further transmission and care for confirmed patients, and maintenance of good hygiene and a clean environment.Raising awareness of the risk factors for Marburg infection and the protective measures that individuals can take to reduce human exposure to the virus are key measures to reduce human infections and deaths.WHO encourages all countries to ship samples (positive or negative) to a WHO Collaborating Center for confirmation.Based on the current risk assessment, WHO advises against any travel and trade restrictions with the United Republic of Tanzania.",

        "Outbreak name": "Avian Influenza A H5N1",
        "Date Reported": "30 May 2023",
        "Location": "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "In mid-May, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) the detection of avian influenza A(H5) virus in a poultry worker at a farm in England where poultry was infected with high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) viruses. Another detection was reported in a second individual performing culling operations on the farm. Both detections were later confirmed by additional testing as A(H5N1). Both cases were asymptomatic and detected as part of an ongoing enhanced surveillance study of asymptomatic workers exposed to poultry infected with avian influenza.\nAll the workers at this farm and their contacts have been identified; none of the contacts have reported symptoms, and no other influenza cases have been identified. The United Kingdom Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has not detected evidence of human-to-human transmission.\nBased on the available information, WHO considers these as sporadic detections of avian influenza viruses among humans with no evidence of person-to-person transmission to date. Thus, the likelihood of international disease spread through humans is considered to be low.\nGiven the widespread circulation in birds and the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO stresses the importance of global surveillance to detect virological, epidemiological and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses which may affect human (or animal) health.",
        "Description of the Situation": "In late April, the UKHSA was notified by the Animal and Plant Health Protection Agency (APHA) of an outbreak of HPAI (H5N1) on a poultry farm in England, United Kingdom. The human cases were detected through an ongoing\u00a0enhanced surveillance study of asymptomatic workers exposed to poultry infected with avian influenza.The UKHSA Rapid Investigation Team were deployed to the farm in early May 2023 to recruit exposed participants for the study. Of the 24 eligible persons, one tested positive for influenza A (with no detection of human seasonal subtypes H1 or H3) on the first sample self-taken at the premises. Two further nasopharyngeal samples collected from the same person tested negative for influenza A by a UKHSA regional laboratory and by the UKHSA national influenza reference laboratory. The participant remained clinically asymptomatic throughout.An update from the United Kingdom authorities to WHO in mid-May 2023, notified of an additional case from the same farm as influenza A(H5) positive on two separate samples. This second person was a poultry culler exposed to infected birds at the same farm. The poultry culler worked on the farm in early May using personal protective equipment (PPE). The case was clinically assessed and remains asymptomatic. The case was treated with oseltamivir and was negative on respiratory sampling taken on the last day of isolation.Sequencing later confirmed the virus detected in both individuals as A(H5N1). All samples from these two individuals were negative for seasonal influenza viruses. All other study participants remain well and have tested negative for influenza A on their samples to date. Follow-up of contacts has been completed. The affected farm is one of the first recruited in the ongoing enhanced surveillance study of asymptomatic workers exposed to poultry infected with avian influenza.Work to determine whether these are infections or not (i.e., could instead be due to transient mucosal contamination of the nose with virus particles) is underway, though it may be difficult to reach a conclusion.",
        "Epidemiology": "Animal influenza viruses normally circulate in animals but can also infect humans. Infections in humans have primarily been acquired through direct contact with infected animals or contaminated environments.\u00a0Depending on the host type, influenza A viruses can be classified as avian influenza, swine influenza, or other types of animal influenza viruses.Avian, swine, and other animal influenza virus infections in humans may cause disease ranging from mild upper respiratory tract infection to more severe disease and may be fatal. Conjunctivitis, gastrointestinal symptoms, encephalitis and encephalopathy have also been reported.Laboratory tests are required to diagnose human infection with influenza. WHO periodically updates technical guidance protocols for the detection of zoonotic influenza using molecular methods, e.g. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Evidence suggests that some antiviral drugs, notably neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir), can reduce the duration of viral replication and improve prospects of survival in some cases.In 2023, Europe has been experiencing a large epidemic of A(H5N1) viruses in birds, with outbreaks reported in domestic birds, wild birds, and mammals across 24 countries. Outbreaks in wild and domestic birds continue to be reported through May 2023.",
        "Public Health Response": "The United Kingdom implemented the following public health measures: Coordination and response: Since late April 2023, the standard measures for control of avian influenza in England were applied in the affected poultry farm. Situational assessment and response to human detection was coordinated by UKHSA and Public Health Scotland and undertaken by local health protection and National Health Service clinical services.Surveillance: A follow-up response including passive and active surveillance of exposed workers was undertaken for the first detection. For the second detected case, close contacts were offered chemoprophylaxis, swabbing, and were requested to self-isolate for ten days since their last exposure, reporting information about their health conditions. This second case was isolated until the negative swab result.Laboratory: Further samples have been obtained from the second case for analysis in a reference laboratory in Scotland. Virus characterization and genomic analysis are in process by the Respiratory Virus Unit, UKHSA/Scottish reference laboratory.Infection prevention and control: In the affected farms, measures related to the control of the outbreak have been undertaken, including on-site slaughter of the birds, the destruction of contaminated materials that could carry the virus, and cleaning and disinfection of the facilities. All participants involved in the culling process wore personal protective equipment. As per standard practice for confirmed infected poultry premises in the United Kingdom, a ten-kilometre surveillance zone, and a three-kilometre protection zone were declared by the United Kingdom Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs around the infected premises. The zone will remain in place for at least 21 days after preliminary cleansing and disinfection completion. It will not be lifted until surveillance activities, including clinical inspections of all commercial premises in the zone, have been undertaken.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "The two reported individuals with influenza A(H5N1) detection in their samples have remained asymptomatic and tested negative for influenza in their most recent samples to date. Their close contacts were asymptomatic and the follow-up period has been completed.Both cases were detected as part of an ongoing enhanced surveillance study of asymptomatic workers exposed to poultry infected with avian influenza. In these cases, detections may have resulted from either transient respiratory tract contamination (with no virus replication) or asymptomatic infection. Further testing (e.g., serology) is needed to confirm infection.Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in birds, humans who are exposed to these birds or their environments are at risk of infection.Sporadic human cases and transient contaminations of humans are rare, but not unexpected in such contexts. Thus far, there is no evidence of person-to-person transmission in this incident.\u00a0Although both reported cases were asymptomatic in this instance, previous A(H5N1) infections have resulted in severe infections in humans.Based on the available information, WHO assesses that the risk for the general population posed by this virus is low, and for occupationally exposed persons it is low to moderate.",
        "WHO Advice": "The reports of these events do not change the current WHO recommendations on public health measures and surveillance of influenza.\u00a0Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, and their widespread circulation in birds, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect and monitor virological, epidemiological, and clinical changes associated with emerging or circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal birds and mammals) health and timely virus sharing for risk assessment.When avian influenza viruses are circulating in an area, people involved in high-risk activities such as sampling infected birds or non-human mammals, culling, and disposing of infected animals, eggs, litters, and cleaning of contaminated premises should be trained on the proper use of and provided with appropriate PPE. All persons involved in these tasks should be registered and monitored closely by local health authorities for at least seven days following the last day of contact with infected animals or their environments. Those who develop respiratory symptoms should be rapidly sampled. Testing of asymptomatic exposed individuals could also be considered on a case-by-case basis, depending on available resources and objectives.In the case of a confirmed or suspected human infection caused by a novel influenza virus with pandemic potential, including a variant virus (infection with a swine influenza A virus), a thorough epidemiologic investigation (even while awaiting the confirmatory laboratory results) of history of exposure to animals, of travel, and contact tracing should be conducted. The epidemiologic investigation should include early identification of unusual respiratory events that could signal person-to-person transmission of the novel virus.\u00a0Clinical specimens collected from the case should be tested and sent to a WHO Collaboration Centre for further characterization.\u00a0WHO recommends that all people involved in work with poultry or birds should have a seasonal influenza vaccination to reduce the risk of potential recombination events.Travellers to countries with known outbreaks of animal influenza should avoid farms, contact with animals in live animal markets, entering areas where animals may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with animal faeces.\u00a0General precautions include regular hand washing and following good food safety and good food hygiene practices. Should infected individuals from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during travel or after arrival. If this were to occur, further community-level spread is considered unlikely as this virus has not acquired the ability to transmit easily among humans.\u00a0All human infections caused by a novel influenza subtype are notifiable under the International Health Regulations (IHR) and State Parties to the IHR (2005) are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic. Evidence of illness is not required for this report.WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel and/or trade for the United Kingdom based on available information on this event.",

        "Location": "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "This Disease Outbreak News was first published on 16 May 2023 and later updated on 17 May 2023 to correct the number of cases, deaths, and the number of cases with PCR testing.\nOn 5 April 2023, the National IHR Focal Point for the United Kingdom informed WHO of an increase in severe myocarditis in neonates associated with enterovirus infection in Wales. Between June 2022 and April 2023, ten hospitalised neonates with a positive enterovirus Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test were found to have myocarditis. Seven of the ten cases had further subtyping, with either coxsackie B3 or coxsackie B4 identified. As of 5 May 2023, one patient was still hospitalised, and one had died.\nAlthough enterovirus infections are common in neonates and young infants, the reported increase in myocarditis with severe outcomes in neonates and infants associated with enterovirus infection is unusual.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 5 April 2023, the National IHR Focal Point for the United Kingdom informed WHO of an increase in severe myocarditis in neonates and infants associated with enterovirus infection in Wales.Between June 2022 and April 2023, ten neonates, under 28 days of age, presented with a picture consistent with\u00a0 myocarditis and a positive enterovirus PCR. Seven cases were treated in intensive care, and one case died before transfer to tertiary care. Cases presented with features of sepsis, myocarditis, or in cardiorespiratory arrest. The peak incidence of cases was in November 2022, with sporadic cases in other months.Enterovirus PCR testing of all ten cases (with either blood, throat swab, nose swab, nasopharyngeal aspirate or cerebrospinal fluid samples) confirmed the presence of an enterovirus, subtyping (where available) to either coxsackie B3 or coxsackie B4. Critical care support including intubation, ventilation and circulatory support was given to the patients who went to intensive care.As of 5 May 2023, one patient was still hospitalised and one had died.The reported increase in severe myocarditis in neonates and infants associated with enterovirus infection is unusual. In the tertiary hospital covering the South Wales region, two other similar cases have been identified in the 6 years prior to June 2022.A further five cases have been identified over the same period in the Southwest of England. No additional information is currently available about these cases. Details of five of the cases from South Wales and three of the additional cases from Southwest England have recently been published (Ng et al., 2023).",
        "Epidemiology": "Myocarditis is an inflammation of the heart muscle (myocardium). The most common cause of myocarditis is viral infection (e.g., Enteroviruses), but it can also be caused by a bacterial infection, a reaction to a drug or an autoimmune disease. Myocarditis symptoms include new and persistent chest pain, shortness of breath and heart palpitations (racing or pounding heartbeat).Enteroviruses can cause a number of infectious illnesses and are responsible for annual epidemics. These are usually mild but have been found to affect neonates differently, and often more severely, than older children. There are multiple transmission routes, particularly in the neonatal period. The reported incident represents an increase in both the number and severity of enterovirus (coxsackieviruses) infections in infants under the age of one month. There is increased morbidity and mortality associated with the current incident.",
        "Public Health Response": "On 28 February 2023,\npediatricians in the South Wales region were alerted about the recent cases,\nwith advice to consider myocarditis in infants and neonates presenting in\nshock. A briefing note to clinicians, microbiologists, health boards and public\nhealth teams was sent from Public Health Wales on 3 May 2023, following an\nincident meeting in Wales on 26 April 2023.An Incident Management Team set\nup by the United Kingdom authorities are reviewing the evidence from all\nEnglish Regions and United Kingdom countries and agree on the next steps for\nresponse. Epidemiological investigations are ongoing.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "According to the authorities of\nthe United Kingdom, a review of past data from the previous six years from the\nsame tertiary care centre in Wales, United Kingdom, has identified only two\nsimilar cases prior to June 2022 (which may or may not be linked to the current\nincident).Based on the limited information\navailable at this point, WHO assesses the public health risk for the general population\nto be low. However, asymptomatic carriage and shedding of infectious virus is a\nfeature of enterovirus infection and there was little evidence in this case\nseries of maternal infection prior to or during delivery. As enterovirus\ninfection is often not among the notifiable diseases in Member States,\nadditional cases of severe, neonatal enterovirus infections might have gone\nundiagnosed and/or unreported elsewhere.",
        "WHO Advice": "Non-polio enteroviruses are common and distributed worldwide. Although infections often are asymptomatic, others present with mild to moderate respiratory tract infections. Symptoms include fever, runny nose and body weakness. These viruses are also associated with occasional outbreaks in which an unusually high proportion of patients develop clinical disease, sometimes with serious and fatal consequences \u2013 in this instance myocarditis. Clinicians seeing infants and neonates presenting in shock may consider a diagnosis of myocarditis and consider testing for enteroviruses.No specific antiviral therapy is available, and treatment focuses on prevention of complications. As there is no vaccine for this virus, control measures during outbreaks are focused on classical hygiene measures including frequent handwashing and disinfection of soiled clothing and surfaces. In certain situations, it may be advisable to close child-care facilities and schools to reduce the intensity of transmission.WHO does not recommend any travel and/or trade restrictions to United Kingdom based on the information available for this event.",

        "Date Reported": "8 May 2023",
        "Location": "Equatorial Guinea and the United Republic of Tanzania",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "Equatorial Guinea and the United Republic of Tanzania have been responding to separate outbreaks of Marburg virus disease (MVD) since early February and late March 2023, respectively.\nIn Equatorial Guinea, from 13 February to 1 May 2023, 17 laboratory-confirmed MVD cases and 23 probable cases have been reported. The last confirmed case was reported on 20 April. Among the laboratory-confirmed cases, there are 12 deaths (Case Fatality Ratio (CFR) 75%).For one confirmed case, the outcome is unknown. Among the confirmed cases, four have recovered. All of the probable cases are dead. The most affected district is Bata in Litoral province, with 11 laboratory-confirmed MVD cases reported.\nIn the United Republic of Tanzania, between 16 March to 30 April 2023, a cumulative total of nine cases including eight laboratory-confirmed cases and one probable case have been reported. The last confirmed case was reported on 11 April 2023. A total of six deaths (CFR 66.7%) have been reported, including one probable case and five among the confirmed cases. Among the confirmed cases, three have recovered. All cases have been reported from Bukoba district, Kagera region.\nHealth authorities in both countries have shown strong political commitment. In recent weeks they have further strengthened critical response functions, such as disease surveillance, including at points of entry; laboratory activities; clinical case management; infection prevention and control; risk communication and community engagement; and operations support and logistics with support of WHO and partners.\nWHO continues to monitor the situation in these two countries closely and to support the responses.",
        "Description of the Situation": "Equatorial Guinea:Since the declaration of the outbreak on 13 February 2023, a total of 17 laboratory-confirmed cases of MVD and 23 probable cases have been reported as of 1 May (Figure 1). Among laboratory-confirmed cases, 12 deaths were recorded (CFR 75%). For one confirmed case, the outcome of the illness is unknown. All probable cases are dead. Five districts (Bata, Ebebiyin, Evinayong, Nsok Nsomo and Nsork) in four of the country\u2019s eight provinces (Centro Sur, Ki\u00e9-Ntem, Litoral and Wele-Nzas) have reported confirmed or probable cases (Figure 2). The most affected district is Bata in Litoral province, with 11 laboratory-confirmed MVD cases reported.\u00a0Among the confirmed cases, four have recovered and five have been reported among healthcare workers, of whom two died.Among the reported cases, many are linked within a social network/gathering or by geographic proximity, however, the earlier presence of cases and/or clusters across multiple districts without clear epidemiologic links may indicate undetected virus transmission.There are currently no confirmed cases in the Marburg treatment centre following the most recent discharge of a patient on 26 April 2023. This brings the total of survivors to four since the outbreak was declared.\u00a0Figure 1. MVD cases by week of symptom onset* and case classification, Equatorial Guinea, between 13 February to 1 May 2023.Among MVD laboratory-confirmed cases with age and sex information (n = 16), the majority occurred among females (10/16; 62.5%), while the most affected age group is 40-49 years (6/16; 37.5%), followed by the age groups 30-39 years (3/16; 18.8%), 10-19 years (2/16; 12.5%), and 0-9 years (2/16; 12.5%).In the last 21 days (from 11 April to 1 May 2023), two confirmed cases were reported from Bata district (Figure 3). These cases had a known epidemiological link to a confirmed case, through a family cluster or through a healthcare setting.\u00a0Figure 2.

Among the total cases, six deaths were recorded (CFR 66.7%). Among the confirmed cases, three have recovered, and two have been reported among healthcare workers, one of whom died .In the last 21 days, from 10 to 30 April, one confirmed case was reported on 11 April.\u00a0 This case was the mother of a previously reported MVD case, a child of 18 months old, who died on the same day. The mother was quarantined as soon as MVD was detected in the child in March. No further contacts linked to this case have been reported. There are currently no confirmed cases in the treatment centre in Bukoba following the discharge of the confirmed patient on 21 April 2023. This brings the total of survivors to three since the outbreak was declared.Figure 4: Distribution of MVD cases (confirmed and probable) by date of symptom onset in the United Republic of Tanzania, as of 30 April 2023.\u00a0Figure 5: Map of district reporting MVD confirmed and probable cases in the United Republic of Tanzania, as of 30 April 2023.All cases are reported from Bukoba district in Kagera Region.\u00a0Cases ranged in age\u00a0 from 1 to 59 years old (median 35-year-old), with males being the most affected (n= 6; 66.7%).",
        "Epidemiology": "Marburg virus spreads between people via direct contact through broken skin or mucous membranes with the blood, secretions, organs, or other bodily fluids of infected people and with surfaces and materials such as bedding, and clothing contaminated with these fluids. Healthcare workers have previously been infected while treating patients with suspected or confirmed MVD. Burial ceremonies involving direct contact with the deceased's body can also contribute to the transmission of the Marburg virus.The incubation period varies from 2 to 21 days. Illness caused by the Marburg virus begins abruptly, with high fever, severe headache, and severe malaise. Severe haemorrhagic manifestations may appear between five and seven days from symptom onset. However, not all cases have haemorrhagic signs, and fatal cases usually have some form of bleeding, often from multiple areas.\u00a0Although no vaccines or antiviral treatments are approved to prevent or treat the virus, Remdesivir is being used on a modified, monitored emergency-use basis in Equatorial Guinea. Early supportive care \u2013 rehydration with oral or intravenous fluids \u2013 and treatment of specific symptoms and co-infections can improve survival. A range of potential treatments are being evaluated, including blood products, immune therapies, and drug therapies.\u00a0\u00a0This is the first reported outbreak of MVD in both Equatorial Guinea and the United Republic of Tanzania. Other MVD outbreaks have been previously reported in Ghana (2022), Guinea (2021), Uganda (2017, 2014, 2012, 2007), Angola (2004-2005), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (2000 and1998), Kenya (1990, 1987, 1980) and South Africa (1975).",

The checklist consists of several key components and an average score is calculated to provide readiness scores to each of the identified countries. A second round of readiness assessment across all pillars was conducted for Cameroon and Gabon. As of 3 May 2023, the sub-region's overall readiness capacity was evaluated at 66%.\u00a0\u2022 Based on the gaps identified during the assessments, a gap analysis was conducted and shared with Cameroon and Gabon to inform priority readiness activities. The identified gaps would be addressed through the optimization of operational capacities and capabilities using various strategies, including trainings, table-top exercises, and simulation exercises. Additionally, the deployment of experts would be employed to support the implementation of the readiness activities.In the United Republic of Tanzania:Coordination\u2022 The Ministry of Health holds daily response meetings to discuss the ongoing response activities. These meetings are attended by heads of pillars and partners\u00a0\u2022 Resource mobilization activities by the Ministry of Health, in collaboration and support from WHO and UNICEF, are ongoing\u2022 The MoH continue capacity building efforts for the regional response team .\u2022 Prevention of sexual misconduct activities are ongoing at the country level.

As of 3 May 2023, the overall readiness capacity for this sub-region was evaluated at 70%.\u2022 Based on the gaps identified during the assessments, a gap analysis was conducted and shared with the mentioned five countries to inform priority readiness activities. The identified gaps would be addressed through the optimization of operational capacities and capabilities using various strategies, including trainings, table-top exercises, and simulation exercises. Additionally, the deployment of experts would be employed to support the implementation of the readiness activities.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Both countries have reported MVD outbreaks for the first time.In Equatorial Guinea, while many cases are linked within a social network/gatherings or by geographic proximity, the earlier presence of cases and/or clusters across multiple districts without clear epidemiologic links may indicate undetected virus transmission. The last cases occurred in Bata, the most populated city and economic hub of Equatorial Guinea, with an airport and seaport, posing challenges for the response. The country surveillance system remains suboptimal, with few alerts reported. Additionally, there are population movements between the different districts of the mainland and island regions. Frequent population movements and porous land borders are also reported in the districts bordering Cameroon and Gabon, with suboptimal surveillance at land entry points and countless uncontrolled paths or trails along the border with Cameroon and Gabon.\u00a0In the United Republic of Tanzania, the affected region, Kagera, borders three countries (Uganda to the north, and Rwanda and Burundi to the west) and Lake Victoria, and cross-border population movements may increase the risk of disease spread. Following the recent Ebola virus outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo from 23 April - 3 July 2022 and from 21 August - 27 September 2022, and Sudan ebolavirus outbreak in Uganda from 20 September 2022 to 11 January 2023, neighbouring countries in the subregion, including the United Republic of Tanzania, have been building preparedness capacities against filovirus diseases.\u00a0 However, an epidemiological investigation, which is still being carried out,\u00a0 has not revealed the source of the outbreak\u00a0 which may pose an additional risk to the population in the affected district.\u00a0In March 2023, WHO assessed the public health risk posed by the MVD outbreaks in Equatorial Guinea and the United Republic of Tanzania as very high at the national level, high at the sub-regional level, moderate at the regional level, and low at the global level.\u00a0 WHO continues to monitor the situation in these two countries closely.",
        "WHO Advice": "MVD outbreak control relies on using a range of interventions, such as early isolation and optimized supportive care; surveillance including active case search, case investigation and contact tracing; an optimal laboratory service; infection prevention and control; safe and dignified burial; and social mobilization. Risk Communication and Community engagement is key to successfully controlling MVD outbreaks. Raising awareness of risk factors for infection with Marburg virus and the protective measures that individuals can take is an effective way to reduce human transmission.Health workers caring for patients with confirmed or suspected MVD should apply IPC measures including, standard and transmission-based precautions and wearing personal protective equipment and performing hand hygiene to avoid contact with the patient\u2019s blood and body fluids and with contaminated surfaces and objects. Health facilities should ensure environmental controls, such as adequate water, sanitation and hygiene, as well as that safe infectious waste management protocols are in place to enable health workers to practice IPC measures. In addition, healthcare facilities should conduct appropriate screening, isolation and referral of suspected cases. WHO recommends that male survivors of MVD practice safer sex for 12 months from onset of symptoms, or until their semen twice tests negative for the Marburg virus. WHO does not recommend isolation of male or female convalescent patients whose blood has tested negative for the Marburg virus.Based on the available information and current risk assessment, WHO advises to strengthen surveillance in the country through alert management, case investigation, contact listing, tracing and follow up and active case search. In addition, WHO advises to strengthen surveillance at points of entry in the affected areas in Equatorial Guinea and the United Republic of Tanzania for the identification of cases, including through exit screening; to map cross-border population mobility to identify populations in vulnerable situations and target public health interventions; and to provide public health information and advice in all relevant languages in affected districts, at points of entry and in adjacent communities near land borders. Furthermore, suspect, probable and confirmed cases and their contacts should not undertake travel, including international. Based on available information, WHO advises against any other international travel and/or trade measures in Equatorial Guinea and the United Republic of Tanzania. States Parties adopting international travel- and trade-related measures potentially more restrictive than those advised by WHO, are invited to report them to WHO, pursuant to Article 43 of the International Health Regulations (2005).Before initiating discussion on the 42-day countdown to declare the end of an outbreak, it is recommended that all listed contacts of confirmed or probable cases have completed their 21-day follow-up period with no symptoms. If not, there is still a possibility that a contact becomes a case.\u00a0Once all contacts have completed their 21-day period, the date of last possible exposure to a MVD probable or confirmed case can be set, based on two possible scenarios:\u00a0\u2022 The person was a confirmed positive case. He/she recovered and later tested negative by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on two blood samples collected at an interval of at least 48 hours. The 42-day count starts on the day after the day on which the second negative PCR sample was collected.\u2022 The person was a confirmed or probable MVD case. He/she died and a burial was organized. The 42-day count begins the day after the burial.",

        "Date Reported": "5 May 2023",
        "Location": "South Sudan",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 14 April 2023, the Ministry of Health (MoH) of South Sudan declared an outbreak of the hepatitis E Virus (HEV) in Wau city, the capital of Western Bahr el-Ghazal state and one of the largest cities in South Sudan. Between 23 March 2023 and 13 April 2023, a total of 91 HEV suspected cases have been reported from Wau, of which 35 are confirmed; there have been five deaths reported (case fatality ratio [CFR] 5.5%). A multidisciplinary national rapid response team has been deployed by the MoH, supported by WHO, to conduct an epidemiological investigation, determine the extent of the outbreak, identify exposures or risk factors to prevent further spread and implement appropriate preventive measures.\nHEV is transmitted by the fecal-oral route, mainly through contaminated water. Hepatitis E is found worldwide and is common in developing countries with inadequate water supply, limited access to adequate clean drinking water, poor environmental sanitation, personal hygiene, and limited health services, or areas of humanitarian emergencies.\nCases of the hepatitis E virus have been reported in the Bentiu camp for internally displaced persons (IDPs) in South Sudan since 2018, with seasonal upsurges reported yearly, particularly during the rainy season due to floods leading to contamination of drinking water. There is a risk of international spread of the disease as South Sudan shares borders with Sudan and Ethiopia, with substantial traffic between them. The situation is further aggravated by the highly mobile IDP and refugee population, mainly from Rubkona county, Unity State, where the Bentiu IDP camp is located.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 14 April 2023, the Ministry of Health of South Sudan declared an outbreak of the hepatitis E Virus in Wau city, the capital of Western Bahr el-Ghazal State.On 22 March 2023, the MoH was notified of a cluster of cases with jaundice and several deaths. In response, the MoH, supported by WHO, immediately deployed a multidisciplinary national rapid response team to conduct an epidemiological investigation, characterize the event, determine its magnitude, and identify exposures or risk factors to guide control and prevention measures.Between 23 March 2023 and 13 April 2023, a total of 91 suspected cases of hepatitis E virus were reported and five were fatal (CFR 5.5%). A total of 44 blood samples were collected and tested for HEV IgM antibodies, of which 79% (n = 35) were confirmed. Most cases (93%) have been reported from Nazareth village in Wau South. The median age of cases is 20 years (range 2 \u2013 71 years). Males are most affected, accounting for 74% of all reported cases.\u00a0\u00a0To validate the positive results, 24 samples were shipped to the Uganda Virus Research Institute\u00a0and Medical Research Council virology laboratory in Uganda on 17 April 2023. On 24 April 2023, ten of the 24 samples tested positive for HEV by real time\u00a0polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Further detailed investigation and sequencing of samples are ongoing.Hepatitis E Virus (HEV) cases have been consistently reported in South Sudan since 2018, with recurrent outbreaks in Bentiu, Rubkona county, in the Unity state (central-north part of South Sudan), where the Bentiu IDP camp with around 170 000 individuals is located.Between 2018 and 29 November 2021, a total of 1707 suspected cases, including 104 confirmed and 12 deaths (five deaths in 2021 alone) were reported in the country. All confirmed cases were tested by PCR at the Uganda Virus Research Institute.In 2022, 2110 cases were reported in Bentiu IDP camp, Unity state. Following the continued detection of cases in March, April, and October 2022, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) and the MoH jointly carried out the first hepatitis E vaccination campaign in Bentiu IDP camp. Around 25 000 people, including pregnant women, received the vaccine out of around 170 000 people in the camp.\u00a0As of 19 March 2023, 4009 cases of hepatitis E, including 27 deaths (CFR: 1%) have been reported from Bentiu IDP camp.",
        "Epidemiology": "Hepatitis E is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis E virus (HEV). Hepatitis E is found worldwide and is common in developing countries with limited access to adequate clean drinking water, poor sanitation and personal hygiene, limited health services or in areas of humanitarian emergencies.\u00a0The hepatitis E virus is transmitted by the fecal-oral route, mainly through contaminated water. The risk factors for hepatitis E are related to poor sanitation conditions, allowing the viruses excreted in the feces of infected subjects to reach water intended for human consumption. The infection resolves spontaneously in 2-6 weeks with a 0.5-4% lethality. Fulminant hepatitis, severe liver function impairment caused by HEV, is more common in pregnancy. Pregnant women, especially in their second and third trimesters, are at increased risk of acute liver failure, fetal loss, and mortality: the case-fatality rate can be as high as 20-25% in women in the last trimester of pregnancy.\u00a0Globally, most human infections with HEV are attributed to genotypes 1 and 2, which primarily affect humans in developing countries where contamination of drinking water and lack of adequate sanitation are common, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia.",
        "Public Health Response": "The\u00a0South Sudan MoH continues to work with WHO and partners to ensure response efforts are fully implemented and the people of South Sudan are protected from the risk of HEV.\u00a0The MoH has initiated the following key response actions: Leadership and coordinationThe\u00a0Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) Cluster at the state and national levels is tracking the progress of the response.\u00a0WASH partners in hotspot counties (Wau and Jur River) continue to focus on integrating with the Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) and Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE) pillars of the state MoH (SMoH) Taskforce. The WASH Cluster\u00a0at the state level has established twice-weekly meetings. WASH Cluster\u00a0sub-national coordinators attend SMoH Taskforce meetings to get updates and relay them to partners.\u00a0Immediate activation of the Public Health Emergency Operations Center and all response pillars: coordination, surveillance, case management, WASH, IPC, RCCE, safe and dignified burial, points of entry, and logistics.\u00a0WASHWherever required, WASH actors continue to provide technical guidance to health partners in implementing IPC in target health facilities and HEV treatment/isolation centres where the health partner does not have WASH capacity.\u00a0The\u00a0WASH Cluster at the state level is coordinating with health partners to identify affected households for the provision of WASH-related non-food items and hygiene promotion.Surveillance and case managementMaintaining the multi-disciplinary national rapid response team in Wau to continue supporting the SMoH and partners to mount a full-scale response in the areas of active case search and line listing of cases, additional sample collection and testing at the Wau Teaching Hospital and the National Public Health Laboratory, case management and IPC measures to health facilities, improving WASH conditions, and IPC in affected communities.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Cases of hepatitis E virus have been detected in South Sudan and the Bentiu IDP camp since 2018. If the WASH conditions are not improved, the potential risk to human health is high, especially for pregnant women and infants, as mother-to-infant transmission of HEV (during the third trimester of gestation) has been reported. \u00a0The risk at the national level is assessed as high due to:Poor sanitation and hygiene practices, especially in the IDP camp;Limited availability of safe drinking water; Poor access to essential medical services; The presence of a large IDP population in South Sudan; Financial constraints impacting capacities to effectively contain the outbreak and limited local capacity to carry out response activities effectively; The limited availability of vaccine supply; Population movements; High risk of death in pregnant women in the absence of HEV vaccine introduction; \u00a0The\u00a0overall risk at the regional level is considered moderate due to the risk of disease spread between the mobile IDP populations and refugees who cross the borders between South Sudan, Sudan, and Ethiopia. In 2018, genomic sequencing of isolates from HEV cases reported in Bentiu IDP camp showed HEV genotype 1, closely related to strains isolated in the Chad basin and Northern Uganda. This highlights the risk of extensive regional spread in the current context that involves IDPs, refugees, and other populations of humanitarian concern.\u202f\u00a0At the global level, the risk is low.",
        "WHO Advice": "Prevention is the most effective approach against this disease. At the community level, the most important interventions to reduce HEV transmission are\u00a0safe drinking water, quality standards for public water supplies, and adequate sanitation. At the individual level, infectious risks can be reduced by maintaining hygiene practices such as washing hands with clean water and soap,\u00a0especially before handling food, avoiding consumption of water and/or ice of unknown purity, and following WHO hygiene practices for food safety.\u00a0To prevent the spread of acute hepatitis E, WHO recommends improving access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation. The\u00a0drinking water quality should be regularly monitored in neighborhoods affected by this epidemic. Coverage of latrines and drinking water sources should be increased to prevent open defecation and to ensure hand hygiene. Health promotion and prevention activities, as well as ensuring early, appropriate, and equitable healthcare services to combat hepatitis E epidemics, can help improve public health outcomes, especially in resource-limited settings. Since the incubation period for hepatitis E ranges from two to 10 weeks, cases may continue to occur up to 10 weeks after measures to ensure safe water, sanitation, and hygiene promotion have been adopted.\u00a0Interventions must continue to target vulnerable populations by\u00a0establishing or strengthening antenatal diagnosis for pregnant women with symptoms, improving the population's hygiene conditions, strengthening national capacities for diagnosis and clinical case management, and cross-border collaboration with neighbouring countries.\u00a0There is no specific treatment for the clinical management of patients. There may be specific situations, such as outbreaks, where the risk of hepatitis E or its complications or mortality is particularly high. The recombinant hepatitis E vaccine, Hecolin, has been developed for commercialization and licensed in China and Pakistan. While WHO does not recommend the introduction of the vaccine as part of national routine population immunization programs, WHO recommends that national authorities consider using the vaccine in outbreak settings, including in populations at high risk, such as pregnant women.",

        "Date Reported": "4 May 2023",
        "Location": "Ethiopia",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "Measles is endemic in Ethiopia, with cases reported every year. Between 12 August 2021 and 1 May 2023, 16 814 laboratory-confirmed measles cases and 182 deaths \u2013 with a Case Fatality Ratio (CFR) of 1.1% - have been reported nationally.\nFrom 2021, the annual number of confirmed measles cases has increased significantly, from 1953 in 2021 to 9291(\u02c3375%) in 2022 and 6933 in 2023 as of 1 May. Thus, there was, an almost five-fold increase in confirmed measles cases between 2021 and 2022.\nLow population immunity, combined with concurrent epidemics, conflict, forced displacement, and other humanitarian crises that disrupt childhood vaccinations, are some factors that may explain the increases.\nMeasles is a highly contagious disease caused by measles virus and it is normally passed through direct contact and through the air. The virus infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body. It can lead to major epidemics with significant illness and death, especially among vulnerable people, such as young children. In 2022, 45% of all cases were children under 5 years of age.\nThere is no specific antiviral treatment for measles, but an effective and safe vaccine is available for prevention and control. A 95% population vaccination coverage is required to stop measles circulation.",
        "Description of the Situation": "Since 12 August 2021, all 13 Regional Health Bureaus in Ethiopia have received reports of suspected measles cases in either host communities, displaced populations, or refugees. Since then, and as of 1 May 2023, 16 814 laboratory-confirmed measles cases and 182 deaths, with a CFR of 1.1% have been reported nationally. From 2021, the annual number of confirmed measles cases has increased significantly, from 1953 in 2021 to 9291(+375%) in 2022, and 6933 so far in 2023 as of 1 May. Thus, there was, a nearly five-fold increase in confirmed measles cases between 2021 and 2022. There are active measles outbreaks reported in 44 woredas/districts from eight regions: Afar, Amhara, Harari, Oromia, Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples Region (SNNPR), South West Ethiopia Peoples\u2019 Region (SWEPR), Tigray and Somali. The number of measles-affected woredas was 52 (5% of the country\u2019s 1080 woredas) in 2021 and 125 (12%) in 2022.Between 1 January to 2 April 2023, the Somali region reported 56 laboratory-confirmed and 364 epidemiologically linked measles cases. In 2022, the nationwide measles incidence rate was 82 cases per one million population. The highest reported rates were in the Somali region, which reported 540 cases per one million population. The lack of reporting associated with the crisis in Northern Ethiopia (Tigray) hampers an adequate assessment of the measles situation.Amongst the confirmed measles cases, only 36% have received one dose or more of the measles-containing vaccine (MCV). According to WHO UNICEF Estimates of National Immunization Coverage (WUENIC) low population immunity (MCV1 and MCV2 coverage in 2021 was estimated at 54% and 46% respectively), combined with concurrent epidemics, conflict, forced displacement, and other humanitarian crises that disrupt childhood vaccinations, are some of the risk factors identified for the increased spread of the disease. Furthermore, cultural beliefs, insufficient awareness, and behavioral characteristics can be a barrier to seeking early treatment and making use of other management strategies for disease management.The country faces various challenges that could exacerbate the situation further, including high rates of malnutrition (nutritional screening during measles SIAs showed that 0.6% of children had severe acute malnutrition 4.7% had global acute malnutrition (GAM) based on over 15,000 children screened) and, a lack of access to health care in conflict-affected areas increasing the risk of severe disease, displacement and crowded conditions poor hygiene and sanitation access and practices increasing the risk of interpersonal spread. According to the latest predictions by the IGAD Climate Prediction and Applications Centre (ICPAC) and National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs) of the Greater Horn of Africa (GHA), Additionally, certain regions affected by drought, such as SNNPR, Oromia, Somali, Afar, and SWEPR, have also reported floods, and around 1.7 million people are at risk of flooding, according to preparedness plans, further risking displacement, disruption of vaccination, and a risk of having people move to crowded settlements increasing the risk of measles circulation.Figure 1.

Woredas reporting active measles outbreaks in Ethiopia from 12 August 2021 to 30 April 2023\u00a0Note: Active outbreak: Three or more measles IgM+ cases reported within one month. Controlled outbreak: No new case reported for the last 30 days after onset of the last case reported.",
        "Epidemiology": "Measles is caused by a virus in the paramyxovirus family. The virus infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body. Measles is a human disease and is not known to occur in animals. It can lead to major epidemics with significant morbidity and mortality, especially among vulnerable people. Among young and malnourished children, pregnant women, and immunocompromised individuals, including those with HIV, cancer or treated with immunosuppressives, measles can cause serious complications, including ear infection, severe diarrhoea, blindness, encephalitis, pneumonia, and death.Transmission is primarily person-to-person by airborne respiratory droplets that disperse rapidly when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Transmission can also occur through direct contact with infected secretions. Transmission from asymptomatic exposed immune persons has not been demonstrated. The virus remains active and contagious in the air or on infected surfaces for up to two hours. A patient is infectious from four days before the start of the characteristic morbilliform rash, to four or five days after its appearance. There is no specific antiviral treatment for measles; most people recover within 2-3 weeks.An effective and safe vaccine is available for prevention and control. The measles-containing vaccine\u2019s first dose (MCV1) is given at nine months, while the second dose of the measles-containing second dose (MCV2) is given at the age of 15 months. A 95% population coverage of MCV1 and MCV2 is required to stop measles circulation.In areas with low vaccination coverage, epidemics typically occur every two to three years and usually last between two and three months. However, their duration varies according to population size, crowding, and the population\u2019s immunity status.",
        "Public Health Response": "The following measures have been undertaken in the country to control the outbreak:Nationwide measles-preventive supplemental immunization activities (SIA) have been conducted from 22-31 December 2022, in all areas except those affected by conflict (all woredas in Tigray, 12 districts in Oromia, and seven in Benishangul Gumuz). A total of 14 579 818 under 5 children were vaccinated out of a target of 15 471 740 resulting in 94.2% coverage.Starting in February 2022, a catch-up measles vaccination campaign was launched, targeting children aged 9 to 23 months. This campaign was conducted in 55 woredas that are high-risk or have been affected by conflict in the Amhara, Oromia, SNNPR, and Somali Regions. The campaign was integrated with vitamin A supplementation and other routine immunization efforts.Support to improve case management, including capacity building and procurement for medications and supplies.Intensification of surveillance activities, including active case search by health extension workers, root cause analyses, and detailed investigations in affected woredas.Intensification of routine immunization through outreach servicesTraining for frontline respondersCommunity engagement and risk communication activities are being conducted through a locally tailored approach.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Measles is a highly contagious disease that occurs seasonally in endemic areas. Measles is still common in many developing countries, particularly in parts of Africa and Asia. Over 95% of measles deaths occur in countries with low per capita incomes and weak health infrastructures. Measles remains an important cause of death among young children globally, despite a safe and effective vaccine being available.There are several challenges that Ethiopia is facing in its efforts to increase national childhood vaccination coverage: conflict, population movement, and an insufficient stock of vaccines at the national level. These challenges are expected to fuel outbreaks and increase the number of cases. The overall risk at the national level is assessed as high due to the following factors:Active outbreaks as of 1 May 2023 in 44 woredas in 8 out of 13 regions:\u00a0 Afar, Amhara, Harari Oromia, SNNPR, SWEPR, Tigray, and Somali;Sub-optimal immunization coverage and low population immunity, Weak surveillance systems result in late detection of cases and inadequate outbreak investigations, especially at the community level. Furthermore, active surveillance is inconsistently implemented, likely resulting in under-reporting of cases and deaths;Poor health awareness in the affected community, resulting in inadequate health promotion and poor health-seeking behavior; Inadequate case management skills in handling complicated cases, further exacerbated by referral challenges associated with lack of transportation especially for patients from remote areas;Concurrent disease outbreaks (for example, cholera, pertussis, circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus) have limited the overall capacity and resources to respond to measles transmission;Concurrent complex humanitarian situations from widespread conflict, displacement, and severe and prolonged drought;Difficulty accessing and delivering supplies due to the poor road network and insecurity in western parts of Oromia, Benishangul Gumuz, Tigray, Afar, and Amhara;Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health system.At the regional level, the overall risk is assessed as moderate due to the following factors:Ongoing severe drought in the Horn of Africa;Ongoing population movement;Conflict and insecurity in multiple countries in the region;Weak cross-border surveillance;Vulnerability of health systems within the region;Ongoing outbreaks within neighboring countries and suboptimal vaccination coverage.The risk has been assessed as low at global level.",
        "WHO Advice": "The key public health strategies to reduce disease burden and transmission include routine vaccination of children against measles, combined with periodic intensification of routine immunization activities (PIRI) and mass immunization campaigns in countries with high morbidity and mortality rates. There is no specific treatment for measles. Case management of measles focuses on supportive care as well as the prevention and treatment of measles complications and secondary infections. Since measles is highly contagious, patient isolation is important to prevent the further spread of the virus.Oral rehydration salts should be used as needed to prevent dehydration. All children diagnosed with measles should receive two doses of vitamin A oral supplements, given 24 hours apart, irrespective of the timing of previous doses of vitamin A; 50 000 international units (IU) should be given to infants aged < 6 months, 100 000 IU to infants aged 6-11 months and 200 000 IU to children aged 12 months. This treatment restores low vitamin A levels in acute measles cases that occur even in well-nourished children and can help prevent eye damage and blindness. Vitamin A supplements have also been shown to reduce the number of measles deaths.Nutritional support is recommended to reduce the risk of malnutrition due to diarrhoea, vomiting and poor appetite associated with measles. Breastfeeding should be encouraged where appropriate.In unimmunized or insufficiently immunized individuals, the measles vaccine may be administered within 72 hours of exposure to the measles virus to protect against disease. If the disease does subsequently develop, symptoms are usually less severe, and the duration of illness may be shortened.WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel or trade to or from Ethiopia.",

        "Outbreak name": "Lassa fever",
        "Date Reported": "1 May 2023",
        "Location": "Nigeria",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "Nigeria is currently experiencing a large outbreak of Lassa fever, with 4702 suspected cases, five probable cases, and 877 confirmed cases between epidemiological weeks 1 and 15 of 2023 (week ending 16 April). Among confirmed cases, there have been 152 deaths (CFR 17%). Lassa fever is endemic in Nigeria and parts of West Africa where the multimammate rat, the main reservoir of the Lassa virus, is common.\nResponding to the current outbreak is challenging due to the need to respond to multiple emergencies simultaneously.\nThe symptoms of Lassa fever vary widely, and diagnosis can be difficult. Most cases (\u223c 80%) are asymptomatic or mild. Still, the infection can result in severe illness and multiple organ dysfunction with or without haemorrhage. Laboratory testing is therefore needed to confirm the diagnosis.\nLaboratory-confirmed cases have been reported in states bordering Cameroon (Adamawa, Benue, Cross Rivers, and Taraba) and states bordering Benin (Oyo and Niger). The overall regional and global risks are considered low because the primary mode of transmission of Lassa fever is through contact with food or household items contaminated with rat excreta. The rate of human-to-human transmission is low.",
        "Description of the Situation": "Nigeria is experiencing a large outbreak of Lassa fever, with 4702 suspected cases, five probable cases, and 877 confirmed cases between epidemiological weeks 1 and 15 of 2023 (week ending 16 April). Among confirmed cases, there have been 152 deaths (CFR 17%). This is a 20% increase in confirmed cases in comparison with those reported during the same period in 2022 (733).Cases have been reported from 101 local government areas (LGAs), in 26 out of 36 states, including the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). A high proportion of confirmed cases (72%) are concentrated in three states: Ondo (32%), Edo (29%) and Bauchi (11%). Laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported in states bordering Cameroon (Adamawa, Benue, Cross Rivers, and Taraba) and states bordering Benin (Oyo and Niger).",
        "Epidemiology": "Lassa fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease caused by the Lassa virus. It is primarily transmitted to humans either through direct contact with infected\u00a0Mastomys\u00a0rodents, or through food or household items contaminated with the urine or faeces of infected rodents. Consequently, the virus is transmitted to humans through cuts and scratches or inhaled via dust particles in the air. Human-to-human transmission can occur through direct contact with an infected person's blood or bodily fluids, but this is rare. Lassa fever can spread in healthcare settings without early recognition and treatment and without adequate infection prevention and control (IPC) measures.Most cases (\u223c 80%) are asymptomatic or mild, but the virus can cause severe disease in the remaining 20% of patients, sometimes associated with multiple organ dysfunction with or without haemorrhage. Lassa fever is difficult to diagnose without proper laboratory tests because it can present with various symptoms, ranging from no symptoms to multiple organ failure and death.\u00a0The case fatality rate is usually between 1% and 15% in patients hospitalized with severe disease. The disease is particularly severe in late pregnancy, with maternal death and/or fetal loss occurring in the third trimester in over 80% of cases. Early supportive care with rehydration and symptomatic treatment is critical and improves survival. The antiviral ribavirin has been used to treat Lassa fever but its efficacy is unproven. There is currently no vaccine that protects against Lassa fever.The disease was first identified in Nigeria in Borno State in 1969 and is endemic in Nigeria. Transmission occurs throughout the year. However, large seasonal outbreaks occur during the dry season, typically from December to April.\u00a0During epidemiological weeks 1 to 15 of 2023, 42 cases were reported among healthcare workers across 11 states. In week 15 of 2023 (10-16 April), 141 new suspected cases, nine new confirmed cases, and one new confirmed death were reported (CFR 11%).\u00a0\u00a0Responding to the current outbreak is challenging due to the need to respond to multiple emergencies simultaneously. These include outbreaks of COVID-19, diphtheria, meningitis, measles, and cholera, and ongoing humanitarian crises. In addition, the country is dealing with security challenges that affect the timeliness of the response.",
        "Public Health Response": "The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (NCDC) and health authorities of affected states are leading the response to the outbreak. An NCDC Emergency Operations Center (EOC) was activated on 28 January 2023 and Rapid Response Teams (RRTs) have been deployed to the states of Bauchi, Benue, Ebonyi, Edo, Ondo, and Taraba.\u00a0\u00a0Response activities include: Surveillance: detection, monitoring of cases and outbreaks, and laboratory testing; Case management;Prevention measures: public education on personal hygiene, food safety, and rodent control in homes and workplaces;Control measures: administration of antiviral drugs to confirmed cases, supportive care, and contact tracing to identify people who may have been exposed to the virus.\u00a0To improve the response to Lassa fever outbreaks in Nigeria, the NCDC has developed a national action plan, with WHO and other partners, to prevent and control Lassa fever outbreaks. This plan focuses on strengthening surveillance activities, improving and expanding national laboratory capacity, increasing public awareness, and improving the availability of treatment and care for patients.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Lassa fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic fever endemic to West Africa.\u00a0Confirmed outbreaks and sporadic cases have been reported in Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Guinea, Ghana, Liberia, Mali, Sierra Leone, Togo and Nigeria. In some regions, Mastomys rodents are consumed as food. \u00a0Although Nigeria is an endemic country for Lassa fever and has developed capacity to manage Lassa fever outbreaks, the current overall risk at the national level is considered high due to several factors: An increase in the number of confirmed cases compared with the same period in previous epidemic seasons; Reduced national capacity due to multiple ongoing health emergencies that have overwhelmed the country's health system and limited access to medical resources; Shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE), resulting in a high risk of healthcare-associated infections; Delays in sample transport for laboratory testing in several states, delaying confirmation of diagnosis and linkage to treatment and care; Inadequate health infrastructure, poor sanitation and the continued presence of disease-carrying rodents; and Lack of awareness and education about Lassa fever among the public and healthcare workers, likely leading to further delays in diagnosis and treatment, increasing the risk of transmission and potential deaths.\u00a0The overall regional and global risks are considered low because the primary mode of transmission of Lassa fever is zoonotic and the rate of human-to-human transmission is low.",
        "WHO Advice": "Prevention of Lassa fever requires the promotion of good community hygiene to prevent rodents from entering homes. Effective measures include storing grain and other food in rodent-proof containers, disposing of garbage away from homes, keeping homes clean, and keeping cats in the home.\u00a0In healthcare settings, staff should always follow standard precautions for the prevention and control of healthcare-associated infections when caring for patients, regardless of the presumed diagnosis. These precautions include hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, personal protective equipment against splashes or other contact with contaminated materials, injection safety, and safe burial rites.\u00a0Healthcare workers caring for suspected or confirmed cases of Lassa fever should take additional infection control measures to avoid contact with the patient's blood or body fluids and contaminated surfaces or materials such as clothing and bedding. When in close contact with patients (within one metre), healthcare workers should wear: face protection (face shield or surgical mask and goggles); a clean, non-sterile, long-sleeved gown; and gloves (sterile for certain medical procedures). No vaccine for Lassa fever is currently available for use in humans. The antiviral drug ribavirin may be an effective treatment for Lassa fever if given early on in the course of the illness, but data are inconsistent. There is no evidence to support the role of ribavirin as post-exposure prophylactic treatment for Lassa fever.\u00a0WHO continues to advise all countries where Lassa fever is endemic to improve early case detection and treatment to reduce fatalities.\u00a0WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel or trade to or from Nigeria based on the information in this report.",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "Since 2022, Indonesia has recorded an increase in suspected and confirmed measles cases compared to previous years. Between 1 January and 3 April 2023, a total of 2161 suspected measles cases (848 laboratory-confirmed and 1313 clinically compatible [suspected]) have been reported across 18 of 38 provinces in Indonesia, primarily from the provinces of West Java (796 cases), Central Papua (770 cases), and Banten (197 cases).\nMeasles is endemic in Indonesia and is reported every year. However, in 2022 and 2023, there has been a significant increase in the number of confirmed cases, as compared to those reported annually since 2018: there were 920 reported cases in 2018, 639 in 2019, 310 in 2020, and 132 in 2021.\nThe current outbreak is characterized by suboptimal population immunity, including children without measles vaccination. Supplemental immunization activity (SIA) was conducted in 2022, targeting children <15 years old in high-risk provinces (Aceh, North Sumatera, Riau, Riau Islands, and West Sumatera), 9 \u2013 59 months old in provinces in Java-Bali, and 9 months to 12 years old in the remaining provinces, with efforts to strengthen routine immunization and catch-up activities ongoing to address the population immunity gaps.",

The provinces mainly affected were Aceh (978 cases), West Sumatra (859 cases), Riau (500 cases), and East Java (459 cases). Annual trend analysis shows the number of cases reported annually in 2022 and currently in 2023 is higher than usual: there were 920 cases in 2018, 639 cases in 2019, 310 cases in 2020, and 132 cases in 2021 (Figure 1).Figure 1: Number of measles cases reported by month of onset of symptoms and confirmation category. Indonesia. January 2019 \u2013 March 2023.Source: Indonesia Ministry of HealthIn 2022, among the 4845 confirmed measles cases with available age information, 93% (4502) were between 1 and 14 years old. However, a few cases have also been observed in the older age group, with at least 41 cases reported among people over 40. Among the confirmed cases, 67% had not received any dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV), 6% had received one dose, 7% had received both doses, and vaccination history was unknown for 21 % (991) of confirmed cases (Figure 3).In 2023, among the 2076 confirmed cases with available age information, 95% (1978) were between 1 and 14 years of age. Among the confirmed cases, 75% had not received any dose of MCV, while 11% had received one dose, 10% had received both doses, and vaccination history was unknown for 3%.

Indonesia. (n=2138)Source: Indonesia Ministry of HealthThe current outbreak is mainly characterized by suboptimal population immunity, as evidenced by the increased gap in immunity (Figure 2). According to the WHO/UNICEF Joint Reporting Form (JRF), the vaccination coverage in Indonesia in 2020 was 87% for measles-containing-vaccine first-dose (MCV1) and only 65% for measles-containing-vaccine second dose (MCV2). In 2021, national coverage of MCV1 was 87%, and MCV2 was 59%, with variation in administrative vaccination coverage at the sub-national level; these data indicate a very high number of children are susceptible to measles infection.",
        "Epidemiology": "Measles is a human disease caused by a virus in the paramyxovirus family. The virus infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body. It can lead to major epidemics with significant morbidity and mortality, especially among vulnerable people. Among young and malnourished children, pregnant women, and immunocompromised individuals, including those with HIV, cancer or treated with immunosuppressives, measles can cause serious complications, including severe diarrhea, blindness, encephalitis, pneumonia, and death.Transmission is primarily person-to-person by airborne respiratory droplets that disperse rapidly when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Transmission can also occur through direct contact with infected secretions. Transmission from asymptomatic exposed immune persons has not been demonstrated. The virus remains contagious in the air or on contaminated surfaces for up to two hours. A patient is infectious from four days before the start of the rash to four days after its appearance. There is no specific antiviral treatment for measles, but most people recover within 2-3 weeks.An effective and safe vaccine is available for prevention and control. The MCV1 is given at the age of nine months, while the MCV2 is given at the age of 15 months. A 95% population coverage of MCV1 and MCV2 is required to stop measles circulation.In areas with low vaccination coverage, epidemics typically occur every two to three years and usually last between two and three months. However, their duration varies according to population size, crowding, and the population\u2019s immunity status.Several measles outbreaks have been reported in Indonesia between 2011 to 2023. One of the biggest outbreaks occurred in East Java province in 2016 where 3765 cases were reported, associated with low vaccination coverage levels.",
        "Public Health Response": "Indonesia conducted supplemental immunization activity (SIA) in 2022, targeting children <15 years old for high-risk provinces (Aceh, North Sumatera, Riau, Riau Islands and West Sumatera), 9-59 months old for provinces in Java-Bali, and 9 months to 12 years old for the remaining provinces.Active case search and line listing of fever and rash cases is ongoing. Vitamin A is given to those identified with fever and rash during case investigation.\u00a0 Human resources have been deployed to the affected provinces to improve surveillance, particularly at the community level. Efforts are underway to procure reagents needed for laboratory testing enzyme-link immunosorbent assay (ELISA).Promotion of routine immunization and catch-up activities is taking place via a multisectoral collaboration between the government, the community and partners, including the capacity building of immunization staff, strengthening the routine immunization information system and conducting a routine desk review to evaluate vaccination coverage.Coordination is taking place with the Indonesian Pediatric Society to disseminate the updated clinical management guidelines to health care workers. Capacity building on clinical management in the form of online training was conducted in 2022 in collaboration with the Indonesian Pediatric Society.Job aids have been developed to improve routine immunization coverage.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "While measles is endemic in Indonesia and is reported yearly, the magnitude and extent of this outbreak is high compared to previous years. Based on the current data and available information, the overall risk of measles at the national level is assessed as high for the following reasons:Likely under-detection and under-reporting of measles cases due to non-availability of laboratory reagents for confirmation of cases. The number of suspect measles cases reported in the Early Warning Alert and Response System (EWARS) has continued to increase since week 1 in 2023. An increase in hospitalization of suspect measles cases is observed in some provinces, including Papua province.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Low MCV1 and MCV2 coverage in most provinces, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2021); 28% of the birth cohort in 2021 have not received any measles vaccination and are thus at high risk for measles infection. Also, 22% of the children have been only partially vaccinated. Low measles-containing vaccine supplemental immunization activities (MCV-SIA) coverage in 2022, especially in high-risk provinces. There is vaccine hesitancy in the high-risk provinces, and limited capacity for outbreak response immunization (ORI), which is also impacted due to vaccine hesitancy.\u00a0 Low surveillance sensitivity in 2020-2021. As surveillance improved in 2022, more cases were reported from the subnational level. The overall surveillance sensitivity of measles and rubella i.e., the non-measles non rubella (NMNR) discard rate, was 3.33 per 100,000 population compared to the global standard of \u22652.0 per 100000 population. However, only 33% (170) districts achieved at least 2 NMNR discarded rate. In 2023, NMNR discard rate to date is at 0.46.The B3 genotype detected in West Kalimantan and East Java is not originally endemic to Indonesia.",
        "WHO Advice": "Measles is preventable by vaccination, which provides lifelong immunity in most recipients. In countries with low vaccination coverage, epidemics may occur every two to three years. However, their duration varies according to population size, crowding, and the population's immunity status.The measles vaccine has been in use for nearly 60 years. It is safe, effective, and inexpensive. Vaccination is recommended for all susceptible children and adults for whom the vaccine is not contraindicated. National immunization programs must ensure the safe provision of immunization services that can reach all children with two doses of the measles vaccine. Routine measles vaccination for children and mass immunization campaigns in countries with high case and death rates are key public health strategies to reduce global measles deaths. WHO recommends maintaining sustained homogeneous coverage of at least 95% with the first and second doses of the MCV vaccine and strengthening integrated epidemiological surveillance of measles and rubella to achieve timely detection of all suspected cases in public, private, and social security healthcare facilities. WHO continues to strengthen the global laboratory network to ensure timely diagnosis of measles and track the international spread of the measles viruses to allow a more coordinated country approach in targeting vaccination activities and reducing deaths from this vaccine-preventable disease.It is critical to quickly recognize and treat measles complications to reduce the disease\u2019s severity and mortality. Severe complications from measles can be reduced through supportive care that ensures good nutrition, adequate fluid intake, and treatment of dehydration with WHO-recommended oral rehydration solution. This solution replaces fluids and other essential elements lost through diarrhoea or vomiting. Antibiotics should be prescribed to treat eye and ear infections and pneumonia.While there is no specific antiviral treatment for measles, prompt vitamin A in therapeutic doses is recommended to reduce complications and mortality among children infected with measles. Two doses of vitamin A oral supplements should be given 24 hours apart, irrespective of the timing of previous doses of vitamin A: 50 000 IU should be given to infants aged < 6 months, 100 000 IU to infants aged 6-11 months, and 200 000 IU to children aged 12-59 months. This treatment restores low vitamin A levels in acute measles cases that occur even in well-nourished children and can help prevent eye damage and blindness. Vitamin A supplements have also been shown to reduce the number of measles deaths.WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel or trade to or from Indonesia based on the information presented in this report.",

        "Date Reported": "27 April 2023",
        "Location": "Nigeria",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "Since the beginning of 2023, 557 confirmed cases of diphtheria have been detected in Nigeria, affecting 21 of the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory.\nIn December 2022, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (NCDC) was notified of suspected diphtheria outbreaks in Kano and Lagos States. From 14 May 2022 to 9 April 2023, 1439 suspected cases have been reported, of which 557 (39%) have been confirmed, including 73 deaths among the confirmed cases (case fatality ratio of 13%). Nigeria has previously reported diphtheria outbreaks, with the most significant reported in 2011 affecting the rural areas of Borno State, in the northeast of the country. Diphtheria is a highly contagious vaccine-preventable disease which spreads between people mainly by direct contact or through the air via respiratory droplets. The disease can affect all age groups, however unimmunized children are particular at risk. It is potentially fatal.\nThe disease can be treated by administering diphtheria antitoxin as well as antibiotics. Vaccination against diphtheria has reduced the mortality and morbidity of diphtheria dramatically.",
        "Description of the Situation": "The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (NCDC) was notified of suspected diphtheria outbreaks in Kano and Lagos States on 1 December 2022. In January 2023, the number of confirmed cases increased, peaking at over 150 cases in week 4 of 2023 (ending 28 January); since then, a weekly decreasing trend has been observed. From 14 May 2022 to 9 April 2023, 1439, suspected diphtheria cases were reported from 21 states in Nigeria, with the majority (83%) of cases reported from Kano (1188), Yobe (97), Katsina (61), Lagos (25), Sokoto (14) and Zamfara (13). Of the 1439 suspected cases, 557 (39%) were confirmed (51 laboratory-confirmed, 504 clinically compatible and two epidemiologically linked), 483 (34%) were discarded, and 399 (28%) are pending classification. Laboratory-confirmed cases were reported from Kano (45), Lagos (3), Kaduna (1), Katsina (1), and Osun (1) states. Among the 557 confirmed cases, 73 deaths were recorded, for a CFR of 13%. The CFR has dropped significantly since the beginning of the outbreak due to, among other factors, increased access to diphtheria antitoxin (DAT).Nigeria had recorded diphtheria outbreaks in the past. The most significant outbreak reported was between February and November 2011 in the rural areas of Borno State, north-eastern Nigeria, where 98 cases were reported.\u00a0Figure 1: Epidemic curve of diphtheria cases by year/epi-week in Nigeria, epi-week 19 2022 \u2013 epi-week 14 2023Figure 2: Distribution of Diphtheria cases by state in Nigeria from Epi week 19, 2022 to Epi week 14, 2023",
        "Epidemiology": "Diphtheria is a highly contagious vaccine-preventable disease caused by exotoxin-producing\u00a0Corynebacterium diphtheriae\u00a0It spreads between people mainly by direct contact or through the air via respiratory droplets. The disease can affect all age groups, however unimmunized children are particular at risk. It is potentially fatal. \u00a0Symptoms often come on gradually, beginning with a sore throat and fever. In severe cases, the bacteria produce a poison (toxin) that causes a thick grey or white patch at the back of throat. This can block the airways, making it hard to breathe or swallow, and also creates a barking cough. The neck may swell in part due to enlarged lymph nodes. Treatment involves administering diphtheria antitoxin as well as antibiotics. Vaccination against diphtheria has reduced the mortality and morbidity of diphtheria dramatically. Diphtheria is fatal in 5 - 10% of cases, with a higher mortality rate in young children. However, in settings with poor access to diphtheria antitoxin, the CFR can be as high as 40%.",
        "Public Health Response": "Under the leadership of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (NCDC), coordination and monitoring of diphtheria surveillance and response activities in the country are ongoing through the weekly diphtheria National Technical Working Group meetings.Rapid Response Teams (RRTs) have been deployed to Katsina, Osun and Yobe States and re-deployed to Kano and Lagos States to support response activities.Harmonization of surveillance and laboratory data across states and laboratories is ongoing.Sensitization/training of clinical and surveillance officers has taken place in states where RRTs were deployed, on the presentation, prevention, and surveillance of diphtheria.Cascaded trainings were conducted in their respective states by some of the laboratory scientists/physicians trained at the NCDC National Reference Laboratory (NRL), Abuja.Procurement for reagents and sample collection and transportation materials/media processes has been initiated.Drug sensitivity tests are ongoing at NCDC NRL on isolates sent in from states.Distribution of DAT to the affected states has been ongoing since December 2022.Strengthening of routine immunization activities across the country continues.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Diphtheria cases are under-reported in Nigeria, with few reports of outbreaks in the past. The last outbreak was reported between February and November 2011 in the village of Kimba and its surrounding settlements in Borno State, north-eastern Nigeria, where 98 cases were reported. The diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccine third dose coverage in Nigeria is suboptimal. According to the 2021 Nigeria Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) and National Immunization Coverage Survey (NICS), the third dose of pentavalent vaccine coverage was 57% in 2021.The country is currently faced with several public health emergencies such as Lassa fever, cholera, mpox, meningitis and a humanitarian emergency in the northeast of the country. Due to insecurity, especially in north-eastern Nigeria, vaccination coverage remains suboptimal, especially in the areas controlled by non-state armed groups. Therefore, the outbreak of diphtheria further complicates and strains the already overstretched resources. The global supply of diphtheria antitoxin (DAT) is limited, and this may affect the availability of the required doses in a timely manner.The overall risk of diphtheria in Nigeria was assessed as high at the national level, low at the regional level, and low at the global level.",
        "WHO Advice": "Epidemiological surveillance ensuring early detection of diphtheria outbreaks should be in place in all countries, and all countries should have access to laboratory facilities that allow for the reliable identification of toxigenic\u00a0C. diphtheriae. For the adequate medical management of cases, sufficient quantities of diphtheria antitoxin should be available nationally or regionally.WHO recommends early reporting and management of suspected diphtheria cases to initiate timely treatment of cases and follow-up of contacts and ensure the supply of diphtheria antitoxin. Case management should be carried out following the WHO guideline and involve administering antitoxin to neutralize the toxin and antibiotics to kill the bacteria, reducing complication and mortality. \u00a0As vaccination is key to preventing cases and outbreaks, high-risk populations such as children under five years of age, schoolchildren, close contact of diphtheria cases, and healthcare workers, should be vaccinated with diphtheria-containing vaccines on a priority basis. A coordinated response and community engagement can support control of the ongoing outbreak.Although travellers do not have a special risk of diphtheria infection, it is recommended that national authorities remind travellers going to areas with diphtheria outbreaks to be appropriately vaccinated in accordance with their national vaccination scheme. A booster dose is recommended if more than five years have passed since the last dose.WHO does not recommend any travel and/or trade restrictions to Nigeria based on the information available for this event.",

        "Location": "Nigeria",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "Between 1 October 2022 and 16 April 2023, Nigeria reported a total of 1686 suspected cases of meningitis, including 124 deaths, for a case fatality ratio (CFR) of 7%.\nMeningitis is a serious infection of the meninges, the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. It is a devastating disease and a major public health challenge. Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus), Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus) are the main causative agents for meningitis. Vaccines can help prevent meningococcal disease.",
        "Description of the Situation": "From 1 October 2022 to 16 April 2023, a total of 1686 suspected cases, 532 confirmed cases and 124 deaths (CFR: 7%) have been reported from 81 local government areas (LGAs) in 22 out of 36 administrative states, including the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), in Nigeria.\u00a0 Males account for 57% (n = 961) of total suspected cases. The highest proportion of reported cases is among children aged 1 to 15 years. Jigawa state accounts for 74% (n = 1252) of all suspected cases, and this state borders the Zinder region in Niger, where a meningitis outbreak has been reported since October 2022. A total of 481 cerebrospinal fluid samples were collected from patients in 18 states. Out of these samples, 247 tested positive for bacterial infection by PCR test. Among the positive cases, 226 (91%) were caused by Neisseria meningitidis serogroup C (NmC), while 13 cases (5.4%) were caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, and only one case (0.4%) by Haemophilus influenzae. For 232 samples the result was negative, and for two the result is pending. In the last five weeks alone (epidemiological weeks 11-15), 41 out of 140 samples tested (29%) were positive for NmC. The confirmed cases were reported from eight states including Jigawa (231), Zamfara (six), Yobe (five), Benue (one), Gombe (one), Katsina (one), Oyo (one), and Sokoto (one).Fig. 1.\u00a0Map indicating meningitis cases (n = 1686 suspected cases) between 1 October 2022 and 16 April 2023\u00a0Source: Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (NCDC)Jigawa state consists of 27 LGAs, of which 25 have reported at least one suspected case. There have been 66 deaths in Jigawa state. During the current outbreak, Maigatari LGA and Sule-tankarkar LGA have both crossed the epidemic threshold of 10 suspected cases per 100 000 population and account for 60% of the total reported cases, with 505 and 247 cases respectively.The CFR for this outbreak is 7% and 5% at the national and Jigawa state level, respectively.Fig. 2.\u00a0Weekly distribution of meningitis cases (n = 1686 suspected cases) between 1 October 2022 and 16 April 2023",
        "Epidemiology": "Meningitis is a serious infection of the meninges, the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. It is a devastating disease and remains a major public health challenge. The disease can be caused by many different pathogens including bacteria, fungi or viruses, but the highest global burden is seen with bacterial meningitis.Several different bacteria can cause meningitis.\u00a0Streptococcus pneumoniae,\u00a0Haemophilus influenzae, and\u00a0Neisseria meningitidis\u00a0are the most frequent ones.\u00a0N. meningitidis, causing meningococcal meningitis, is the one with the potential to produce large epidemics.Meningococcal meningitis is transmitted from person to person through droplets of respiratory and throat secretions, usually by asymptomatic carriers. Close, prolonged contact with an infected person, or living with a carrier, facilitates the spread of the disease. The average incubation period is four days but can range between two and 10 days.The extended meningitis belt of sub-Saharan Africa, stretching from Senegal in the west to Ethiopia in the east (26 countries) and including the northern part of Nigeria, has the highest disease rates. \u00a0Meningitis in these countries follows a seasonal pattern, being most common during the dry season (December through June) with a peak between March and April, when there is persistent low air humidity and high dust loads that are believed to damage the pharyngeal mucosa and ease the colonization of the nasopharyngeal epithelium by the meningococci. Seasonal epidemics vary in size from year to year.Response measures implemented during an outbreak, including improved case finding and management as well as mass vaccination campaigns, contribute to outbreak control.Meningococcal meningitis remains a public health concern, in Nigeria, with outbreaks reported in recent years. With support from WHO, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (NCDC) is implementing response measures at the national level. These include vaccination, surveillance, active case finding, sample testing, and case management.",
        "Public Health Response": "With support from WHO, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (NCDC) is implementing response measures at the national level. These include:Daily coordination meetings being held at state and LGA levels since December 2022;Surveillance activities with rapid response teams continuing to conduct active case search;Case management activities at public health centres in affected LGAs;Vaccination activities in 17 high-priority wards in the priority LGAs of Maigatari, Sule-tankarkar, Gumel and Gagarawa \u2013 all in Jigawa state.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Nigeria has implemented interventions to combat meningitis, including introducing the meningococcal A (MenA) conjugate vaccine against NmA from 2011-2022. Through preventive campaigns, Nigeria has \u00a0vaccinated over 100 million people aged 1 to 29 years, and the vaccine has been included in the country\u2019s routine immunization schedule since 2019. Among MenA vaccinated populations in countries of the meningitis belt, the incidence of serogroup A meningitis has declined by more than 99%, and no serogroup A case has been confirmed since 2017. However, there are still annual reports of meningitis cases in the country that are associated mostly with meningococcus serogroup C (NmC).Insecurity, particularly in Northeast Nigeria, affects vaccination coverage, especially in areas controlled by non-state armed groups. At the national level, immunization coverage remains suboptimal at 50% as of 2021. Licensed vaccines against meningococcal, pneumococcal and Haemophilus influenzae diseases have been available for many years. These bacteria have several different strains (known as serotypes or serogroups), and vaccines are designed to protect against the most harmful strains. Over time, there have been major improvements in strain coverage and vaccine availability, but no universal vaccine against these infections exists.Additionally, in November 2022, an outbreak of meningitis was confirmed in the Zinder region of Niger. This region borders Jigawa, which is the worst-affected state in Nigeria. The risk of cross-border transmission is high due to the population movement across the border.Based on the above information, the overall risk of meningitis in Nigeria is assessed as high at the national level, moderate at the regional level, and low at the global level.",
        "WHO Advice": "Preventing meningitis through vaccination is the most effective way to reduce the burden and impact of the disease by delivering long-lasting protection. The anticipated rollout of multivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccines is a public health priority to eliminate bacterial meningitis epidemics in the African meningitis belt.Early diagnosis and treatment are critical in managing all types of meningococcal disease. Appropriate case management, active community-based case-finding, and reactive mass vaccination of affected populations are necessary in response to epidemics. Currently, there is an ongoing reactive vaccination campaign. To guide further response activities, it is crucial to monitor the spread of the disease to new areas, including considering further vaccine requests if appropriate. Timeliness of the reactive campaign is essential, with the goal being to initiate it within four weeks of crossing the epidemic threshold.WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel and trade to Nigeria based on the currently available information.",

        "Location": "Chile",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "This Disease Outbreak News is an update on the report published on 6 April 2023 concerning human infection caused by avian influenza A(H5N1) in Chile. Since then, WHO received information on the results of genomic sequencing and the ongoing public health response.\nOn 5 April, the results of genomic sequencing were completed by the Institute of Public Health of Chile (ISP per its acronym in Spanish), which is the National Influenza Centre (NIC) in Chile, which identified avian influenza virus A(H5N1) phylogenetic clade 2.3.4.4b. The genomic sequencing had 99.9% identity with H5 hemagglutinin sequences from Chilean birds, and complete neuraminidase (NA) had 100% identity with N1 sequences from Chilean birds.\nA total of 12 contacts (close contacts and healthcare workers) were identified. All tested negative for influenza and have completed the monitoring period. No further cases in Chile have been identified so far.\nAvian influenza infection in a human can cause severe disease and is notifiable under the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005) [1].",
        "Description of the Situation": "As reported previously, on 29 March 2023, the Ministry of Health of Chile notified WHO of the detection of human infection with avian influenza A(H5) virus.On 7 April 2023, the Chile International Health Regulations National Focal Point reported the results of genomic sequencing completed on 5 April 2023 by the NIC, which identified avian influenza A(H5N1) phylogenetic clade 2.3.4.4b. The patient is a 53-year-old male from the Region of Antofagasta in the north of Chile. He had no history of comorbidities or recent travel.On 13 March 2023, the patient developed symptoms including cough, sore throat, and hoarseness. On 21 March, due to worsening symptoms, he sought care at a local hospital. On 22 March 2023, the patient developed dyspnea and was admitted to a Regional Hospital at Antofagasta (SARI Sentinel Site). A nasopharyngeal swab sample was collected as part of routine severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) surveillance and tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). On 23 March, the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit and treatment with antivirals (oseltamivir) and antibiotics was initiated. The patient remains in respiratory isolation under multidisciplinary management, with mechanical ventilation due to pneumonia.\u00a0Standard infection control precautions were kept since the detection of the case. On 27 March, a bronchoalveolar sample was collected and tested positive for an unsubtypeable influenza A virus by PCR. The sample was sent to the ISP and tested positive for avian influenza A(H5) on 29 March. On 31 March, the NIC forwarded the patient's samples to a WHO Collaborating Centre for further characterization.\u00a0On 5 April, the results of genomic sequencing were completed by the NIC in Chile, which identified avian influenza virus A(H5N1) phylogenetic clade 2.3.4.4b. The genomic sequencing had 99.9% identity with H5 hemagglutinin sequences from Chilean birds, and complete neuraminidase (NA) had 100% identity with N1 sequences from Chilean birds.\u00a0 Three close contacts of the case were identified, all asymptomatic, tested negative for influenza and have concluded the monitoring period. Additionally, a total of nine contacts among healthcare workers were identified, all tested negative for influenza and concluded the monitoring period on 4 April. However, on 5 April one of them developed respiratory symptoms, therefore a nasopharyngeal swab was taken, which tested negative for influenza; the monitoring period for this contact was extended for seven additional days, ending on 11 April.Avian influenza A (H5N1) was first detected in the Region of the Americas in birds in December 2014. Between December 2022 and February 2023, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has been detected in wild aquatic birds (pelicans and penguins) and sea mammals (sea lions) in the Antofagasta Region where the case resides. According to preliminary findings of the epidemiological investigation of this human case, the most plausible route of transmission was through environmental exposure, given the large number of dead sea mammals and wild birds found in the area close to the patient\u00b4s residence.",
        "Epidemiology": "Zoonotic influenza infections in humans may range from asymptomatic or mild upper respiratory infection (fever and cough) to rapid progression to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, shock, and death, depending on factors related to the virus and the host. Rarely, gastrointestinal, or neurological symptoms have been reported. Human cases of avian influenza are usually the result of direct or indirect exposure to infected live or dead poultry or contaminated environments.In the Region of the Americas during 2022 and 2023, an increasing number of outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5) have been reported in backyard poultry, farm poultry, wild birds, and wild mammals. Since the first confirmation of avian influenza A(H5N1) in the region in 2014, three human infections caused by avian influenza A(H5) have been reported: the first in the United States of America, reported in April 2022; the second in Ecuador, reported in January 2023; and this case. Globally, since 2003, 873 human infections with A(H5N1) viruses, including 458 deaths (CFR 52%), have been reported to WHO.",
        "Public Health Response": "Additional public health activities have been reported since the last update. Intersectoral activities have been carried out by the Ministry of Health of Chile, the Agricultural and Livestock Service (SAG) and the National Fisheries and Aquaculture Service of Chile (SERNAPESCA), of the Ministry of Agriculture of Chile, among others, in order to follow up on the avian influenza outbreaks in Antofagasta Region and outbreaks in other Regions.Active monitoring of persons with respiratory symptoms and exposure to wild birds, poultry, and sea mammals has been undertaken.Seasonal influenza vaccination is being conducted in risk groups according to the guidelines of the National Immunization Program.\u00a0Regarding risk communication, the population has been informed about this case and prevention measures through messaging for different target audiences.The Ministry of Health of Chile is participating actively in the Disaster Risk Management Committee of the National Service for Disaster Prevention and Response (SENAPRED) to deal with the animal health emergency.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "WHO\u2019s risk assessment remains unchanged since the last update.  According to the preliminary findings of the local epidemiological investigation, the most plausible hypothesis about transmission is that it occurred through environmental exposure to areas where either sick or dead birds or sea mammals were found close to the residence of the case. According to the information received thus far, the virus has not been detected in other individuals. Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, wild birds or mammals, there is a risk for sporadic infection and small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected animals or contaminated environments. Public health measures have been implemented by both the human and animal health agencies, including monitoring healthcare workers and other contacts of the laboratory-confirmed case. Currently available epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that A(H5) viruses, including H5N1, have not acquired the capacity for sustained transmission among humans, thus the likelihood of human-to-human spread is low. Based on available information, WHO assesses the risk to the general population posed by this virus to be low. Should infected individuals from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during travel or after arrival. If this were to occur, further community-level spread is considered unlikely as this virus has not acquired the ability to transmit easily among humans. The preliminary risk assessment will be reviewed as needed should further epidemiological or virological information become available.",
        "WHO Advice": "Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, and the large outbreaks among animal populations, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect and monitor virological, epidemiological, and clinical changes associated with emerging or circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health, and of timely virus sharing for risk assessment. The diversity of zoonotic influenza viruses that have caused human infections is alarming and necessitates strengthened surveillance in both animal and human populations, thorough investigation of every zoonotic infection, and pandemic preparedness planning. Vaccination of poultry workers with seasonal influenza vaccine has been advised to prevent a viral mutation that could facilitate human-to-human transmission.WHO does not advise special traveler screening at points of entry. \u00a0In the case of a confirmed or suspected human infection with a novel influenza virus with pandemic potential, including avian influenza and variant viruses, contact tracing should be initiated and a thorough epidemiologic investigation of history of exposure to animals and of travel should be conducted. The epidemiologic investigation should include early identification of unusual clusters of respiratory disease that could signal person-to-person transmission of the novel virus, and clinical samples collected from the time and place that the case occurred should be tested and then sent to a WHO Collaborating Centre for further characterization. There are no approved vaccines for preventing influenza A(H5) in humans. Candidate vaccine viruses to prevent influenza A(H5) infection in humans have been developed for pandemic preparedness purposes.\u00a0Given the observed extent and frequency of avian influenza cases in wild birds and some wild mammals, the public should avoid contact with animals that are sick or dead from unknown causes and should report the occurrence to the authorities.Travelers to countries with known outbreaks of animal influenza should avoid farms, contact with animals in live animal markets, entering areas where animals may be slaughtered, or contact with\u00a0any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with animal faeces or other body fluids. Travelers should also wash their hands often with soap and water and follow good food safety and food hygiene practices.Close analysis of the epidemiological situation, further characterization of the most recent viruses found in humans and animals, and serological investigations, are critical to assess risk and to adjust risk management measures in a timely manner. All human infections caused by a novel influenza subtype are notifiable under the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005), and States Parties to the IHR are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic. Evidence of illness is not required for this notification.",

        "Description of the Situation": "On 13 February 2023, the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare of Equatorial Guinea declared an outbreak of Marburg virus disease (MVD) after suspected viral hemorrhagic fever deaths were reported between 7 January and 7 February 2023, and a case tested positive on 12 February for Marburg virus by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at the Institute Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal.Since the last Disease Outbreak News on this event (22 March 2023) and as of 11 April 2023, six additional laboratory-confirmed cases of MVD were reported in Equatorial Guinea, bringing the total of cases in the outbreak to 15 laboratory-confirmed. Additionally, 23 probable cases have been reported since the start of the outbreak. Eleven deaths were recorded among laboratory-confirmed cases (Case Fatality Ratio (CFR) among confirmed cases 78.6%), and all probable cases are dead; for one confirmed case the outcome is unknown. Four laboratory-confirmed cases (26.6%) were reported among healthcare workers, of whom two died. Among the confirmed cases, three have recovered.Figure 1. MVD cases by week of onset* and case classification, Equatorial Guinea, as of 11 April 2023. Among MVD laboratory-confirmed cases with age and sex information (n = 13), the majority occurred among females (9/14; 64.3%), while the most affected age group is 40-49 years (6/14; 42.8%), followed by the age groups 10-19 and 30-39 (three cases each).Five districts (Bata, Ebebiyin, Evinayong, Nsok Nsomo and Nsork) in four provinces (Centro Sur, Kie Ntem, Litoral and Wele-Nzas) have been affected by the outbreak (Figure \u00a02), with Bata district reporting the majority of confirmed cases (n = 9) and deaths (n = 6), and Ebebiyin district, where the outbreak was first detected, reporting the majority of probable cases,(n = 11) (Table 1).In the last 21 days (from 22 March 2023 to 11 April 2023),\u00a0five confirmed cases were reported from Bata (n = 4) and Nsork (n = 1) districts (Figure 3). Among the four cases reported from Bata district, three cases have an epidemiological link either through a family cluster or through health care setting.\u00a0The fourth and most recent case was reported on 7 April; an investigation of this case is ongoing to establish transmission chains and ensure appropriate identification of all contacts.Since the last Disease Outbreak News\u00a0on this event, one new district, Nsork in Wele-Nzas province, has been affected by the outbreak, reporting one confirmed case, linked to a known case from another district that previously reported confirmed cases.Since the start of the outbreak and as of 10 April 2023, a total of 1322 contacts have been listed, with an average follow-up rate around 80-90%.Table 1.\u00a0Number of MVD cases and deaths, by district and case classification, Equatorial Guinea, as of 11 April 2023.

        "Epidemiology": "Marburg virus spreads between people via direct contact through broken skin or mucous membranes with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people, and with surfaces and materials such as bedding, clothing contaminated with these fluids. Healthcare workers have previously been infected while treating patients with suspected or confirmed MVD. Burial ceremonies that involve direct contact with the body of the deceased can also contribute to the transmission of Marburg virus. The incubation period varies from two to 21 days. Illness caused by Marburg virus begins abruptly, with high fever, severe headache, and severe malaise. Severe haemorrhagic manifestations may appear between five and seven days from symptom onset, although not all cases have haemorrhagic signs, \u00a0and fatal cases usually have some form of bleeding, often from multiple areas.\u00a0Although no vaccines or antiviral treatments are approved to treat the virus, Remdesivir is being used on compassionate care bases. Supportive care \u2013 rehydration with oral or intravenous fluids \u2013 and treatment of specific symptoms improve survival. A range of potential treatments are being evaluated, including blood products, immune therapies, and drug therapies.\u00a0This is the first time that Equatorial Guinea has reported an outbreak of MVD. Another MVD outbreak is currently taking place in Tanzania with a total of eight confirmed cases and five deaths as of 4 April 2023. Other MVD outbreaks have been previously reported in Ghana (2022), Guinea (2021), Uganda (2017, 2014, 2012, 2007), Angola (2004-2005), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (1998 and 2000), Kenya (1990, 1987, 1980) and South Africa (1975).",
        "Public Health Response": "Coordination The Government has activated a regional public health emergency operation center (PHEOC) in Bata under the leadership of the Minister of Health and the Minister Delegate.A national operational response plan has been developed by the MoH.Regular meetings are held by the MoH to coordinate response activities at national, regional and district level.Partners from the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) have been mobilized to assist response activities. In collaboration with Incident Management team GOARN issued Request for assistance on 30 March. Several experts are deployed and in process of being deployed to support case management, infection prevention and control, laboratory, and epidemiology and surveillance functions in the field.SurveillanceWHO supported the Ministry of Health in setting up an alert and dispatch center for MVD alert management across the region.WHO is supporting the Ministry of Health in training for surveillance activities, including case investigation, contact tracing, active case search in health facilities and the community, and in supervising field teams.WHO is supporting the Ministry of Health in epidemiological data collection and management system, and developed and disseminated a reviewed case definition, validated by the Ministry of Health.Laboratory With the support of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and WHO, a laboratory with RT-PCR capacities has been set up in Bata for MVD diagnostic. \u00a0WHO is supporting the implementation of a specimen transportation system, and discussions are on-going to support the establishment of sequencing capacities in the country. Additional national staff are being trained on Marburg virus diagnostics by the WHO.\u00a0Clinical careWHO supported the Ministry of Health in the establishment an operational treatment and isolation centre in Bata, and is planning to open additional treatment facilities in other districts.Assessments visits were carried out at identified treatment and isolation centers to identify and address gaps.WHO is supporting awareness campaigns of clinical staff to help surveillance and reporting.Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) An IPC task force has been initiated, and a national IPC strategy is currently in draft form.An IPC Scorecard for assessment of health facility IPC practices for readiness and response to Marburg has been implemented.Trainings for health workers on IPC are in progress, including decontamination and safe and dignified burial teams (SBD).Safe and dignified burials teams have been established in Bata and Ebibeyin.Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE) WHO is coordinating with other key partners for joint support on RCCE activities (UNICEF, IFRC among others).WHO is supporting public awareness and capacity building for RCCE national experts, social mobilisers and community leaders (such as Civil Society Organizations, religious leaders, and women groups).The recruitment of national RCCE consultants and deployment of an international expert have been conducted. An RCCE national plan is under development and a rapid social behavioural survey is being prepared for implementation. The Message Bank for Marburg has been developed and disseminated. The message bank is available in Spanish and English, with ongoing translation in Swahili, French and Portuguese.A list of frequently asked questions and answers on Marburg virus disease, which will be accessible to the public, is under development.WHO is providing technical support to the development of tools and education and communication (IEC) materials for preparedness in Gabon and Cameroon.\u00a0Border health and points of entryA needs and capacity assessment has been conducted to strengthen response capacities at points of entry through, for example, the development of contingency plans and standard operating procedures, the training of point-of-entry staff on the identification of signs and symptoms of MVD and the management of potential cases, implementation of risk communication and community engagement activities and the provision of handwashing and transportation capabilities. WHO is working with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) on an upcoming webinar to raise awareness on the necessary border health readiness and response activities in the context of MVD outbreaks for affected and neighboring countries.\u00a0Operational support and logistics (OSL)\u200bWHO has established support for fleet management including two ambulances on standby 24/7 at the Bata treatment centr\u200be, and over 20 vehicles. WHO has provided essential medicines and supplies.\u00a0Readiness and preparedness in neighboring countries WHO has conducted a second readiness assessment across all pillars for the two surrounding countries, Cameroon and Gabon, and based on their gaps, activities to address them will be recommended including the deployment of experts to support the implementation of some of the readiness activities. The WHO is working with Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea and Gabon to coordinate a high-level cross-border meeting.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Equatorial Guinea is facing an outbreak of MVD for the first time and the country's capacity to manage the outbreak needs to be strengthened. In addition to the nine confirmed cases reported in the Disease Outbreak News of 22 March, six more individuals have tested positive for MVD, with an additional affected province. While many cases are linked within a social network or by geographic proximity, the presence of cases and/or clusters across multiple districts without clear epidemiologic links may indicate undetected transmission of the virus. The presence of confirmed cases in Bata increases the risk of disease spread, as it is the most populated city and economic hub of Equatorial Guinea, with an international airport and port. Bata has also reported the highest number of confirmed cases and confirmed deaths. The last case was also reported from Bata and investigation is ongoing to establish transmission chains. The country surveillance system remains suboptimal with few alerts reported and investigated. Several epidemiological links and transmission chains have not been detected, thus there might be contacts not identified. Implemented infection prevention and control measures are insufficient as demonstrated by MVD cases reported among healthcare workers. The diagnostic capacity for Marburg virus in the country is limited in terms of the number of samples that can be analyzed per day (a maximum of around 50 a day).\u00a0The community's perception of risk is estimated to be very low.\u00a0There are frequent population movements between the different districts of the mainland region, as well as with the island region, despite the quarantine measures implemented in several of the affected areas. Frequent population movements and very porous land borders are also reported in the districts bordering Cameroon and Gabon, with surveillance at land entry points being suboptimal, and countless uncontrolled paths or trails along the border with Cameroon and Gabon.\u00a0Also, surveillance at the entry points of the international Bata airport or international seaport, is not optimal.\u00a0Considering the above-described situation, on 30 March 2023, WHO assessed the risk posed by this outbreak as very high at the national level, high at sub-regional level, moderate at the regional level and low at the global level.",
        "WHO Advice": "Marburg virus disease outbreak control relies on using a range of interventions, such as prompt isolation and case management; surveillance including active case search, case investigation and contact tracing; an optimal laboratory service; infection prevention and control, including prompt safe and dignified burial; and social mobilization. Community engagement is key to successfully controlling Marburg disease outbreaks. Raising awareness of risk factors for infection with Marburg virus and the protective measures that individuals can take is an effective way to reduce human transmission. Health and care workers caring for patients with confirmed or suspected MVD should apply IPC measures including standard and transmission-based precautions to avoid contact with the patient\u2019s blood and body fluids and with contaminated surfaces and objects. Health facilities should ensure environmental controls, such as adequate water, sanitation and hygiene, as well as that safe infectious waste management protocols are in place to enable health workers to practice IPC measures. WHO recommends that male survivors of MVD practice safer sex for 12 months from onset of symptoms, or until their semen twice tests negative for the Marburg virus. Contact with body fluids should be avoided and washing with soap and water is recommended. WHO does not recommend isolation of male or female convalescent patients whose blood has tested negative for the Marburg virus.Based on the available information and current risk assessment, WHO advises to strengthen surveillance at points of entry in the affected areas in Equatorial Guinea for the identification of cases, including through exit screening; to map cross-border population mobility to identify populations in vulnerable situations and target public health interventions; and to provide public health information and advice in all relevant languages at points of entry and in adjacent communities near land borders. In addition, suspect, probable and confirmed cases and their contacts should not undertake travel, including international. WHO advises against any other international travel and/or trade measures in Equatorial Guinea.States Parties adopting international travel- and trade-related measures potentially more restrictive than those advised by WHO, are invited to report them to WHO, pursuant to Article 43 of the International Health Regulations (2005).",

        "Date Reported": "11 April 2023",
        "Location": "China",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 27 March 2023, the National Health Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China notified WHO of one confirmed case of human infection with an avian influenza A(H3N8) virus. This is the third reported case of human infection with an avian influenza A(H3N8) virus; all three cases have been reported from China.\nEpidemiological investigation and close contact tracing have been carried out. There have been no other cases found among close contacts of the infected individual.\nBased on available information, it appears that this virus does not have the ability to spread easily from person to person, and therefore the risk of it spreading among humans at the national, regional, and international levels is considered to be low. However, due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO stresses the importance of global surveillance to detect virological, epidemiological and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses which may affect human (or animal) health.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 27 March 2023, the National Health Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China notified WHO of one confirmed case of human infection with an avian influenza A(H3N8) virus. The patient was a 56-year-old female from Guangdong province with an onset of illness on 22 February 2023. She was hospitalized for severe pneumonia on 3 March 2023 and subsequently died on 16 March 2023.The case was detected through the severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) surveillance system. The patient had multiple underlying conditions. She had a history of exposure to live poultry before the onset of the disease, and a history of wild bird presence around her home. No close contacts of the case developed an infection or symptoms of illness at the time of reporting. Environmental samples were collected from the patient's residence and the wet market where the patient spent time before the onset of illness. The results of testing showed that the samples collected from the wet market were positive for influenza A(H3).",
        "Epidemiology": "Zoonotic influenza infections in humans may be asymptomatic or may cause disease. Depending on factors related to the specific virus and the infected host, disease can range from conjunctivitis or mild flu-like symptoms to severe acute respiratory disease or even death. Gastrointestinal or neurological symptoms have been reported but these are rare.Human cases of infection with avian influenza viruses are usually the result of direct or indirect exposure to infected live or dead poultry or contaminated environments.",
        "Public Health Response": "The Chinese government has taken the following monitoring, prevention, and control measures:Enhanced monitoring and disinfection in the surrounding environment of the patient\u2019s residence and suspected exposure areas;Public risk communication activities to improve public awareness and adoption of self-protection measures.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Avian influenza A(H3N8) viruses are commonly detected globally in animals. Influenza A(H3N8) viruses are some of the most commonly found subtypes in birds, causing little to no sign of disease in either domestic poultry or wild birds. Cross-species transmission of A(H3N8) avian influenza viruses has been reported for various mammal species, including being endemic in dogs and horses. This is the third reported human infection with A(H3N8) from China. Two previous cases were reported in April and May 2022. One of the previous cases developed a critical illness, while the other had a mild illness. Both cases likely acquired infection from direct or indirect exposure to infected poultry. So far, no additional cases linked with this case, nor the previous cases, have been reported. According to reports from health officials, the preliminary epidemiological investigation into this event suggests that exposure to a live poultry market may have been the cause of infection. However, it is still unclear what the exact source of this infection is and how this virus is related to other avian influenza A(H3N8) viruses that are circulating in animals. To better understand the current risk to public health, more information is needed from both human and animal investigation.The transmission of avian influenza viruses from birds to humans is usually sporadic and happens in a specific context: most human infections with avian influenza viruses that have been reported previously were due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. Since avian influenza viruses continue to be detected in poultry populations, further sporadic human cases are expected in the future. The available epidemiological and virological information suggests that avian influenza A(H3N8) viruses do not have the capacity for sustained transmission among humans. Therefore, the current assessment is that the likelihood of human-to-human spread is low. However, due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect virologic, epidemiologic and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses which may affect human (or animal) health.",
        "WHO Advice": "To minimize the risk of infection, countries should increase public awareness of the importance of avoiding contact with high-risk environments such as live animal markets/farms, live poultry, or surfaces that may be contaminated by poultry or bird faeces. It is recommended to maintain good hand hygiene by frequently washing hands or using alcohol-based hand sanitizer and wearing respiratory protection when in a risky environment.Given the observed extent and frequency of avian influenza cases in wild birds and some wild mammals, the public should avoid contact with animals that are sick or dead from unknown causes and should report the occurrence to the authorities. Travellers to countries with known outbreaks of animal influenza should avoid farms, contact with animals in live animal markets, entering areas where animals may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with animal faeces or other body fluids. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water and follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.WHO advises against the application of travel or trade restrictions based on the information available at this time. Influenza viruses are constantly evolving and large outbreaks occur among animal populations, which is why WHO stresses the importance of global surveillance to detect any changes in virology, epidemiology, and clinical patterns associated with emerging or circulating influenza viruses, which may pose a threat to human or animal health. Collaboration between the animal and human health sectors is essential. As the extent of influenza viruses circulation in animals is not clear, epidemiologic and virologic surveillance and the follow-up of suspected human cases should continue systematically. Timely sharing of information is critical for risk assessment. The variety of zoonotic influenza viruses that have led to human infections is worrying and demands increased surveillance in both animal and human populations, as well as a comprehensive examination of each zoonotic infection, and planning for pandemics. To prevent a viral mutation that could make human-to-human transmission easier, poultry workers have been recommended to receive seasonal influenza vaccination. If a human infection with a novel influenza virus that has pandemic potential, such as avian influenza, is confirmed or suspected, even before receiving confirmatory laboratory results, \u00a0contact tracing should be immediately initiated. A thorough epidemiological investigation should be conducted, including a history of travel and exposure to animals . The investigation should also involve early identification of unusual clusters of respiratory disease that could indicate person-to-person transmission of the novel virus. Clinical samples collected from the time and place that the case occurred should be tested, and then sent to a WHO Collaborating Centre for further characterization.Close analysis of the epidemiological situation, further characterization of the most recent viruses found in humans and poultry, and serological investigations, are critical to assess risk and to adjust risk management measures in a timely manner.Under the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005), States Parties are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of human infection caused by a new subtype of influenza virus. Investigation, virus sharing, and genetic and antigenic characterization of every human infection are essential.This event does not change the current recommendations from WHO for public health measures and surveillance of influenza.",

        "Date Reported": "11 April 2023",
        "Location": "Togo",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "Since mid-December 2022, Togo has been responding to a meningitis outbreak that has so far resulted in a total of 141 cases and 12 deaths (CFR 8.5%), with almost half of the cases affecting children and young adults between 10 and 19 years of age. Overall, 22 samples have been confirmed as Streptococcus pneumoniae.\nTogo is located in the African meningitis belt, with seasonal outbreaks recurring every year. However, the current outbreak is concerning due to different concomitant factors, including the security crisis in the Sahel which causes population movements, and suboptimal surveillance capacity. This is also the country\u2019s first time dealing with a pneumococcal meningitis outbreak.\nAn incident management system has been established to coordinate the outbreak response activities, and WHO is supporting the shipment of antibiotics (ceftriaxone) to improve case management.\nWHO assesses the overall risk posed by this outbreak as high at the national level, moderate at the regional level, and low at the global level.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 15 February 2023, the Ministry of Health of Togo officially declared a meningitis outbreak in Oti Sud district, Savanes region, in the northern part of the country. From 19 December 2022 to 2 April 2023, a total of 141 suspected cases of meningitis with 12 deaths (CFR 8.5%) have been reported from Oti Sud district, corresponding to an attack rate of 112 per 100 000 population.Figure 1. Number of reported meningitis cases and deaths, 19 December 2022 (week 51 of 2022) to 2 April 2023 (week 13 of 2023), Oti Sud district, Savanes region, Togo. A total of 118 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were collected from suspected cases, of which 22 were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and culture for Streptococcus pneumoniae at the national reference laboratory (81 samples were negative and the results for 15 samples are pending).The most affected age group is 10\u201319 years (47%; n = 66), followed by the \u226530-year age group with 20% (n = 28) of cases, and the 20-29 year age group with 15% (n = 22) of cases. There is no difference in the case distribution by gender, with 71 (53%) cases reported among males.Togo introduced the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugated vaccine (PCV13) in 2014, which is currently administered in three doses at the first, second and third months of life. The administrative PCV13 coverage in the Savanes region is 100% for the third dose, but the immunization history is not available for the individual cases, and it is not known if the serotype(s) involved are covered by the vaccine. Additionally, the most affected age groups were born before the PCV13 introduction in 2014 and could have not received the vaccine.",
        "Epidemiology": "Meningitis is a devastating disease with a high case fatality rate and serious long-term complications (sequelae). It remains a major global public-health challenge. Many organisms can cause bacterial meningitis.\u00a0Neisseria meningitidis,\u00a0Streptococcus pneumoniae, and\u00a0Haemophilus influenzae\u00a0type b constitute the majority of all cases of bacterial meningitis and 90% of bacterial meningitis in children. It is estimated that about one million children die of pneumococcal disease every year.Streptococcus pneumoniae\u00a0is an encapsulated bacterium, and about 90 distinct pneumococcal serotypes have been identified throughout the world, with a small number of these serotypes being able to cause disease. Pneumococci are transmitted by direct contact with respiratory secretions from patients and healthy carriers. Serious pneumococcal infections include pneumonia, meningitis and febrile bacteraemia; otitis media, sinusitis and bronchitis are more common but less serious manifestations. The incubation period is two to 10 days. Pneumococcal meningitis has a high case fatality rate (36%\u201366%) in the African meningitis belt, requires longer treatment than meningococcal meningitis, and is more frequently associated with severe sequelae.Diagnosis of bacterial meningitis typically requires lumbar puncture. In the absence of lumbar puncture, diagnosis can only be suspected through clinical examination (but not confirmed, except with a positive blood culture). Culture and PCR are confirmatory tests for bacterial meningitis. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) can support the diagnosis but are not confirmatory. Identification of serotypes or serogroups and susceptibility to antibiotics are important to define control measures. Molecular typing and whole genome sequencing can identify additional differences between strains and inform public health responses.A range of antibiotics is used to treat meningitis, including penicillin, ampicillin, and ceftriaxone. During epidemics of meningococcal and pneumococcal meningitis, ceftriaxone is the drug of choice. Nevertheless, pneumococcal resistance to antimicrobials is a serious and rapidly increasing problem worldwide.Two classes of pneumococcal vaccines are currently available. Conjugate vaccines are effective from six weeks of age at preventing meningitis and other severe pneumococcal infections and are recommended for infants and children up to the age of five years, and in some countries for adults aged over 65 years, as well as individuals from certain risk groups. Two different conjugate vaccines are in use that protects against 10 and 13 serotypes, respectively. New conjugate vaccines designed to protect against more pneumococcal serotypes are either in development or have been approved for use in adults. Conjugate vaccines are also effective in preventing nasopharyngeal carriage. A polysaccharide vaccine against 23 serotypes is available but, as for other polysaccharide vaccines, this type of vaccine is considered less effective than conjugate vaccines. It is used mostly in those aged over 65 years to protect against pneumonia, as well as in individuals from certain risk groups. It is not used in children under two years of age and is less useful in protecting against meningitis.",
        "Public Health Response": "An incident management system has been established to coordinate the outbreak response activities, and coordination meetings are held weekly. The national outbreak response plan has been developed and validated. Under the leadership of WHO, cross-border meetings are ongoing with Benin and Ghana to share information about outbreak response activities and strengthen preparedness and readiness.Health facility managers, community health workers, community relay agents (social workers) and community leaders are being trained on meningitis. Radio spots are broadcasted regarding community-based surveillance and the importance of early healthcare-seeking. Active case finding is being conducted in health facilities and in the community. Outbreak situation reports are developed by the Ministry of Health with the support of WHO and disseminated to stakeholders involved in response activities.WHO has procured and distributed cerebrospinal fluid sample collection and transportation materials to the health facilities in the affected areas. WHO is supporting the shipment of antibiotics (ceftriaxone) to improve case management. There are ongoing efforts to facilitate the shipment of the samples for further serotyping at the regional reference laboratory. WHO is also supporting the mobilization of resources for the implementation of the response plan.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Togo is part of the African meningitis belt and annually records meningitis cases and deaths. Although the country has experience in the management of meningococcal meningitis outbreaks over the past years, the current Streptococcus pneumoniae outbreak is unusual as the country has never managed a pneumococcal meningitis outbreak in the past, and national capacity is limited.\u00a0 To date, no imported cases have been reported in neighbouring countries. However, several factors are likely to increase the risk of spread, including the country's location in the African meningitis belt; the epidemic season, which typically runs from January to June; constraints in the provision of vaccination services, which do not allow for optimal vaccination coverage to protect the population; the fact that the main age groups affected by the outbreak are not protected by the routine vaccination against Streptococcus pneumoniae introduced in Togo in 2014; the security crisis in the Sahel, affecting the Savanes region, hampering public health interventions and causing population movements; the precarious economic conditions in the country, particularly in the Savanes region; and the suboptimal surveillance capacity for early case detection, diagnosis and treatment in the Oti Sud district.\u00a0Neighbouring countries are also in the African meningitis belt, and the Oti Sud district borders Ghana and Benin, making it possible for the disease to spread to other countries in the region.Considering the above-described situation, WHO assesses the overall risk posed by this outbreak as high at the national level, moderate at the regional level, and low at the global level.",
        "WHO Advice": "Early diagnosis and appropriate case management are essential, given the high case fatality and risk of developing sequelae due to pneumococcal meningitis. Prompt antibiotic treatment should be ensured for a duration of 10-14 days. Active community-based case-finding and community engagement should be implemented to inform the communities of the signs of meningitis and the importance of early diagnosis and treatment. The collection of detailed epidemiological and microbiological data, including serotyping, is essential to inform the pneumococcal meningitis control strategy.Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines are effective in preventing meningitis and other serious pneumococcal infections. To date, the available data do not support recommendations for reactive vaccination campaigns against pneumococcal meningitis outbreaks. Recommendations for the use of pneumococcal vaccine in community outbreak settings were discussed by the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) in October 2020, with one main conclusion being that more research and evidence gathering was needed from countries of the African meningitis belt, in order to develop a strategy for pneumococcal meningitis outbreak prevention and response.WHO, with the support of many partners, has developed a Global Roadmap to defeat meningitis by 2030. Concerted actions to achieve this goal are organized around five interrelated pillars:Prevention and epidemic control by developing new affordable vaccines, achieving high immunization coverage, improving prevention strategies, and responding to epidemics;Diagnosis and treatment through rapid confirmation of meningitis cases and optimal patient management;Meningitis surveillance to guide prevention and control;Management of those affected by meningitis through early case detection and improved access to management of complications; andAdvocacy and engagement to ensure high awareness of meningitis, promote country commitment and affirm the right to prevention, care, and follow-up services.Based on the information currently available on this outbreak, WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions for Togo.",

        "Outbreak name": "Human infection caused by Avian Influenza A (H5)",
        "Date Reported": "6 April 2023",
        "Location": "Chile",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 29 March 2023, the Ministry of Health of Chile notified WHO of a laboratory-confirmed case of human infection caused by avian influenza A(H5) virus in the Region of Antofagasta. This is the first human infection with avian influenza A(H5) virus reported in Chile and the third reported in the Region of the Americas to date. This is a single human infection, and no further case has been identified so far. An outbreak investigation is ongoing including determining the exposure of the case to the virus. In recent months of 2023, unprecedented outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) in animals have been reported from Chile. Avian Influenza A(H5N1) viruses have been detected among backyard poultry, farm poultry, wild birds, and sea mammals.\nAvian influenza infection in a human can cause severe disease and is notifiable under the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005)[1].",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 29 March 2023, the Ministry of Health of Chile notified WHO of the detection of human infection with avian influenza A(H5) virus, confirmed by the Institute of Public Health of Chile (ISP per its acronym in Spanish), which is the National Influenza Centre. The patient is a 53-year-old male from the Region of Antofagasta in the north of Chile. He had no history of comorbidities or recent travel.On 13 March 2023, he developed symptoms including cough, sore throat, and hoarseness. On 21 March, due to worsening symptoms, he sought care at a local hospital. On 22 March 2023, the case developed dyspnea and was admitted to a Regional Hospital at Antofagasta. A nasopharyngeal swab sample was collected as part of routine severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) surveillance and tested negative for COVID-19 by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). On 23 March, he was admitted to the intensive care unit. On 24 March, treatment with antivirals (oseltamivir) and antibiotics was initiated. He remains in respiratory isolation under multidisciplinary management, with mechanical ventilation due to pneumonia.\u00a0\u00a0On 27 March, a bronchoalveolar sample was collected and tested positive for an unsubtypeable influenza A virus by RT-PCR. The sample was sent to the ISP and tested positive for avian influenza A(H5) on 29 March. The neuraminidase type is yet to be confirmed and the clade information for the avian influenza A(H5) virus detected in this human case is not yet known. The NIC has forwarded the patient's samples to a WHO Collaborating Centre for further characterization.\u00a0Three close contacts of the case were asymptomatic and tested negative for influenza and have concluded the monitoring period. Additionally, a total of nine contacts among health care workers were identified, all concluded the monitoring on 4 April, however on 5 April one of them developed respiratory symptoms, therefore, further testing is ongoing, and the period of monitoring was extended for 7 more days for this contact of the case. Avian influenza A (H5N1) was first detected in the Americas in birds in December 2014. Between December 2022 and February 2023, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) was detected in wild aquatic birds (pelicans and penguins) and sea mammals (sea lions) in the Antofagasta Region where the case resides. According to preliminary findings of the epidemiological investigation of this human case, the most plausible route of transmission was through environmental exposure in areas close to the residence of the case where either sick or dead sea mammals or wild birds were found.",
        "Epidemiology": "Zoonotic influenza infections in humans may range from asymptomatic or mild upper respiratory infection (fever and cough) to rapid progression to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, shock, and death, depending on factors related to the virus and the host. Rarely, gastrointestinal, or neurological symptoms have been reported. Human cases of avian influenza are usually the result of direct or indirect exposure to infected live or dead poultry or contaminated environments.In the Region of the Americas during 2022 and 2023, an increasing number of outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5) have been reported in backyard poultry, farm poultry, wild birds, and wild mammals. Since the first confirmation of avian influenza A(H5N1) in the region in 2014, three human infections caused by avian influenza A(H5) have been reported: the first in the United States of America, reported in April 2022; the second in Ecuador, reported in January 2023; and this case. Globally, since 2003, 873 human infections, including 458 deaths (CFR 52%), with A(H5N1) viruses have been reported to WHO. Additionally, three human infections with influenza A (H5[2]) viruses, 84 human cases of infection with A(H5N6) viruses, and seven human cases of infection with A(H5N8) viruses have been reported to WHO.",
        "Public Health Response": "Local authorities are carrying out an epidemiological investigation and conducting contact tracing amongst family members and healthcare workers.\u00a0Intersectoral activities have been carried out by the Ministry of Health of Chile, the Agriculture and Livestock Service of the Ministry of Agriculture of Chile, and the National Fisheries and Aquaculture Service of Chile, among others, in order to follow up on the avian influenza outbreaks in the area.\u00a0\u00a0Active follow-up is being conducted of persons with respiratory symptoms and exposure to wild birds, poultry, and mammals; as well as cases with suspected influenza due to contact with poultry or who have been exposed to birds. Seasonal influenza vaccination is being conducted in risk groups according to the guidelines of the National Immunization Program.\u00a0The population has been informed, through messaging for different target audiences, about the case and about prevention measures.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "According to the preliminary findings of the local epidemiological investigation, the most plausible hypothesis about transmission is that it occurred through environmental exposure to areas where either sick or dead birds or sea mammals were found close to the residence of the case. According to the information received thus far, the virus has not been detected in other individuals.Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, wild birds or mammals, there is a risk for sporadic infection and small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected animals or contaminated environments.Public health measures have been implemented by both the human and animal health agencies, including monitoring healthcare workers and other contacts of the laboratory-confirmed case. While further characterization of the virus from this human case is pending, currently available epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that A(H5) viruses have not acquired the capacity for sustained transmission among humans, thus the likelihood of human-to-human spread is low. Based on available information, WHO assesses the risk to the general population posed by this virus to be low. Should infected individuals from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during travel or after arrival. If this were to occur, further community-level spread is considered unlikely as this virus has not acquired the ability to transmit easily among humans.The preliminary risk assessment will be reviewed as needed should further epidemiological or virological information become available.",
        "WHO Advice": "Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, and the large outbreaks among animal populations, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect and monitor virological, epidemiological, and clinical changes associated with emerging or circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health, and of timely virus sharing for risk assessment. The diversity of zoonotic influenza viruses that have caused human infections is alarming and necessitates strengthened surveillance in both animal and human populations, thorough investigation of every zoonotic infection, and pandemic preparedness planning. Vaccination of poultry workers with seasonal influenza vaccine has been advised to prevent a viral mutation that could facilitate human-to-human transmission. WHO does not advise special traveler screening at points of entry. \u00a0In the case of a confirmed or suspected human infection (even while awaiting the confirmatory laboratory results) with a novel influenza virus with pandemic potential, including avian influenza and variant viruses, contact tracing should be initiated and a thorough epidemiologic investigation of history of exposure to animals and of travel should be conducted. The epidemiologic investigation should include early identification of unusual clusters of respiratory events that could signal person-to-person transmission of the novel virus, and clinical samples collected from the time and place that the case occurred should be tested and then sent to a WHO Collaborating Centre for further characterization.There are no approved vaccines for preventing influenza A(H5) in humans. Candidate vaccine viruses to prevent influenza A(H5) infection in humans have been developed for pandemic preparedness purposes.Given the observed extent and frequency of avian influenza cases in wild birds and some wild mammals, the public should avoid contact with animals that are sick or dead from unknown causes and should report the occurrence to the authorities. Travelers to countries with known outbreaks of animal influenza should avoid farms, contact with animals in live animal markets, entering areas where animals may be slaughtered, or contact with\u00a0any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with animal faeces or other body fluids. Travelers should also wash their hands often with soap and water and follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices. Close analysis of the epidemiological situation, further characterization of the most recent viruses found in humans and poultry, and serological investigations, are critical to assess risk and to adjust risk management measures in a timely manner.All human infections caused by a novel influenza subtype are notifiable under the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005), and States Parties to the IHR are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic. Evidence of illness is not required for this notification.",

        "Description of the Situation": "On 7 March 2023, the National IHR Focal Point (NFP) for Germany notified WHO of five cases of iatrogenic botulism in individuals who underwent medical procedures with the injection of botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT/A) in health institutions in T\u00fcrkiye.\u00a0 As of 17 March 2023, a total of 71 clinical botulism cases were reported from T\u00fcrkiye (53 cases), Germany (16 cases), Austria (one case) and Switzerland (one case) linked to the aforementioned medical interventions performed in T\u00fcrkiye between 22 February and 1 March 2023.All cases are adults; most cases are middle-aged women. Among the 69 cases for which treatment location information is known, two private hospitals in two locations in T\u00fcrkiye were identified, with 66 cases linked to one hospital and three cases to another hospital.The clinical presentation of the cases ranged from mild to severe. Clinical signs of BoNT intoxication were observed (including fatigue, headache, blurred and/or double vision, dizziness, ptosis, dysphagia, dyspnea, neck weakness, generalized muscle weakness, and swollen tongue). Several cases were hospitalized. Some cases were treated with botulinum antitoxin. At least five cases were admitted to intensive care units. There are no reported deaths.Investigations carried out by Turkish authorities reported that licensed BoNT products were administered for a different purpose other than for which the products were approved (off-label use). The relevant departments of both hospitals had their activities suspended on 1 March 2023, and investigations have been launched against the parties involved.\u00a0 The products used for the treatment were seized and taken for examination and evaluation by the Turkish Medicines and Medical Devices Agency. No new symptomatic cases have been reported since 8 March 2023, which was the date of symptom onset for the last reported case.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "The Turkish Ministry of Health is working with the T\u00fcrkish Medicines and Medical Devices Agency and the Turkish National Poison Solidarity Center to investigate this event. The Turkish General Directorate of Public Health, Department of Communicable Diseases and Early Warning. is conducting an epidemiological investigation with provincial health centres and related departments. The relevant units of the Ministry of Health and the Turkish Police Service urgently inspected the two hospitals mentioned above. The investigation is currently ongoing to determine if the cause of the intoxication is due to product quality/safety, medical error, or an overdose.WHO is collaborating with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), and the affected IHR State Parties, regarding investigation, risk assessment, information sharing and response for this event.The Turkish Medicines and Medical Devices Agency published an announcement on its website on 10 March 2023. Similarly, the ECDC announced the current situation regarding this event in their publicly-available Communicable Disease Threats Report on 10 March 2023, and a news story was published on the ECDC website on 14 March 2023.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Botulinum neurotoxins are dangerous toxins produced by several species of the genus Clostridium (e.g.,\u00a0C. botulinum,\u00a0C. baratii,\u00a0C. butyricum, and\u00a0C. sporogenes) under anaerobic conditions. Botulinum neurotoxins are one of the most lethal substances known and occur in eight serotypes (A to H). Botulinum neurotoxins block nerve functions and can lead to muscular, including respiratory, paralysis. Human botulism is a naturally occurring rare disease and may refer to foodborne botulism, infant botulism, wound botulism, and inhalation botulism. Clostridium botulinum culture is used to produce pharmaceutical botulinum toxin-containing products. These pharmaceutical products employ the purified and heavily diluted botulinum neurotoxin (type A or type B, depending on the indication) injected for clinical use for the treatment of more than 20 neurological and non-neurological disorders, as well as for cosmetic use. Treatment is administered in the medical setting, tailored according to the needs of the patient and desired treatment effect. The symptoms of botulism can be very severe, requiring intensive-care treatment as well as the administration of specific anti-toxins. Even when such treatments are available, severe botulism cases require supportive treatment, including mechanical ventilation. Complete recovery usually takes weeks to months.This current event is possibly linked to a specific procedure and/or a medical product in at least two healthcare settings. Further investigations are ongoing regarding case ascertainment and notification. The investigation remains open for other possible hypotheses of intoxication. The respective departments in the two clinics where the procedures were undertaken have been closed since 1 March, with no further cases reported.There are several clinical indications for the use of botulinum neurotoxin; however, its off-label use in bariatric cases has increased in many countries. Depending on the product used, a warning of toxic effects may be insufficiently worded, and the risks not adequately addressed in the patient consent process.",
        "WHO Advice": "Botulism outbreaks are rare, but outbreaks require rapid recognition to identify the source of the disease, distinguish between types of outbreaks (natural, accidental or potentially deliberate), prevent additional cases, and effectively administer treatment to affected patients.Successful treatment depends significantly on early diagnosis and the rapid administration of the botulinum antitoxins. Iatrogenic botulism should be suspected if a patient has recently received botulinum neurotoxin, and clinicians should remain mindful of the risk of systemic botulism with BoNT therapy. The diagnostic detection of BoNT/A in patients suffering from iatrogenic botulism might be highly challenging due to the extremely low dose of toxin present and the potentially suboptimal timepoint of serum sampling. So far, very few detection methods have been shown to be validated on clinical specimens with a sensitivity better than the classical mouse bioassay, which is still regarded as a reference for BoNT detection in clinical samples. At this time, it cannot\u00a0be confirmed if the reported cases of botulism intoxication are due to product quality/safety, medical error, or an overdose.Although the source of the outbreak may have been removed, WHO Member States need to remain vigilant. It is therefore critically important for the IHR State Parties to identify any additional possible case, to establish the cause, and to determine if the product used in the procedure could be substandard or falsified. Investigation of these cases will assist in rapid containment at the disease source to prevent additional possible cases.WHO does not recommend any travel and/or trade restrictions to T\u00fcrkiye based on the information available for this event.",

        "Outbreak name": "Marburg virus disease",
        "Date Reported": "24 March 2023",
        "Location": "United Republic of Tanzania",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 21 March 2023, the Ministry of Health (MoH) of the United Republic of Tanzania declared an outbreak of Marburg virus disease (MVD) in the country. As of 22 March, a total of eight cases, including five deaths (case fatality ratio [CFR]: 62.5%) have been reported from two villages in Bukoba district, Kagera region, United Republic of Tanzania. Two of these cases were healthcare workers, one of whom has died. This is the first Marburg virus disease outbreak reported in the country.\nAs response measures, Rapid Response Teams have been deployed to investigate and implement interventions in the affected areas, including contact tracing and risk communication activities. WHO assesses the risk of spread as very high at the national level, high at the subregional level, and moderate at the regional level due to cross-border movements between Kagera region and bordering countries including Uganda in the north, Rwanda and Burundi in the west. The risk at the global level is assessed to be low.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 16 March 2023, the MoH of the United Republic of Tanzania announced that seven cases and five deaths from an unknown disease had been reported in two villages in Bukoba district, Kagera region, northern Tanzania. The cases were later confirmed as Marburg virus infection by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at the National Public Health Laboratory, Tanzania. On 21 March 2023, the MoH officially declared the first MVD outbreak in the country. As of 22 March, eight cases, including five deaths (case fatality ratio [CFR]: 62.5%) have been reported from Kagera region. The remaining three patients are currently undergoing treatment. As of 22 March, no cases have been reported from outside the Bukoba district of Kagera Region. The first identified case reported travel history from Goziba Island in Lake Victoria in Tanzania and developed symptoms after returning to his village in Bukoba. The case died in the community. Four additional cases were identified from the same family as this index case. Further, two cases were reported among healthcare workers who treated them, one of whom died. No information is available on the eighth case; investigations are ongoing. Reported symptoms of the patients were fever, diarrhoea, vomiting, bleeding from various sites, and kidney failure. Samples from both deceased and live cases were taken and confirmed for Marburg virus by the National Public Health Laboratory.",
        "Epidemiology": "Marburg virus disease is an epidemic-prone disease associated with high case-fatality rates (CFR 24-90%). It is caused by the same family of viruses (Filoviridae) as Ebola virus disease and is clinically similar. The current CFR for this outbreak is relatively high, at 62.5%.Marburg virus infection often results from prolonged exposure to mines or caves inhabited by\u00a0Rousettus\u00a0bat colonies. Once an individual is infected with the virus, it can spread through human-to-human transmission via direct contact with the blood, secretions or other body fluids of infected or deceased people. Healthcare workers have previously been infected while treating patients with suspected or confirmed MVD. Burial ceremonies that involve direct contact with the body of the deceased can also contribute to the transmission of Marburg.The incubation period varies from two to 21 days. Illness caused by Marburg virus begins abruptly, with high fever, severe headache, and severe malaise. Severe watery diarrhoea, abdominal pain and cramping, nausea, and vomiting can begin around the third day. Severe haemorrhagic manifestations may appear between five and seven days from symptom onset, and fatal cases usually have some form of bleeding, often from multiple areas. In fatal cases, death occurs most often between eight and nine days after symptom onset, usually preceded by severe blood loss and shock.Clinical diagnosis of MVD is difficult in the early phase as symptoms are similar to other febrile illnesses. The differential diagnosis for MVD may include other filovirus diseases, Lassa fever, malaria, typhoid fever, dengue, rickettsial infections, leptospirosis and plague.Laboratory confirmation is primarily made by RT-PCR. Other tests can be used such as antibody-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), antigen-capture detection tests, serum neutralization tests, electron microscopy, and virus isolation by cell culture.Although there are no vaccines or antiviral treatments for MVD, supportive care \u2013 such as rehydration with oral or intravenous fluids \u2013 and treatment of specific symptoms improve survival. A range of potential treatments are being evaluated, including blood products, immune therapies, and drug therapies.This is the first time that Tanzania has reported an outbreak of MVD. Even though there is an ongoing outbreak of MVD in Equatorial Guinea (for more details, please see the\u00a0Disease outbreak news published on 22 March), so far there is no evidence of an epidemiological link between the two outbreaks. Other MVD outbreaks have been previously reported in Ghana (2022), Guinea (2021), Uganda (2017, 2014, 2012, 2007), Angola (2004-2005), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (1998 and 2000), Kenya (1990, 1987, 1980) and South Africa (1975).",
        "Public Health Response": "Regional and district-level Rapid Response Teams have been deployed to investigate and implement response measures. Contact tracing activities have been implemented to monitor people with similar symptoms in the community and at health facilities, including contacts of the known cases. A total of 161 contacts have been identified and 140 have been followed up and monitored by health professionals on 21 March. Risk communication activities have also been initiated in the Kagera Region to provide health awareness education and prevention messages.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "The United Republic of Tanzania has reported its first outbreak of MVD, which is a highly virulent disease, with a fatality ratio of up to 90%. The affected region, Kagera, borders three countries (Uganda to the north, and Rwanda and Burundi to the west) and Lake Victoria, and cross-border population movements may increase the risk of disease spread. In addition, Marburg virus has been isolated from fruit bats (Roussettus aegyptiacus) in Tanzania and countries neighboring the affected Kagera region, therefore, the same bat species may carry the virus in this region. Due to the high CFR and existing risk of spread of the outbreak to other areas of the country, inadequate human, financial and material resources to implement response interventions, and the likelihood of existing capacities being overwhelmed if the cases increase, the risk at the national level is assessed as very high.  Following the recent Ebola virus outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo from 23 April - 3 July 2022 and from 21 August - 27 September 2022, and Sudan ebolavirus outbreak in Uganda from 20 September 2022 to 11 January 2023, neighbouring countries in the subregion, including the United Republic of Tanzania, have been building preparedness capacities against filovirus diseases. In the West African region, an outbreak of MVD was declared on 13 February 2023 in Equatorial Guinea and is ongoing.  Based on the available information, the risk is considered as high at the subregional level, moderate at the regional level and low at the global level.",
        "WHO Advice": "Human-to-human transmission of Marburg virus is primarily associated with direct contact with the blood and/or other bodily fluids of infected people. Marburg virus transmission associated with health care services has been reported in previous outbreaks when appropriate infection control measures were not or were inadequately implemented.Healthcare workers caring for patients with confirmed or suspected MVD should apply additional infection prevention and control \u00a0measures in addition to standard precautions, to avoid contact with patients' blood and other body fluids and with contaminated surfaces and objects.Surveillance and detection activities, including contact tracing and active case finding, should be strengthened in all affected health zones. Measures to contain outbreaks of MVD include prompt safe and dignified burial of the deceased, identification of people who may have been in contact with someone infected with Marburg virus and monitoring their condition for 21 days, separation of healthy and sick people to prevent further transmission and care for confirmed patients, and maintenance of good hygiene and a clean environment.Raising awareness of the risk factors for Marburg infection and the protective measures that individuals can take to reduce human exposure to the virus are key measures to reduce human infections and deaths.WHO encourages all countries to ship samples (positive or negative) to a WHO Collaborating Center for confirmation.Based on the current risk assessment, WHO advises against any travel and trade restrictions with the United Republic of Tanzania.",

        "Location": "South Africa",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "Sporadic cases of measles were reported in South Africa throughout 2022. In epidemiological week 40 in 2022 (ending 8 October 2022) an outbreak was declared in Limpopo province. As of 16 March 2023, confirmed cases have been reported from all provinces; eight out of nine South African provinces have declared measles outbreaks1. No deaths associated with measles have been recorded. Most cases (86%) are reported among those aged under 14 years.\nCommunity-based surveillance has been strengthened and the Ministry of Health (MoH) is conducting a mass measles vaccination campaign targeting children aged between 6 months and 15 years in all provinces.\nWHO assesses the risk posed by the current outbreak as high at the national level, moderate at the regional level and low at the global level.",
        "Description of the Situation": "South Africa is a measles-endemic country, with several measles outbreaks reported in recent years. Sporadic cases were reported in all nine provinces in South Africa in 2022. As of 4 March 2023, measles outbreaks were declared in eight provinces, further to the outbreak which was declared in Limpopo province in October 2022 (Figure 1).Figure 1: Epidemiological curve of laboratory-confirmed measles cases in South Africa from week 40, 2022 to week 10, 2023 Source: NICD South African Measles Outbreak 2023 Update 16 MarchFrom epidemiological week 40, 2022 (ending 8 October 2022) to week 10, 2023 (ending 4 March 2023), the National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD) tested 4830 serum samples for measles, of which 772 (16%) were confirmed measles cases (Figure 2). Figure 2: Number of serum samples tested by NICD and positivity rate (%) in South Africa, week 40 of 2022 to week 10 of 2023The 772 laboratory-confirmed measles cases were reported from the provinces of: Limpopo (275; 36%), North West (198; 26%), Gauteng (124; 16%), Mpumalanga (106; 14%), Free State (28; 3.5%), KwaZulu-Natal (17; 2%), Western Cape (11; 1.5%), Northern Cape (7; 1%) and Eastern Cape (6; 1%) (Figure 3). Figure 3: Geographical distribution of laboratory-confirmed measles cases in South Africa, week 40 of 2022 (ending 8 October 2022) to week 10 of 2023 (ending 4 March 2023)The age of laboratory-confirmed measles cases ranges from two months to 60 years. The majority of cases (42%) are in the age group 5-9 years, followed by the age groups 1-4 years (25%) and 10-14 years (19%). The attack rates (per 100 000 population) are highest among age groups 1-4 years (4.7 / 100 000) and 5-9 years (6.6 / 100 000).Out of the laboratory-confirmed cases, 80 (10%) were vaccinated with at least one dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV), 92 (12%) were unvaccinated, and the vaccination status of 570 (79.1%) is unknown.According to the South African National Department of Health (NDOH), national immunization coverage of the measles-containing vaccine first dose (MCV1) and second dose (MCV2) was estimated at 87% and 82% respectively in 2021, while in 2022 the respective coverage was 86% and 86%. However, historical vaccination coverage has been low, which may be contributing to the current resurgence. According to WHO-UNICEF estimates, in 2018, MCV1 coverage averaged 81% and MCV2 75%. In 2017, MCV1 and MCV2 coverage was estimated at 81% and 78%.",
        "Epidemiology": "Measles is caused by a virus in the paramyxovirus family. The virus infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body. Measles is a human disease and is not known to occur in animals. It can lead to major epidemics with significant morbidity and mortality, especially among vulnerable people. Among young and malnourished children, pregnant women and immunocompromised individuals, including those with HIV, cancer or treated with immunosuppressives, measles can cause serious complications, including ear infection, severe diarrhea, blindness, encephalitis, pneumonia, and death.Transmission is primarily person-to-person by airborne respiratory droplets that disperse rapidly when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Transmission can also occur through direct contact with infected secretions. Transmission from asymptomatic exposed immune persons has not been demonstrated. The virus remains active and contagious in the air or on infected surfaces for up to two hours. A patient is infectious from four days before the start of the rash to four days after its appearance. There is no specific antiviral treatment for measles and most people recover within 2-3 weeks.An effective and safe vaccine is available for prevention and control. The measles-containing vaccine first dose (MCV1) is given at the age of nine months, while the second dose of the measles-containing second dose (MCV2) is given at the age of 15 months. A 95% population coverage of MCV1 and MCV2 is required to stop measles circulation.In areas with low vaccination coverage, epidemics typically occur every two to three years and usually last between two and three months, although their duration varies according to population size, crowding, and the population\u2019s immunity status.South Africa has had several outbreaks in recent years. Between 2003 and 2005, an outbreak occurred with 1676 cases reported. In 2009-2010, a large outbreak occurred with 18 431 documented cases. In 2017, a small outbreak was declared in Western Cape, Gauteng, and Kwazulu-Natal provinces, with a total of 186 cases. In 2019, a cluster of measles cases was reported in Cape Town affecting four siblings with a travel history to a measles-affected country.",
        "Public Health Response": "The Ministry of Health has implemented the costed national measles response plan with the support of WHO. The NDOH is conducting a mass measles vaccination campaign in all provinces, targeting children aged 6 months - 15 years. WHO staff have been deployed to support all aspects of the response: coordination; information management and surveillance; case management; supplies and logistics; and risk communication and community engagement.Other response activities include: Active case search, investigation and line listing of fever and rash cases;Weekly measles incident management support team (IMST) meeting conducted with all provinces;Weekly interim situation reports based on the results of laboratory tests being issued by the NDOH and NICD;Deployment of provincial and district rapid response teams (RRTs) to affected neighbourhoods;Training in preparation for the national immunization campaign, completed in all provinces;A local vaccination campaign targeting children aged 6 months to 5 years, conducted in Limpopo province;Training health workers on measles case identification and supportive case management to prevent measles complications and mortalityStrengthening of community-based surveillance for early detection of cases using community health volunteers, with support from WHO;Raising community awareness via community health workers;Mapping of partners and resources to support the outbreak response, supported by WHO and partners.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Four of the provinces affected by the current outbreak (Limpopo, Mpumalanga, Northwest, and KwaZulu-Natal) border Zimbabwe, Botswana and Mozambique. The cross-border movement of populations across the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region2 and the weak disease surveillance health systems in many SADC countries pose a threat for further international spread.There is an ongoing measles outbreak in neighboring Zimbabwe. Response capacities in the region are also constrained due to the concurrent readiness and response efforts to COVID-19, cholera, mpox, wild poliovirus, floods and cyclones.Based on the currently available information, the overall risk of measles in South Africa is assessed as high for the following reasons:The current measles outbreak has been declared in eight out of nine provinces, and cases have been confirmed in all provinces, with further spread likely due to a highly mobile population; The 2022 measles risk assessment reported 86% of districts as having medium to high risk for measles, based on the WHO measles risk assessment tool; Suboptimal national measles vaccination coverage (in 2022, the coverage was 86% for both MCV1 and MCV2, which is below the required coverage of 95% to achieve population herd immunity and thus prevent sustained transmission);The presence of high rates of HIV/AIDS and TB, which can worsen the clinical picture of measles, in the South African population;Floods reported in seven provinces, which have rendered sections of the population inaccessible during the ongoing measles vaccination campaign;The need for technical and logistical support to provinces, as most essential services and programs (including immunization) were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and are only now recovering from its devastating impact.",
        "WHO Advice": "Although measles is highly contagious, an effective and safe vaccine is available for prevention and control. MCV1 is given at the age of 9 months in countries with both ongoing transmission and a high risk of measles mortality among infants. These countries should administer the routine MCV2 at the age of 15-18 months. However, in South Africa, MCV1 is given at 6 months and MCV2 is given at 12 months3. A 95% population coverage of MCV1 and MCV2 is required to stop measles circulation. Reaching all children with two doses of the measles vaccine is recommended to ensure immunity and prevent outbreaks, as about 15% of vaccinated children fail to develop immunity from the first dose.Routine vaccination of children against measles, combined with mass immunization campaigns in countries with high morbidity and mortality rates, are key public health strategies to reduce burden and transmission.There is no specific treatment for measles. Case management of measles focuses on supportive care as well as the prevention and treatment of measles complications and secondary infections. Since measles is highly contagious, patient isolation is an important intervention to prevent the further spread of the virus.Oral rehydration salts should be used as needed to prevent dehydration. All children diagnosed with measles should receive two doses of vitamin A oral supplements, given 24 hours apart, irrespective of the timing of previous doses of vitamin A; 50 000 international units (IU) should be given to infants aged < 6 months, 100 000 IU to infants aged 6-11 months and 200 000 IU to children aged 12 months. This treatment restores low vitamin A levels in acute measles cases that occur even in well-nourished children, and can help prevent eye damage and blindness. Vitamin A supplements have also been shown to reduce the number of measles deaths.Nutritional support is recommended to reduce the risk of malnutrition due to diarrhoea, vomiting and poor appetite associated with measles. Breastfeeding should be encouraged where appropriate.In unimmunized or insufficiently immunized individuals, the measles vaccine may be administered within 72 hours of exposure to the measles virus to protect against disease. If the disease does subsequently develop, symptoms are usually less severe, and the duration of illness may be shortened.WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel or trade to or from South Africa.",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 2 January 2023, an outbreak of measles was confirmed in Nepalgunj sub-metropolitan city (SMC) in Banke district, Nepal, following a cluster of cases of fever and rash. Following the confirmation and through active case search, the index case was identified, with the onset of symptoms on 24 November 2022. Between 24 November 2022 and 10 March 2023, 690 measles cases, including one associated death (case fatality ratio: 0.14 %), have been reported from seven districts in western Nepal, and three districts in eastern Nepal (mainly in the Terai ecological region). The majority of the cases (n=591; 86%) have been reported in children aged less than 15 years.\nWhile measles is endemic in Nepal and is reported every year, the magnitude and extent of the current outbreak are unusually high compared to the previous years. Only sporadic isolated measles cases have occurred since 2004, when a substantial outbreak of over 12 000 cases was reported. The risk of spread of measles is assessed as high at the national level and moderate at regional level, due to the spread of the outbreak from Nepalgunj SMC to other districts and provinces, the detection of measles cases in a highly mobile population with frequent cross-border travel, and low population immunity of the affected districts. Response measures in affected areas have been implemented, including active case search, case management and outbreak response immunization (ORI).",
        "Description of the Situation": "Between 24 November 2022 and 10 March 2023, a total of 690 measles cases, including one associated death (CFR 0.14%) have been reported from seven districts in western Nepal (Banke \u2013 327 cases; Surkhet\u2013 62 cases; Bardiya \u2013 49 cases; Kailali \u2013 39 cases; Kanchanpur \u2013 27 cases; Bajura \u2013 13 cases, and Dang \u2013 12 cases), and three districts in eastern Nepal (Mahottari \u2013 103 cases; Sunsari \u2013 34 cases; and Morang \u2013 24 cases) .\u00a0The outbreak started in western Nepal in Nepalgunj SMC, Banke district, Lumbini province, after a cluster of fever and rash cases was reported on 29 December 2022. Measles was confirmed by the National Public Health Laboratory (NPHL) on 2 January 2023. Following the confirmation and active case search in Nepalgunj SMC and adjoining municipalities, the first measles case was retrospectively identified from Nepalgunj SMC with a symptom onset of 24 November 2022.The NPHL has also detected laboratory-confirmed measles cases in eastern Nepal. The dates of the onset of the outbreaks in Mahottari, Morang, and Sunsari districts were reported as 24 December 2022, 23 December 2022, and 16 January 2023, respectively. These measles outbreaks are ongoing and adequate ORI must be undertaken to prevent spread of these outbreaks to adjoining districts .\u00a0The present outbreak is occurring in two clusters of districts in the southern part of Nepal bordering India (Figure 2). Due to the porous international border, and measles being endemic in both Nepal and India, the country\u2019s source of infection cannot be determined definitively without further molecular epidemiological studies.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Figure-1: Number of measles cases (n=690) reported in Nepal between 24 November 2022 to 10 March 2023As shown in Figure-1, the number of cases increased sharply in the last week of December but started declining in the second week of January and continues to show a declining trend.\u00a0Figure 2: Distribution of measles cases (n= 690) reported by district in Nepal between 24 November 2022 to 10 March 2023\u00a0Most of the cases (n=327; 47%) were reported from\u00a0 Banke district, Lumbini province, which borders India. Additionally, the routine immunization outreach session sites and microplan1\u00a0 were not developed with community involvement, leading to very few outreach session sites, a lack of awareness, and a large number of children who missed the vaccination.The majority of cases (n=591; 86%) have been less than 15 years old. However, nine measles cases have also been observed in the older age group (\u2265 45 years) with the maximum age of a case being 73 years.The current outbreak occurs in a population with suboptimal population immunity, which is partly due to the disruption in routine immunization services during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the quality of nationwide measles-rubella (MR) supplementary immunization activities conducted in 2020. Over half of the cases (58%;n=400) are unvaccinated, of these 68% (n=272) were less than four years of age. Only 31% and 28% of cases in age groups 1-4 years and 5-9 years, respectively, have received two or more doses of MR, showing susceptibility in these cohorts. According to the WHO/UNICEF estimates of national immunization coverage, in Nepal, the measles-containing vaccine first dose (MCV1) and second dose (MCV2) coverage were reported to be 90% and 87% respectively in 2021 nationally.\u00a0Figure 3: Age distribution and vaccination status of measles cases in Nepal from 24 November 2022 to 10 March 2023",
        "Epidemiology": "Measles is a highly contagious disease caused by the measles virus. Transmission is primarily person-to-person by airborne respiratory droplets that disperse within minutes when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Transmission can also occur through direct contact with infected secretions. Transmission from asymptomatic exposed immune persons has not been demonstrated. The virus remains active and contagious in the air or on infected surfaces for up to two hours.\u00a0 A patient is infectious four days before the start of the rash to four days after its appearance. The virus first infects the respiratory tract before spreading to other organs. There is no specific antiviral treatment for measles and most people recover within 2-3 weeks.Among young and malnourished children and immunocompromised people, including those with HIV, cancer or treated with immunosuppressives, as well as pregnant women, measles can cause serious complications, including blindness, encephalitis, severe diarrhea, ear infection, pneumonia, and death.An effective and safe vaccine is available for prevention and control. The measles-containing vaccine first dose (MCV1) is given at the age of nine months, while the second dose of the measles-containing second dose (MCV2) is given at the age of 15 months. A 95% population coverage of MCV1 and MCV2 is required to stop measles circulation.In areas with low vaccination coverage, epidemics typically occur every two to three years and usually last between two and three months, although their duration varies according to population size, crowding, and the population\u2019s immunity status.",
        "Public Health Response": "The Ministry of Health (MoH), with support from WHO, partners and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), have implemented response measures. These include: Ongoing active case search and line listing of fever and rash cases. Vitamin A is administered to those identified with fever and rash.\u00a0 The mobilization of health personnel including health care workers (HCW), local NGOs, and technical staff from WHO, UNICEF, the District Public Health Office, and the health unit of Nepalgunj SMC to implement response measures.The launch of non-selective ORI on 6 January 2023 by Nepalgunj SMC, targeting children aged six months to 15 years. As of 6 February, a total of 153 485 children have been vaccinated with one dose of the measles-rubella (MR) vaccine. ORI is being conducted in Nepalgunj SMC (with a target of 100% coverage) and adjoining municipalities (including Khajura, Narainapur, Duduwa, Janki, Raptisenari, Baijanath, and Kohalpur). Ongoing non-selective ORI with the MR vaccine in Banke and Kailali districts for children aged between six months and 15 years. The government plans to expand this ORI response to other affected/high-risk districts of western Nepal.Strengthening measles surveillance and mobilization of the district rapid response team (RRT) in Banke district. \u00a0Ensuring an adequate stock of vaccines and logistics, as well as medicines for supportive treatment, are available at the provincial and federal governments in case of urgent need.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "While measles is endemic in Nepal and is reported every year, the magnitude and extent of the current outbreak are unusually high compared to the previous years. Only sporadic isolated measles cases have occurred since 2004, when a substantial outbreak of 12 074 cases was reported. Based on the current data and available information, the overall risk of measles at the national level is assessed as high due to the following reasons: The outbreak initially reported in Nepalgunj SMC in Lumbini province has expanded, and cases are being reported in adjoining municipalities and provinces in western Nepal, and also eastern Nepal.The number of cases might be higher than reported, as cases in communities are not always counted due to suboptimal surveillance activities and underreporting of identified cases. The presence of a large number of migrants and mobile populations, making them vulnerable to measles infection:a significant number of the migrant population may not have information or access to routine immunization sites and are likely to miss routine immunization. The outbreak occurring in an area with a porous border between India and Nepal.Low vaccination coverage due to COVID-19 pandemic-related disruptions, which have led to an immunity gap in the population. The independent coverage survey post-measles rubella (MR) vaccination campaign in Nepal in 2020 (undertaken during the COVID-19 pandemic) shows 84% national coverage, indicating a high number of children vulnerable to measles infection.  Factors including the spread of the outbreak to neighboring districts and provinces, the detection of measles cases in a highly mobile population and minority communities, the low population immunity in affected districts, and cross-border movement, indicates the risk of intra- and inter-provincial as well as international spread of measles. The risk at regional level is assessed to be moderate (persistent endemic transmission on both sides of a porous international border), and low at the global level.",
        "WHO Advice": "Measles is preventable by vaccination, which provides lifelong immunity in most recipients. Vaccination against measles is recommended for all susceptible children and adults for whom the vaccine is not contraindicated. National immunization programs must assure the safe provision of immunization services that can reach all children with two doses of measles vaccine. In countries with moderate to weak health systems, regular measles immunization campaigns can protect children who do not have access to routine health services. WHO recommends maintaining sustained homogeneous coverage of at least 95% with the first and second doses of the MCV vaccine and strengthening integrated epidemiological surveillance of measles and rubella in order to achieve the timely detection of all suspected cases in public, private, and social security healthcare facilities.\u00a0 It is critical to quickly recognize and treat complications of measles in order to reduce severity of the disease and mortality . Severe complications from measles can be reduced through supportive care that ensures good nutrition, adequate fluid intake and treatment of dehydration with WHO-recommended oral rehydration solution. This solution replaces fluids and other essential elements that are lost through diarrhea or vomiting. Antibiotics should be prescribed to treat eye and ear infections, and pneumonia. While there is no specific antiviral treatment for measles, prompt provision of vitamin A in therapeutic doses is recommended to reduce complications and mortality among infected children. Healthcare workers should be vaccinated in order to avoid infections acquired in a healthcare setting. WHO does not recommend any travel and/or trade restrictions to Nepal based on the information available for this event.",

        "Outbreak name": "Avian Influenza A (H5N1)",
        "Date Reported": "26 February 2023",
        "Location": "Cambodia",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 23 February 2023, the Cambodia International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Point (NFP) reported one confirmed case of human infection with avian influenza A (H5N1) virus to WHO. A second case, a family contact of the first case, was reported on 24 February 2023. An outbreak investigation is ongoing including determining the exposure of these two reported cases to the virus.\nThese are the first two cases of avian influenza A (H5N1) reported from Cambodia since 2014. In December 2003, Cambodia reported an outbreak of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N1 for the first time affecting wild birds. Since then, and until 2014, human cases due to poultry-to-human transmission have been sporadically reported in Cambodia.\nH5N1 infection in humans can cause severe disease, has a high mortality rate, and is notifiable under IHR (2005).",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 23 February 2023, the IHR NFP of Cambodia notified WHO of a confirmed case of human infection with avian influenza A (H5N1) virus. The case was an 11-year-old girl from Prey Veng province, in the south of Cambodia. On 16 February 2023, the case developed symptoms and received treatment at a local hospital. On 21 February 2023, the case was admitted to the National Pediatric Hospital with severe pneumonia. A sample was collected the same day through the severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) sentinel system and tested positive for avian influenza A (H5N1) virus by the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at the National Institute of Public Health on the same day. The sample was also sent to Institute Pasteur Cambodia, the National Influenza Center, which confirmed the finding. The patient died on 22 February 2023. Cambodia shared the genetic sequence data of the virus from the index case through the publicly accessible database GISAID. Virus sequencing shows the H5N1 virus belongs to clade 2.3.2.1c, and similar to the 2.3.2.1c clade viruses circulating in poultry in southeast Asia since 2014.A total of twelve close contacts (eight asymptomatic close contacts and four symptomatic who met the suspected case definition) of the index case were identified and samples were collected and tested. Laboratory investigations confirmed the second case on 23 February 2023, the father of the index child. The father, who is asymptomatic, is in isolation at the referral hospital. The eleven other samples tested negative for A (H5N1) and SARS-CoV-2.As of 25 February 2023, a total of 58 cases of human infection with avian influenza A (H5N1) virus have been reported in Cambodia since 2003, including 38 deaths (CFR 66%); nine cases and seven deaths between 2003 to 2009 and 47 cases and 30 deaths between 2010 to 2014 were reported.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "A joint animal-human health investigation is underway in the province of the index case to identify the source and mode of transmission. Additionally, a high-level government response is underway to contain any further spread of the virus.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "These are the first human infections reported in Cambodia since 2014. Human infection can cause severe disease and has a high mortality rate. Almost all Influenza A (H5N1) infection cases in people have been associated with close contact with infected live or dead birds, or Influenza A (H5N1)-contaminated environments. Based on evidence so far, the virus does not infect humans easily and spreads from person-to-person appears to be unusual. An outbreak investigation is ongoing including identifying the source of exposure of the two reported cases to the virus. Since the virus continues to be detected in poultry populations, further human cases can be expected.Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk for sporadic infection or small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. From 2003 to 25 February 2023, a total of 873 human cases of infection with influenza A (H5N1) and 458 deaths have been reported globally from 21 countries. Public health measures from both the human and animal health agencies have been implemented including monitoring of contacts of the laboratory-confirmed cases. While further characterization of the virus from these human cases is pending, available epidemiological and virological evidence suggest that current A(H5) viruses have not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans, thus the likelihood of sustained human-to-human spread is low. Based on available information so far, WHO assesses the risk to the general population posed by this virus to be low.The risk assessment will be reviewed as needed as further epidemiological or virological information becomes available. Vaccines against avian influenza A (H5N1) for human use have been developed for pandemic use but are not widely available. WHO, through its Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) monitors the evolution of the virus, conducts risk assessment, and recommends the development of additional new candidate vaccine viruses for pandemic preparedness purposes. Close analysis of the epidemiological situation, further characterization of the most recent viruses (human and poultry) and serological investigations are critical to assess associated risk and to adjust risk management measures promptly.",
        "WHO Advice": "Given reports of sporadic influenza A (H5N1) cases in humans, the widespread circulation in birds and the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect and monitor virological, epidemiological, and clinical changes associated with emerging or circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health and timely virus sharing for risk assessment.When avian influenza viruses are circulating in an area, people involved in high-risk tasks such as sampling sick birds, culling, and disposing of infected birds, eggs, litter and cleaning of contaminated premises should be provided with and trained in the proper use of appropriate personal protective equipment. All persons involved in these tasks should be registered and monitored closely by local health authorities for seven days following the last day of contact with infected poultry or their environments.\u00a0In the case of a confirmed or suspected human infection caused by a novel influenza virus with pandemic potential, including a variant virus, a thorough epidemiologic investigation (even while awaiting the confirmatory laboratory results) of history of exposure to animals, of travel, and contact tracing should be conducted. The epidemiological investigation should include early identification of unusual respiratory events that could signal person-to-person transmission of the novel virus and clinical samples collected from the time and place that the case occurred should be tested and sent to a WHO Collaboration Centre for further characterization.Currently, there is no vaccine widely available to protect against avian influenza in humans. WHO recommends that all people involved in work with poultry or birds should have a seasonal influenza vaccination to reduce the potential risk of reassortment.\u00a0Travelers to countries with known outbreaks of animal influenza should avoid farms, contact with animals in live animal markets, entering areas where animals may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with animal faeces. General precautions include regular hand washing and good food safety and food hygiene practices. Should infected individuals from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during travel or after arrival. If this were to occur, further community-level spread is considered unlikely as on the basis of available information, this virus has not acquired the ability to transmit easily among humans.WHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions based on the current information available on this event. WHO does not advise special traveler screening at points of entry or restrictions with regard to the current situation of influenza viruses at the human-animal interface.All human infections caused by a novel influenza subtype are notifiable under the International Health Regulations (IHR) and State Parties to the IHR (2005) are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic. Evidence of illness is not required for this report.",

        "Outbreak name": "Marburg virus disease",
        "Date Reported": "25 February 2023",
        "Location": "Equatorial Guinea",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 7 February 2023, the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare of Equatorial Guinea reported the deaths of a number of individuals with suspected hemorrhagic fever.\nOn 12 February 2023, one sample was confirmed positive for Marburg virus by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), at the Institute Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal.\nInvestigations are ongoing to find additional cases. WHO is supporting the response by strengthening contact tracing, case management, infection prevention and control, laboratory, risk communication and community engagement.\nWHO assesses the risk posed by the outbreak as high at the national level, moderate at the regional level and low at the global level.",
        "Description of the Situation": "This is the first Marburg virus disease (MVD) outbreak reported in Equatorial Guinea.On 7 February 2023, the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare of Equatorial Guinea reported at least eight deaths that occurred between 7 January and 7 February 2023, in two villages located in the district of Nsock Nsomo, eastern province of Kie-Ntem, R\u00edo Muni Region. According to the ongoing epidemiological investigation, the cases presented with fever, followed by weakness, vomiting, and blood-stained diarrhoea; two cases also presented with skin lesions and otorrhagia (bleeding from the ear).On 9 February 2023, eight blood samples were collected from contacts and sent to the Centre Interdisciplinaire de Recherches M\u00e9dicales de Franceville (CIRMF) in Gabon, where they tested negative for both Ebola and Marburg viruses by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).An additional eight blood samples were collected from other contacts and sent to the Institute Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal, on 12 February 2023. One of these samples was taken from a suspected case that was confirmed positive for Marburg virus by RT-PCR. This case presented with fever, non-bloody vomiting, bloody diarrhoea, and convulsions and died on 10 February 2023 at Ebebiyin District Hospital. The case also had epidemiological links to four deceased cases from one of the villages in Nsoc-Nsomo district.As of 21 February 2023, the cumulative number of cases is nine, including one confirmed case, four probable cases and four suspected cases. All the cases have died, one in a health facility and the other eight in the community. There are no cases among healthcare workers. Thirty-four contacts are currently under follow-up.",
        "Epidemiology": "Marburg virus is the causative agent of Marburg virus disease (MVD), which has a case-fatality ratio of up to 88%. Marburg virus disease was initially detected in 1967 after simultaneous outbreaks in Marburg and Frankfurt in Germany, and in Belgrade, Serbia.Rousettus aegyptiacus\u00a0fruit bats are considered natural hosts for Marburg virus, from which the virus is then transmitted to people.Marburg spreads through human-to-human transmission via direct contact (through broken skin or mucous membranes) with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people, and with surfaces and materials (e.g. bedding, clothing) contaminated with these fluids. Healthcare workers have previously been infected while treating patients with suspected or confirmed MVD. Burial ceremonies that involve direct contact with the body of the deceased can also contribute to the transmission of Marburg.The incubation period varies from two to 21 days. Illness caused by Marburg virus begins abruptly, with high fever, severe headache and severe malaise. Severe watery diarrhoea, abdominal pain and cramping, nausea and vomiting can begin on the third day. Severe haemorrhagic manifestations appear between five and seven days from symptoms onset, and fatal cases usually have some form of bleeding, often from multiple areas. In fatal cases, death occurs most often between eight and nine days after symptom onset, usually preceded by severe blood loss and shock.In the early course of the disease, the clinical diagnosis of MVD is difficult to distinguish from many other tropical febrile illnesses due to the similarities in the clinical symptoms. Other viral haemorrhagic fevers need to be excluded, including Ebola virus disease, as well as malaria, typhoid fever, leptospirosis, rickettsial infections, and plague. Laboratory confirmation can be made by different tests, such as antibody-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), antigen-capture detection tests, serum neutralization test, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, electron microscopy, and virus isolation by cell culture.\u00a0Although no vaccines or antiviral treatments are approved to treat the virus, supportive care \u2013 rehydration with oral or intravenous fluids \u2013 and treatment of specific symptoms improve survival. A range of potential treatments are being evaluated, including blood products, immune therapies, and drug therapies.This is the first time that Equatorial Guinea has reported an outbreak of MVD. The most recently reported outbreak of MVD was in Ghana in 2022 (three confirmed cases). Other MVD outbreaks have been previously reported in Guinea (2021), Uganda (2017, 2014, 2012, 2007), Angola (2004-2005), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (1998 and 2000), Kenya (1990, 1987, 1980) and South Africa (1975).",
        "Public Health Response": "In-depth epidemiological investigations are underway to determine the source of the outbreak.National teams have been deployed to the affected districts for active case finding, contact tracing, isolating and providing medical care to cases.WHO has deployed experts in epidemiology, case management, infection prevention, laboratory and risk communication to support national response efforts and ensure community engagement.WHO is also facilitating the shipment of tents, materials for sample collection and analysis, and a viral haemorrhagic fever kit including personal protective equipment for 500 health workers.WHO is supporting the transportation of samples to laboratories in Senegal and Gabon as plans are underway to set up laboratory facilities in-country.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Equatorial Guinea is facing an outbreak of MVD for the first time and the country's capacity to manage the outbreak is insufficient.Based on available information, all nine deceased cases were in contact with a relative with the same symptoms or participated in a burial of a person with symptoms compatible with MVD. At this stage it cannot be ruled out that all MVD cases have been identified, therefore there could be transmission chains that have not been tracked. To date, most of the contacts of the nine deceased cases have not been identified. It should also be noted that with the exception of one case who died in a health facility, the other eight died in the community and their burial conditions are unknown.Cross-border population movements are frequent, and the borders are very porous, between Ebebiyin and Nsock Nsomo districts (Equatorial Guinea), Cameroon and Gabon. This constitutes a risk of cross-border spread.Considering the above described scenario, the risk is considered high at the national level, moderate at the regional level and low at the global level.",
        "WHO Advice": "Marburg virus disease outbreak control relies on using a range of interventions, namely case management, surveillance including contact tracing, a good laboratory service, infection prevention and control including safe and dignified burials, and social mobilization. Community engagement is key to successfully controlling MVD outbreaks. Raising awareness of risk factors for Marburg infection and protective measures that individuals can take is an effective way to reduce human transmission.Communities affected by Marburg should make efforts to ensure that the population is well informed, both about the nature of the disease itself and about necessary outbreak containment measures.Outbreak containment measures include prompt, safe and dignified burial of the deceased cases, identifying people who may have been in contact with someone infected with Marburg and monitoring their health for 21 days, isolating and providing care to confirmed patients and maintaining good hygiene and a clean environment.Healthcare workers caring for patients with or suspected of MVD should apply additional infection control measures in addition to standard precautions to avoid contact with patients\u2019 blood and body fluids and with surfaces and objects contaminated.WHO recommends that male survivors of MVD practice safer sex and hygiene for 12 months from onset of symptoms or until their semen twice tests negative for Marburg virus. Contact with body fluids should be avoided and washing with soap and water is recommended. WHO does not recommend isolation of male or female convalescent patients whose blood has tested negative for Marburg virus.WHO advises against any restrictions on travel and/or trade to Equatorial Guinea based on available information for the current outbreak.",

        "Date Reported": "24 February 2023",
        "Location": "Mozambique",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "In Mozambique, an outbreak of cholera has been growing exponentially since December 2022 with geographic spread to new districts. Heavy rainfall in the first weeks of February threatens to further worsen the situation.\nThe first case of cholera in the current outbreak was reported to the Ministry of Health and WHO from Lago district in Niassa province on 14 September 2022. As of 19 February 2023, a cumulative total of 5237 suspected cases and 37 deaths (Case Fatality Ratio (CFR) 0.7%) have been reported in 29 districts from six out of 11 provinces in the country. Of the at least 182 cases tested, 99 cases (54%) were laboratory confirmed for cholera by culture.\nAll six provinces currently affected by cholera are flood-prone areas. As the rainy season continues, it is anticipated that more districts will be affected. With this outbreak, cholera has affected many districts that had not reported any cases in over five years and where, as a result, the response capacity is limited.\nIn addition, there is inadequate access to sources of safe drinking water for the population that is already challenged with poor hygiene and sanitation.\nMozambique is one of many countries in the region facing a cholera outbreak at the moment. Notably, neighbouring Malawi is facing the deadliest cholera outbreak in its history. Considering the frequency of cross-border movement and the history of cross-border spread of cholera during this outbreak, WHO considers the risk of further disease spread as very high at the national and regional levels.",
        "Description of the Situation": "The first case of cholera in the current outbreak was reported to the Ministry of Health and WHO from Lago district in Niassa province on 14 September 2022.\u00a0\u00a0As of 19 February 2023, a cumulative total of 5237 suspected cases and 37 deaths (CFR 0.7%) have been reported in 29 districts from six of 11 provinces in the country. Of at least 182 cases tested, 99 cases (54%) were laboratory confirmed for cholera due to the identification of Vibrio cholerae Ogawa by culture. As of 19 February, eight districts (Chimbonila, Lago, Lichinga, Mandimba, Mecanhelas, Muembe, Ngauma and Sanga) of Niassa province (north of the country) reported 2525 cases and 16 deaths (CFR 0.6 %).\u00a0\u00a0In the central region of the country, nine districts (Beira, Buzi, Caia, Cheringoma, Chibabava, Gorongoza, Maringue, Marromeu, Muanza) of Sofala province reported 1354 cases and three deaths (CFR 0.2 %). Nine districts (Angonia, Cahora Bassa, Chiuta, Doa, Marara, Moatize, Mutarara, Tete, Tsangano) from Tete province, reported 1271 cases with 12 deaths (CFR 0.9%) since December 2022. Zambezia province (Milange district) bordering Malawi reported 14 cases.\u00a0In the southern region of the country, one district (Xai-Xai) in Gaza province, reported 42 cases and four deaths (CFR 9.5%).\u00a0\u00a0In addition, one district (Tambara) in Manica province, reported 34 cases and two deaths (CFR 5.9%).Additionally, four districts from three provinces (Tete \u2013 two, Zambezia \u2013 one, and Cabo-Delgado \u2013 one) have reported cases of Acute Watery Diarrhoea (AWD) that were positive for cholera by Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) with culture results pending. Notably, in the last 30 days the districts reporting cholera and AWD are increasing, with three new provinces reporting confirmed cholera.\u00a0Prior to the current outbreak, there were cholera outbreaks in eight districts in three provinces during the first half of 2022, which were declared over. The current outbreak of cholera in Mozambique covers a wider geographic area and has a higher CFR compared with the previous outbreak. Moreover, most of the affected districts, especially in Niassa province, had not reported cholera cases for more than five years and many of the health professionals do not have experience in responding to a cholera outbreak. Weak surveillance with late reporting, inadequate WASH conditions (lack of access to safe drinking water, poor sanitation and hygiene practices), a weak health system and exhausted workforce responding to multiple emergencies pose a threat to continued disease progression, as do the ongoing heavy rains of the season.Figure 1. Cholera cases reported by week and province in Mozambique from 14 September 2022 to 19 February 2023*\u00a0*\u00a0The 14 cases from Zambezia district are not indicated figure 1Figure 2. The cumulative number of cholera cases per 100 000 population in Mozambique by reporting districts as of 19 February 2023",
        "Epidemiology": "Cholera is an acute enteric infection caused by ingesting the bacteria\u00a0Vibrio cholerae\u00a0present in contaminated water or food. It is mainly linked to insufficient access to safe drinking water and inadequate sanitation. It is an extremely virulent disease that can cause severe acute watery diarrhoea resulting in high morbidity and mortality, and can spread rapidly, depending on the frequency of exposure, the exposed population and the setting. Cholera affects both children and adults and can be fatal if untreated.The incubation period is between 12 hours and five days after ingestion of contaminated food or water. Most people infected with\u00a0V. cholerae\u00a0do not develop any symptoms, although the bacteria are present in their faeces for 1-10 days after infection and are shed back into the environment, potentially infecting other people. The majority of people who develop symptoms have mild or moderate symptoms, while a minority develop acute watery diarrhoea and vomiting with severe dehydration. Cholera is an easily treatable disease. Most people can be treated successfully through prompt administration of Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS).The consequences of a humanitarian crisis or disasters like flooding\u2013 such as disruption of water and sanitation systems, or the displacement of populations towards inadequate and overcrowded camps \u2013 can increase the risk of cholera transmission, should the bacteria be present or introduced.A multisectoral approach including a combination of surveillance, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), social mobilization, treatment, and oral cholera vaccines is essential to control cholera outbreaks and to reduce deaths.",
        "Public Health Response": "Since the outbreak was declared in September 2022, a national cholera task force was activated and WHO, along with other partners, is supporting the response. Specific actions undertaken include:Coordination:The national cholera task force was activated with the involvement of the different working groups and cooperation partners, and weekly meetings are held. Health Cluster meetings on the cholera outbreak to discuss partner support are ongoing. Health and WASH clusters are maintaining a 4W (Who, What, Where and When) matrix to map partners interventions, gaps, needs and response for each affected district.Multisectoral coordination meetings are held weekly at district level and daily at provincial level. Cross-border coordination mechanisms are in place. Three cross-border meetings with Malawi have so far been conducted.Epidemiological surveillance and laboratory:Case detection continues at the community and health facility level. The National Rapid Response Teams (RRT) was established in each district continue to investigate the cases. Data collection is being done daily and a daily bulletin is being produced.Rapid test kits were allocated to priority districts. Testing of suspected cases is being carried out with support from the National Institute of Health.Case management:RRT are available and deployed in affected states. Training in case management was conducted for all 16 districts in Niassa province. WHO has provided six tents, cholera kits (central, periphery, community), Intravenous (IV) cannulas, cholera RDT kits and other consumables.Cholera treatment centers and cholera treatment units were set up in affected districts.Infection Prevention and Control (IPC)/Water, Hygiene and Sanitation (WASH):Additional surge staff deployment to strengthen surveillance, Infection Prevention and Control (IPC), case management and logistics is underway.Advocacy was conducted with the other partners supporting WASH functions. UNICEF and MSF have allocated water purifiers (CERTEZA), chlorine and bleach.Support visits on IPC and WASH in cholera treatment centres have been conducted. Risk communication and community engagement:Messages on cholera prevention and control have been translated into local languages and distributed door-to-door and in market places. Risk communication and community mobilization sessions are taking place in the communities.Vaccination:A request for approximately 700 000 doses of Oral Cholera Vaccine (OCV) was approved by the International Coordinating Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision and a vaccination campaign in affected districts in Gaza, Niassa, Sofala and Zambezia provinces is in preparation and will start on 27 February 2023.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Cholera is endemic in Mozambique and cholera outbreaks have been reported in the country every year during the hot and rainy season (October to April), mainly from Nampula, Cabo Delgado, Sofala and Tete provinces. However, the current outbreak has greater geographical extent than outbreaks reported in 2019-2022, when no more than three provinces were affected during the year.\u00a0\u00a0The first cholera case of the current outbreak was reported from Lago district on 14 September 2022, Niassa province, located in the northern region of the country, which shares a border with Malawi and Tanzania. All six provinces currently affected by cholera are located in the Zambezia Valley, which is a flood-prone area. As the rainy season continues, it is anticipated that more districts will be affected. The rainy season lasts until March-April, usually with a peak of rainfall recorded in January and early February. Heavy rainfall has already been reported in seven out of eleven provinces in the first weeks of February (31 January to 9 February), with flooding in Maputo province leading to displacement and disruption of the water supply system. There is inadequate access to safe drinking water sources for the population that is already challenged with poor hygiene and sanitation and the current rainy season could contribute to sustained disease transmission.\u00a0 Several affected provinces, such as Niassa, Tete and Zambezia, are bordering Malawi, which is currently facing its deadliest cholera outbreak in history. The borders with Malawi are porous with frequent movement across the border between the two countries. On 26 January 2023, Zambia notified WHO of a cholera outbreak in its Eastern Province bordering Malawi and Mozambique, where one of the two index cases had just returned from Mozambique. There remains a high risk of spread to other countries in the region, including Tanzania and Zimbabwe and further to South Africa. Considering the history of cross-border spread of cholera during this outbreak, the risk of further disease spread is therefore considered very high at the national and regional levels.",
        "WHO Advice": "A multi-pronged approach is essential to combat cholera and reduce mortality. The measures used combine surveillance, improvement of water supply, sanitation and hygiene, risk communication and community engagement, treatment of the disease and use of oral cholera vaccines. Countries affected by cholera are advised to strengthen disease surveillance and national preparedness to rapidly detect and respond to possible outbreaks.WHO recommends improving access to proper and timely case management of cholera cases, improving access to safe drinking water and sanitation infrastructure, as well as improving infection prevention and control in healthcare facilities.  Promotion of preventive hygiene practices and food safety in affected communities are the most effective means of controlling cholera. Targeted public health risk communication messages are a key element for a successful response.\u00a0 Promoting hand hygiene, use of toilets and food safety are effective means of preventing cholera. Serious symptoms and deaths can be prevented by ensuring communities understand the importance of ensuring people with cholera symptoms are well hydrated using oral rehydration solution and rapidly seeking care. Socio-behavioural data should be collected to understand community knowledge, risk perception, levels of trust, rumours and misinformation, behaviours, attitudes and practices; this data should be used to drive risk communication and community engagement activities and to inform those of other response pillars. Feedback systems should be established to enable those affected by the outbreak and response efforts to have two way communication with responders, with regular responses to their feedback to maintain trust.  Measures aimed at improving environmental conditions include applying long-term sustainable solutions for safe water supply, sanitation and hygiene in cholera-prone areas. Communities should be proactively engaged in the planning and implementation of these solutions. In addition to cholera, these interventions can also prevent a wide range of other water-borne diseases and contribute to achieving goals in education and the fight against poverty and malnutrition. Solutions for safe water supply, sanitation and hygiene related to cholera are in line with the Sustainable Development Goals. Rapid access to treatment is essential during a cholera outbreak. Oral rehydration solution should be available in communities and not just in larger health centers that can offer intravenous infusions and management at any time. Where these are not easily available, communities should be informed of how to make the solution at home and of the importance of keeping hydration high while seeking care for people with cholera. With rapid and appropriate care, the case fatality rate should remain below 1%. The OCV should be used in conjunction with improvements in water and sanitation to control cholera outbreaks and for prevention in targeted areas known to be at high risk for cholera. Risk communication and community engagement activities should be conducted to manage vaccine demand and raise awareness of vaccination campaigns. If a single dose schedule is being used, communication is needed to inform communities of why the dose schedule has changed and to share information on safety and efficacy.  WHO recommends Member States to strengthen and maintain surveillance for cholera, especially at the community level, for the early detection of suspected cases and to provide adequate treatment and prevent its spread.  As this outbreak is occurring in border areas where there is significant cross-border movement, WHO encourages the countries concerned to ensure cooperation and regular information sharing.\u00a0 WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel and trade to and from Mozambique.",

        "Outbreak name": "Nipah virus infection",
        "Date Reported": "17 February 2023",
        "Location": "Bangladesh",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "Nipah virus infection outbreaks are seasonal in Bangladesh, with cases usually occurring annually between December and May. Since the report of the first case in 2001, the number of yearly cases has ranged from zero to 67, though in the last five years, reported cases have been comparatively lower ranging from zero in 2016 to eight in 2019.\nHowever, since 4 January 2023 and as of 13 February 2023, 11 cases (10 confirmed and one probable) including eight deaths (Case Fatality Rate (CFR) 73%) have been reported across two divisions in Bangladesh.\nA multisectoral response has been implemented by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Bangladesh, including strengthened surveillance activities, case management, infection prevention and control, and implementation of risk communication campaigns.\nWHO assesses the risk as high at the national level, moderate at the regional level, and low at the global level.",
        "Description of the Situation": "Since 2001, Bangladesh has been reporting seasonal outbreaks of Nipah virus infection between December and May, corresponding with the harvesting season of date palm sap (DPS) occurring in the country from November to March. Reported cases ranged from zero (in 2002, 2006 and 2016) to 67 (in 2004). A lower number of reported cases was observed from 2016 following an extensive advocacy campaign against the consumption of raw date palm sap (Figure 1).However, between 4 January to 13 February 2023, a total of 11 (ten confirmed and one probable) cases of Nipah virus infection including eight deaths (CFR 73%) were reported from seven districts across two divisions in Bangladesh. This is the highest number of cases since 2015 when 15 cases including 11 deaths were reported.Ten of the 11 reported cases were laboratory confirmed, while samples could not be collected from one case before death and is therefore considered a probable case based on epidemiological linkage. Laboratory confirmation of Nipah virus infection was carried out through Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) using samples from throat swabs and antibody detection via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).\u00a0Confirmatory tests were done at the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) and International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh, (ICDDR, B) laboratories.Six cases were reported from Dhaka Division including four deaths from the districts of Narsingdi (one case who died), Rajbari (four cases including three deaths) and Shariatpur (one case). Rajshahi Division reported five cases including four deaths from the districts of Naogaon (two cases including one death), Natore (one case who died), Pabna (one case who died), and Rajshahi (one case who died) (Figure 2).Figure 1. Number of reported Nipah virus cases and deaths by year, 1 January 2001 \u2013 13 February 2023, Bangladesh. Figure 2. Distribution of Nipah Virus cases and surveillance sites (2001 \u2013 2023) [Left] and Nipah cases in 2023 [Right]. Of the eleven cases reported, four were females and seven were males. The median age of cases is 16 years old, ranging from 15 days to 50 years. Of the 11 cases, ten had a history of consuming date palm sap while one case, a 15-day old infant is considered a secondary case.Estimated incubation period of these cases ranged from 3 to 15 days with a median of 14 days. All of the 11 cases were hospitalized following the onset of symptoms.A total of 310 contacts have been identified around the 11 cases and are monitored for 3 weeks from the last date of possible exposure.",
        "Epidemiology": "Nipah virus infection is an emerging bat-borne zoonotic disease transmitted to humans through infected animals or contaminated food. It can also be transmitted directly from person to person through close contact with an infected person.\u00a0Fruit bats or flying foxes (Pteropus species) are the natural hosts for Nipah virus.The incubation period is believed to range from 4 to 14 days. However, an incubation period up to 45 days has been reported. Laboratory diagnosis of a patient with a clinical history of Nipah virus infection can be made during the acute and convalescent phases of the disease\u00a0by using a combination of tests. The main tests used are RT-PCR from bodily fluids and antibody detection via ELISA.Nipah virus infection in humans causes a range of clinical presentations, from asymptomatic infection (subclinical) to acute respiratory infection and fatal encephalitis. Infected people initially develop symptoms including fever, headaches, myalgia (muscle pain), vomiting, and sore throat. This can be followed by dizziness, drowsiness, altered consciousness, and neurological signs that indicate acute encephalitis. Some people can also experience atypical pneumonia and severe respiratory problems, including acute respiratory distress. Encephalitis and seizures occur in severe cases, progressing to coma within 24 to 48 hours.\u00a0Most people who survive acute encephalitis make a full recovery, but long-term neurologic conditions have been reported in survivors. Approximately 20% of patients are left with residual neurological consequences such as seizure disorder and personality changes. A small number of people who recover subsequently relapse or develop delayed onset encephalitis.The overall global case fatality rate is estimated at 40% to 75% depending on local capabilities for epidemiological surveillance and clinical management. Although antivirals are in development, there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutics available for the prevention or treatment of Nipah virus infection.",
        "Public Health Response": "The following public health response has been implemented by the government of Bangladesh.Coordination:The Communicable Disease Control unit and the Directorate General of Health Services (CDC-DGHS) held an emergency meeting on 28 January 2023 with all Divisional Directors, Civil Surgeons, Health and Family Planning Officers, and other public health experts to discuss and strategize the response to the outbreak.Surveillance:Outbreak investigation including contact tracing is ongoing by the National Rapid Response Team (NRRT) in collaboration with ICDDR, B.CDC-DGHS, IEDCR, the Health Education Bureau, ICDDR, B, and WHO, are focusing on strengthening the existing surveillance system; formulating strategy for immediate interventions; and information, education, and communication (IEC) content for advocacy and awareness.Case Management:CDC-DGHS and the Dhaka Medical College Hospital\u2019s senior clinicians are strengthening case management. COVID-19-designated Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds in the hospital were repurposed temporarily for Nipah virus infection case management.The infectious disease hospital (IDH) in Dhaka has been designated to support the quarantine and isolation of suspected Nipah virus infected cases.Infection Prevention and Control:Health care workers across all levels are instructed to observe optimal infection, prevention and control including wearing masks and gloves, investigating, and managing cases locally, and not referring cases to Dhaka for management except when necessary.The\u00a0National Guideline for Management, Prevention, and Control of Nipah Virus Infection\u00a0is being reviewed and updated, focusing on safety measures for healthcare workers and infection, prevention, and control (IPC).Risk Communication and Community Engagement:Advocacy, risk communication and community engagement activities (RCCE) are ongoing. Two hotline numbers have been activated for Nipah, one at IEDCR and the other at ICDDR, B, with the aim to collect formal and informal reporting of Nipah cases and also to meet the general queries of the public about Nipah and other infectious diseases.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "The overall risk is assessed by WHO as high at the national level due to the following reasons:Although Nipah virus cases are reported in Bangladesh almost every year, 11 cases and eight deaths, have already been reported in 2023, which is unusual compared to the past seven years.The case fatality rate from Nipah virus infection is high (73%). Initial signs and symptoms of Nipah virus infection are non-specific, and the diagnosis is often not suspected at the time of presentation.\u00a0This can hinder accurate diagnosis and creates challenges in outbreak detection, effective and timely infection control measures, and outbreak response activities.There are currently no specific drugs or vaccines available for Nipah virus infection although WHO has identified Nipah as a priority disease for the WHO Research and Development Blueprint.\u00a0 Intensive supportive care is recommended to treat severe respiratory and neurologic complications.Currently, the level of awareness among the general population is still low, despite ongoing efforts for risk communication and community engagement.There has already been one case of suspected human-to-human transmission during the current outbreak and secondary cases have previously been reported in Bangladesh.Fruit bats or flying foxes (Pteropus species.), the natural reservoir of Nipah virus, is present in Bangladesh and the genetic diversity of Nipah virus isolated from affected persons in Bangladesh suggest substantial diversity of the virus in the wildlife reservoir and repeated spill over of the virus from its reservoir to the human population.The risk at the regional level is moderate as Rajshahi district borders India. Although there have not been any instances of cross-border transmission by humans previously, this risk remains given the shared ecological corridor for the virus\u2019s natural host (fruit bats or flying foxes) and occurrence among domestic animals and humans previously in both countries. India also has experienced previous outbreaks of Nipah virus infection.The risk assessed at the global level is low considering the absence of natural hosts in many countries and the fact that there have been no previous cases outside Bangladesh, India, Malaysia, and Singapore.",
        "WHO Advice": "In the absence of a vaccine or licensed treatment available for Nipah virus infection, the only way to reduce or prevent infection in people is by raising awareness of the risk factors and educating about the measures persons can take to reduce exposure to the Nipah virus. Case management should focus on the delivery of supportive care measures to patients. Intensive supportive care is recommended to treat severe respiratory and neurologic complications.Public health educational messages should focus on:Reducing the risk of bat-to-human transmission: Efforts to prevent transmission should first focus on decreasing bat access to date palm sap and other fresh food products. Freshly collected date palm juice should be boiled, and fruits should be thoroughly washed and peeled before consumption. Fruits with signs of bat bites should be discarded. Areas where bats are known to roost should be avoided. The risk of international transmission via fruit or fruit products (such as raw date palm juice) contaminated with urine or saliva from infected fruit bats can be prevented by washing them thoroughly and peeling them before consumption.Reducing the risk of animal-to-human transmission: Natural infection in domestic animals has been described in farming pigs, horses, goats, sheep, but also in dogs and cats. Gloves and other protective clothing should be worn while handling sick animals or their tissues, and during slaughtering and culling procedures. As much as possible, people should avoid being in contact with infected pigs. In endemic areas, when establishing new pig farms, considerations should be given to the presence of fruit bats in the area and in general, pig feed and pig sheds should be protected against bats when feasible. Samples taken from animals with suspected Nipah virus infection should be handled by trained staff working in suitably equipped laboratories. Nipah virus infection can be prevented by avoiding exposure to bats and sick animals in endemic areas, and by avoiding consuming fruits partially eaten by infected bats or drinking raw date palm sap/toddy/juice. Reducing the risk of human-to-human transmission: Close unprotected physical contact with Nipah virus-infected people should be avoided. Regular hand washing should be carried out after caring for or visiting sick people. Health care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed infection, or handling their specimens, should implement standard infection control precautions at all times. As human-to-human transmission has been reported among caregivers including family members and in health-care settings, contact and droplet precautions should be used in addition to standard precautions. Airborne precautions may be required in certain circumstances.",

        "Description of the Situation": "Global overviewCurrent Situation\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Since the first disease outbreak news on the global cholera situation was published on 16 December 2022, the global situation has further deteriorated with additional countries reporting cases and outbreaks.Since mid-2021, the world is facing an acute upsurge of the 7th cholera pandemic characterized by the number, size and concurrence of multiple outbreaks, the spread to areas free of cholera for decades and alarming high mortality rates.In 2021, 23 countries reported cholera outbreaks, mainly in the WHO Regions of Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean. This trend continued into 2022 as 30 countries across five of the six WHO regions reported cholera cases or outbreaks. Among those, 14 had not reported cholera in 2021, including non-endemic countries (Lebanon and Syria)i,ii or countries that had not reported cases over three years\u00a0(Haiti and the Dominican Republic), while most of the remaining countries reported higher case numbers and case fatality ratios (CFR) than in previous years.As of 1 February 2023, at least 18 countries continue to report cholera cases (Table 1 A & B). As according to the seasonality patterns large parts of the world are in currently in low or interepidemic transmission period this number could increase in the months to come. The mortality associated to those outbreaks is of particular concern as many countries reported higher CFR than in previous years. The average cholera CFR reported globally in 2021 was 1.9% (2.9% in Africa), a significant increase above acceptable (<1%) and the highest recorded in over a decade. Preliminary data suggests similar trend for 2022 and 2023.\u00a0\u00a0 The potential drivers of the outbreaks and challenges impacting response activities were highlighted in the last Disease Outbreak News. The simultaneous progression of several cholera outbreaks, compounded in countries facing complex humanitarian crises with fragile health systems and aggravated by climate change, poses challenges to outbreak response and risks further spreading to other countries. The overall capacity to respond to the multiple and simultaneous outbreaks continues to be strained due to the global lack of resources, including the oral cholera vaccine, as well as overstretched public health and medical personnel, who are dealing with multiple disease outbreaks at the same time. Based on the current situation, including the increasing number of outbreaks and their geographic expansion, as well as a lack of vaccines and other resources, WHO assesses the risk at the global level as very high. Figure-1: Global situation of active epidemics of cholera and acute watery diarrhoea as of 1 February 2023Note: Countries in white are not reporting ongoing cholera outbreaks as of 1 February 2023.\u00a0Figure-2: Cholera cases* reported to WHO by year and continent, global CFR, 1989-2021*** In 2017 and 2019, Yemen accounted for 84% and 93% of all cholera cases respectively (Weekly Epidemiological Report 2018, 2020).**The data for 2022 is not included in the epidemic curve due to (i) incompleteness\u00a0 (ii) provisional estimates. Official reporting of case counts per country to WHO is expected at the end of the year and remains to be consolidated for the annual report.To note: data on cholera are often incomplete and underreporting is common. Several countries do not have reporting systems for cholera. This is why complete lists of countries with outbreaks, and accurate case and death counts cannot be provided.Regional overview In the table below, countries under monitoring are described. These include countries with active outbreaks of cholera and those which reported outbreaks in 2022. Other factors including the length of the outbreak, the size of vulnerable populations, and the overall contextual challenges are also taken into consideration.WHO Region of Africa: The ongoing conflict in the province of North Kivu in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) led to an increased influx of internally displaced people (IDPs) to camps close to Goma, during the last months of 2022. The lack of access to water and sanitation in the camps fueled the ongoing cholera outbreak. Additionally, the rainy season is worsening the cholera situation in other eastern provinces, increasing the risk of regional spread. Burundi recently declared a cholera outbreak in the city of Bujumbura, along the shores of Lake Tanganyika and near the border with the province of South Kivu in DRC. While the number of reported cases in some countries with widespread outbreaks in 2022, such as Cameroon and Nigeria, is currently declining, the situation in Malawi continues to deteriorate in early 2023 as it reports over 600 new cases per day. The country is experiencing its deadliest cholera outbreak in history with a continually high CFR (>3%) since March 2022. In addition, neighbouring Mozambique has registered a sharp increase in cases and alerts since mid-December 2022, with cases reported from five provinces, including provinces bordering Malawi. On 26 January 2023, Zambia notified WHO of a cholera outbreak in the Eastern province bordering Malawi and Mozambique. There remains a high risk of spread to other countries in the region, including Tanzania and Zimbabwe. Additionally, three countries in the Horn of Africa (Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia in the Eastern Mediterranean Region) are reporting ongoing cholera outbreaks. The continued drought is driving population movements which increase the risk of spread of cholera, and high levels of malnutrition, which increase the risk of severe outcomes of cholera in the region. There are multiple graded emergencies and stretched resource and human capacity due to other public health emergencies (COVID-19, mpox, malnutrition). Many affected areas are highly insecure and there is limited access to the population, which has limited access to healthcare. Climate change is leading to drought in some areas in Africa, and floods in others, resulting in increased population displacement and reduced access to clean water. High CFRs were reported from multiple outbreaks. There is high risk of regional spread in both Southern Africa with the rainy/cyclone season approaching and in the Lake Chad basin where there is limited response capacity due to insecurity.WHO Region of the Americas: The situation in Haiti\u2019s Ouest Department (which includes the metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince) is stabilizing. The department reported a third of the confirmed cases reported during the October-November 2022 peak. However, the outbreak is not yet under control and suspected and confirmed cases of cholera continue to be reported in all ten departments of the country. In addition, imported cases and limited local transmission are being reported from Santo Domingo, the capital of neighbouring Dominican Republic. The mobility of the local population \u2013 although restricted because of the severe insecurity in the country and lack of fuel \u2013 represents a continued risk of national and international spread. Additional exportations from Haiti to other countries and territories in the Region of the Americas are possible. According to the 2 December 2022 AMRO rapid risk assessment\u00a0the risk in Hispaniola is evaluated as Very High and the regional risk is assessed as Moderate. Efforts are ongoing to improve surveillance and laboratory capacity in the region. A cholera vaccination campaign is underway on Hispaniola Island.WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region: Weak surveillance systems (e.g. sentinel, hospital-based surveillance) in many countries of the region make the interpretation of data challenging. The region is characterized by stretched staff capacity due to complex humanitarian crises, and emigration of trained staff.\u00a0 The outbreaks in the region are spreading, with population movement exacerbated by conflict, climate change, droughts, and flooding. In 2022, the first cholera outbreak in over 10 years was reported in Lebanon and Syria, while Pakistan recorded its largest outbreak in decades.\u00a0 Cases in Afghanistan, Lebanon, Pakistan and Somalia are currently declining, and other countries in the region which reported outbreaks in 2022, such as Iraq and IR Iran, remain under monitoring.\u00a0 The widespread outbreak continues in parts of Syrian Arab Republic, and risk of further spread to other countries in the region and beyond persist.WHO European Region: Cholera is not endemic in the WHO European Region. Current robust public health systems, including access to adequate hygiene and sanitation standards at community and healthcare facilities coupled with surveillance and response capacities, lower the risk of further transmission following importation. However, countries bordering Syria and Lebanon, where large ongoing outbreaks are reported, may have a heightened risk of introduction and onward transmission in particular settings e.g., amongst refugee and displaced persons (T\u00fcrkiye). A heightened risk of cholera outbreaks in T\u00fcrkiye should be anticipated given the recent large earthquake that struck the southern and central parts of the country on 6 February 2023, and has had a devastating impact on infrastructure. In addition, in November 2022, Israel reported to WHO the detection of toxigenic Vibrio cholerae O1 in environmental samples from the Yarmuch stream upon its entry into Israel. Israel has taken substantive proactive measures to prevent cholera introduction and transmission and, as a result, the overall risk is considered low. The ongoing war in Ukraine stands to further worsen environmental and sanitary conditions and weaken health infrastructure in this area, however, cholera occurrence is of lower risk during winter months.In November of 2022, WHO European Region IHR invited Member States to report any imported or autochthonous case of cholera on an ad hoc basis to support global outbreak monitoring.\u00a0 As of 27 December 2022, 28 cases of cholera have been reported to WHO by eight European Region Member States, of which 24 were linked with travel to cholera-affected countries.WHO South-East Asia Region: The expected post-monsoon peak in 2022 was not apparent. Low-level transmission continues in Cox\u2019s Bazaar in Bangladesh in 2023, particularly among Forcibly Displaced Myanmar Nationals (FDMN). Both India and Nepal, which reported outbreaks in 2022, remain under monitoring. There is limited surveillance (often sentinel-based) and low reporting. There is continued risk of export to other regions.WHO Western Pacific Region: In the Philippines, recurrent cholera outbreaks were reported in 2022 with a cumulative number of recorded cases three times higher than in 2021.\u00a0 While countries of the region have overall good control capacity, there is inadequate monitoring of drinking water quality. Table 1A & B. Summary of reported ongoing cholera outbreaks as of January 2023",
        "Epidemiology": "Cholera is an acute diarrheal infection. When severe, it is characterized by extreme watery diarrhoea and potentially fatal dehydration. It is caused by the ingestion of food or water contaminated with the bacterium\u00a0Vibrio cholerae. It has a short incubation period, ranging between twelve hours and five days. Most people will develop no or mild to moderate symptoms; about 20% of ill persons develop acute watery diarrhoea with severe dehydration and are at risk of death. Despite being easily treatable with rehydration solution, cholera remains a global health threat due to its high morbidity and mortality in vulnerable populations without access to adequate health care.Seven distinct pandemics of cholera have been recorded over the past two centuries. The seventh pandemic, which is still going on now, is considered to have started in 1961.\u00a0 During the first two decades, following (re)introduction, many countries transitioned to becoming cholera-endemic. While global incidence greatly decreased in the late 1990s, cholera remains prevalent in parts of Africa and Asia.The global burden of cholera is largely unknown because the majority of cases are not reported, however, previous studies estimate 2.9 million cases, and 95\u00a0000 deaths occur annually.",
        "Public Health Response": "WHO is working with partners at global, regional & country level to support Member States in the following cholera outbreak response activities:CoordinationCholera headquarter Incident Management System Team (IMST) has been established.The multi-region cholera event was graded at the global level as a grade 3 emergency, the highest grade, on 26 January 2023.Providing a forum for technical expertise exchange through the Global Task Force on Cholera Control (GTFCC) coordination, and cooperation on cholera-related activities to strengthen the country\u2019s capacity to prevent and control cholera.Providing technical support to all ongoing outbreaks (laboratory, case management, OCV, IPC, WASH).Collaborating with key partners (UNICEF, MSF) to coordinate supply and optimal access to supplies.Leveraging resources to support global monitoring of the cholera pandemic, provide technical support to countries, enhance data collection and reporting, strengthen advocacy, and provide medical and non-medical items to countries in need, especially for case management and diagnosis.Supporting the deployment of experts through Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), and Standby Partners.Risk communication and community engagement partners activated through the Collective Service.Conducting advocacy and resource mobilization activities to support cholera prevention and control at national, regional, and global levels.SurveillanceStrengthening surveillance including strengthening diagnostic algorithms, use of rapid diagnostic tests, collecting and transporting of samples, and strengthening laboratory capacity to culture\u00a0V. cholerae.VaccinationProviding guidance to identify target populations for vaccination and requesting vaccine through the ICG mechanism, in the context of acutely limited supply.Supporting advocacy to increase OCV production and engage new vaccine manufacturers.Working with countries to identify the areas/hotspots where vaccination is most needed.3Case managementStrengthening access and improving care quality for patients by setting-up dedicated healthcare facilities (Cholera Treatment Centers (CTCs) and Cholera Treatment Units (CTUs)) which provide: 1) high quality triage; 2) focused and protocolized clinical management; 3) identification and management of complications. This requires a skilled workforce and clear clinical pathways, ensured through training for health workers and provision of technical guidance. Communities also need to be engaged to ensure rapid hydration support to people with suspected cholera and rapid care seeking behaviour.Embedding Oral Rehydration Points (ORPs) into the response to provide early intervention, which reduces the risk of severe disease and improves the referral processes when hospitalization is required.Harmonizing clinical data collection, reporting, and enabling quality improvement and audit through case report forms and common documentationInfection Prevention and Control (IPC)Supporting countries to assess and implement safety and quality of care focused interventions in health facilities to reduce risk of health care associated cholera infectionsRisk communication and community engagement (RCCE)Working closely with communities, Member States and partners to establish RCCE coordination mechanisms embedded within the broader outbreak response, mapping partners, identifying at risk communities and trusted channels/influencers, (especially WASH interventions, case management, vaccination campaigns and community based surveillance). \u00a0Providing support to maintain and build trust and manage risk perception and knowledge among communities about the disease, its symptoms, associated risks, precautions to take, and when to ensure adequate hydration and seek treatment when symptoms appear.Collecting, analysing and using social and behavioural data should be to inform the outbreak response to understand behavioural drivers of transmission, effective interventions and knowledge, attitudes and practices over time.

        "WHO Risk Assessment": "The risk of cholera is not equally distributed between regions, countries or within countries. The risk of cholera increases with decreasing access to clean water and sanitation.However, there are a number of outbreaks occurring simultaneously across all six WHO regions (the African Region, the Region of the Americas, the Eastern Mediterranean Region, the European Region,iii the South-East Asia Region,iv the Western Pacific Region), which are straining the overall epidemic response capacity. Protracted cholera outbreaks are exhausting public health response personnel and depleting global and local resources.  Several countries including Cameroon, Ethiopia, Haiti, Lebanon, Nigeria (north-east of the country), Pakistan, Somalia, Syria and the Democratic Republic of Congo (eastern part of the country) are in the midst of complex humanitarian crises with fragile health systems, inadequate access to clean water and sanitation and have insufficient capacity to respond to the outbreaks. Climate change and a lack of development are also contributing to outbreaks. In addition, many affected countries have highly mobile populations that may spread cholera to neighbouring countries (e.g. high risk of spread between Malawi and Mozambique, and to Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe; the surge in cases in DRC\u2019s North and South Kivu provinces increases the risk for spread to Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda; in Somalia, the uncontrolled cross-border movement of people, including refugees/asylum seekers with neighbouring countries especially Ethiopia, Kenya, Djibouti and Yemen; heavy population movement between Pakistan-Afghanistan, Iraq-Iran; the outbreak from Syria has spread to Lebanon with a continued risk of spread into Jordan). There is also a risk of spreading to currently unaffected areas by international travel to countries such as Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are at high risk for cholera outbreaks. After at least 10 reported imported cases from Haiti between October 2022 and January 2023, the neighbouring Dominican Republic continues to report cases linked to local transmission in 2023. There is the risk of further spread in the Americas. Cross-border population movements and increased global travel following the lefting of COVID-19-related restrictions, increase the risk of further international spread.  In October 2022, the ICG made the unprecedented decision to temporarily suspend the second dose of OCV for outbreak response, due to the global shortage of OCV, which continues in 2023. Although effective, the single-dose strategy will result in a shortened duration of vaccine-induced immunity, particularly in children under five years of age, leaving the populations vulnerable to cholera the following year. Based on the current situation, in particular: 1) the increasing number of outbreaks and geographical expansion; 2) the complex humanitarian context of many crises; 3) continuous risk of spread; 4) lack of vaccines and limited response capacity (supplies, human resources), the risk at the global level is assessed as very high and cholera remains a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequity and lack of social development.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO recommends improving access to proper and timely case management of cholera cases, improving access to safe drinking water and sanitation infrastructure, as well as improving infection prevention and control in healthcare facilities. These measures along with the promotion of rapid hydration and care seeking behaviour for potential cholera cases and preventive hygiene practices and food safety in affected communities are the most effective means of controlling cholera. Listening to and understanding community concerns, needs, challenges and capacities and positioning communities as partners in the planning and implementation of response efforts is key. This includes understanding and addressing barriers that impact the uptake of protective behaviors, the impact of stigma and discrimination and trust in health systems, actors and authorities. Recognizing community knowledge and capacities and systematically involving communities in strengthening WASH, community-based surveillance, case management and safe and dignified burial practices will build trust and help align health system response efforts with community needs. Equipping health workers to work with communities to ensure rapid care seeking behaviour and to hold safe and dignified burials will be essential to maintain trust between communities and the health system. \u00a0The OCV should be used in conjunction with improvements in water and sanitation to control cholera outbreaks and for prevention in targeted areas known to be at high risk for cholera. Given the limited supply of OCV globally, RCCE and vaccine demand efforts should be a critical part of vaccination campaigns to ensure maximum uptake. WHO recommends Member States to strengthen and maintain surveillance for cholera, especially at the community level, for the early detection of suspected cases and to provide adequate treatment and prevent its spread. Early and adequate treatment limits the CFR of patients to less than 1%. WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions on Member States based on the currently available information. However, as the outbreak also affects border areas where there is a significant cross-border movement, WHO encourages Member States to ensure cooperation and regular information sharing across all levels of the organization so that any spread across the border is quickly assessed and contained.",

        "Date Reported": "10 February 2023",
        "Location": "South Sudan",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "Since January 2022 to 1 February 2023, health authorities in South Sudan are responding to an ongoing outbreak of measles, with 4339 suspected cases including 388 (8.9%) laboratory-confirmed cases and 46 deaths (case fatality ratio: 1.06%) reported across the country. Two outbreaks of measles were declared by the health authorities in 2022 on 23 February and 10 December, respectively. Between March and November 2022, a total of 770,581 children were vaccinated during reactive vaccination campaigns. A nationwide vaccination campaign against measles is planned to begin in March 2023.\nThe current outbreak may have serious public health impacts due to the low national level of measles immunization coverage which is below the expected 95% coverage to interrupt the ongoing transmission. Other factors include the most affected age group being those under five years old, and the country context where there are armed conflicts, food insecurity and internally displaced people favoring transmission.",
        "Description of the Situation": "Health authorities in South Sudan have been responding to an outbreak of measles since the beginning of 2022. From 1 January 2022 to 1 February 2023, a total of 4339 suspected cases, of which 388 (8.9%) were laboratory-confirmed cases and 46 deaths (CFR: 1.06%; AR: 1.1/1000 population) have been reported from 55 counties in all of the 10 states and three administrative areas. Of the 4339 suspected cases, 3187 (73.5%) are unvaccinated. Among the unvaccinated, 2398 (75%) are under the age of five and 1021 (32%) are under the age of one. The highest cumulative number of deaths was recorded in Juba county in Central Equatoria state with 18 deaths (CFR 1.9%) and eight deaths (CFR 5.1%) reported in Cueibet county of Lakes state, while other counties reported less than five deaths in total. South Sudan started reporting measles cases in January 2022 in two counties -Torit in Eastern Equatoria State and Maban in Upper Nile State. Following a steady increase in the number of cases across the country, South Sudan\u2019s health authorities declared a measles outbreak on 10 December 2022. This was the country\u2019s second declaration of a measles outbreak after the first declaration on 23 February 2022. Figure 1: Distribution of suspected measles cases (n=4334) reported in South Sudan between 1 January 2022 and 1 February 2023 .Note: date of onset of disease was not known for five cases",
        "Epidemiology": "Measles is a highly contagious disease caused by the measles virus and occurs as a seasonal disease in endemic areas. In tropical zones, most cases of measles occur during the dry season, whereas in temperate zones, incidence peaks during late winter and early spring.Transmission is primarily person-to-person by airborne respiratory droplets that disperse within minutes when an infected person coughs or sneezes, and transmission can also occur through direct contact with infected secretions. Transmission from asymptomatic exposed immune persons has not been demonstrated. The virus remains active and contagious in the air or on infected surfaces for up to 2 hours. \u00a0A patient is infectious four days before the start of the rash to four days after the appearance of the rash. The virus first infects the respiratory tract before spreading to other organs.\u00a0 There is no specific antiviral treatment for measles and most people recover within 2-3 weeks.Among malnourished children and immunocompromised people, including people with HIV, cancer and treated with immunosuppressives, as well as pregnant women, measles can also cause serious complications, including blindness, encephalitis, severe diarrhea, ear infection, and pneumonia.Although measles is highly contagious, an effective and safe vaccine is available for prevention and control. The measles-containing vaccine first dose (MCV1) is given at the age of nine months, while the second dose of measles-containing second dose (MCV2) is given at the age of 15 months. A 95% population coverage of MCV1 and MCV2 is required to stop measles circulation.In countries with low administrative vaccination coverage, epidemics typically occur every two to three years and usually last between two and three months, although their duration varies according to population size, crowding, and the population\u2019s immunity status.",
        "Public Health Response": "With support from WHO and partners, the Ministry of Health of South Sudan, has implemented response measures including enhancing measles surveillance and strengthening case management by reinforcing capacities of frontline healthcare workers, surveillance officers, and the state and county rapid response teams (RRT). In addition, response interventions include:Strengthening coordination through activated Public Health Emergency Operation Centers (PHEOC), adoption of measles into the National Steering Committee (for COVID-19 response and Ebola Virus Disease preparedness) and other weekly coordination platforms.Enhancing surveillance including deployment of RRTs for investigation and sampling of suspected cases.Weekly analytics and monitoring of disease trends in affected locations.Between March and November 2022, reactive vaccination campaigns were conducted in 16 of the 23 counties with confirmed outbreaks where 770 581 children were vaccinated.A nationwide non-selective measles vaccination campaign, where children irrespective of their vaccination status are eligible for vaccination, is planned to begin in March 2023.Enhancing case management of symptomatic cases through supportive management and vitamin A supplementation.Strengthening community engagement and mobilization to increase awareness and demand for vaccine and encourage health-seeking behaviors.Using WHO measles programmatic risk assessment tool, a risk analysis, \u00a0was conducted in March 2022. The tool identifies areas where measles programmatic activities need to be strengthened to reach elimination and reduce outbreak risk countrywide.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "In South Sudan, outbreaks of measles remain a concern due to insufficient vaccination coverage, the non-introduction of the second dose of MCV (MCV2) and the absence of supplementary vaccination activities against measles in some areas over the past three years. South Sudan is one of the African countries with the lowest measles immunization coverage, resulting in suboptimal population immunity. The 2020 WHO-UNICEF estimates of National Immunization Coverage (WUENIC) for the first dose of measles containing vaccine (MCV1) were estimated to be 49%.\u00a0 Based on the measles risk analysis conducted in March 2022, 49 counties out of 80 (69%) in 10 states and three administrative areas are classified as \u201cvery high risk\u201d for measles transmission. All states and three administrative areas, except for the Western Equatoria, are classified as \u201cvery high risk\u201d. The assessment found that out of 80 counties, eight (10%) have a low risk of measles and 12(15%) are classified as \u2018medium\u2019 risk when assessing population immunity. The remaining 60 counties (75%) are classified as either \u201chigh risk\u201d or \u201cvery high risk\u201d for measles. This risk analysis looked at several factors including population immunity, surveillance quality, immunization programme, and threat assessment (factors that might influence the risk for measles virus exposure and transmission in the population). Although most counties recorded very high administrative coverage for immunization for measles during reactive campaigns conducted between March and November 2022, vaccination quality was not determined by a post-campaign evaluation (PCE).Low routine immunization coverage (69%), far below the WHO recommended sustained homogeneous coverage of at least 95%, is the main underlying cause of the multiple outbreaks in South Sudan. The low routine immunization is attributed to several factors including low access to basic healthcare estimated at 44%; insecurity that affects the functioning of health facilities; and inconsistent implementation of the basic package for nutrition and health services by public and partner-supported health facilities. South Sudan is also experiencing severe food insecurity with 57% of the population (6.54 million people) being affected. This has increased the risk of malnutrition in children, thereby increasing the risk of severe measles and adverse outcomes, especially those with vitamin A deficiency or whose immune systems have been weakened by HIV or other chronic diseases.Due to these multiple factors outlined above, the risk of spread of measles at the national level is assessed as high. At regional level, the risk is assessed to be moderate due to the cross-border movement of populations fleeing armed conflicts and insecurity in neighboring countries (Ethiopia, Sudan, Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Kenya) with suboptimal coverage of routine vaccination.The risk at the global level is considered as low given the existing response capacity in place.",
        "WHO Advice": "Vaccination against measles is recommended for all susceptible children and adults. Reaching all children with two doses of measles vaccine should be the standard for all national immunization programs. Countries aiming at measles elimination should achieve \u226595% coverage with both doses equitably to all children in every district.\u00a0 Routine vaccination of children against measles, combined with mass immunization campaigns in countries with high morbidity and mortality rates, are key public health strategies to reduce global measles deaths. Two doses of the vaccine are recommended to ensure immunity and prevent outbreaks, as about 15% of vaccinated children fail to develop immunity from the first dose. There is no specific treatment for measles. Case management of measles focuses on supportive care as well as the prevention and treatment of measles complications and secondary infections. Since measles is highly contagious, patient isolation is an important intervention to prevent further spread of the virus. Supportive care includes relieving common symptoms such as fever, cough, nasal congestion or rhinorrhea, conjunctivitis, and sore mouth. Nutritional support is recommended to reduce the risk of malnutrition due to diarrhea, vomiting and poor appetite associated with measles. Breastfeeding should be encouraged where appropriate. Oral rehydration salts should be used as needed to prevent dehydration. All children diagnosed with measles should receive two doses of vitamin A oral supplements, given 24 hours apart, irrespective of the timing of previous doses of vitamin A; 50 000 IU should be given to infants aged less than six months, 100 000 IU to infants aged 6\u201311 months, and 200 000 IU to children aged \u226512 months. This treatment restores low vitamin A levels in acute measles cases that occur even in well-nourished children and can help prevent eye damage and blindness. Vitamin A supplements have also been shown to reduce the number of measles deaths.In unimmunized or insufficiently immunized individuals, measles vaccine may be administered within 72 hours of exposure to measles virus to protect against disease. If disease does develop, symptoms are usually not severe, and the duration of illness is shortened.Healthcare workers should be vaccinated in order to avoid infections acquired in a healthcare setting. WHO does not recommend any travel and/or trade restrictions to South Sudan based on the information available for this event.",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "Cholera is endemic in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), including Ituri, North Kivu, South Kivu, and Tanganyika provinces, with cases reported through the year.\nOn 14 December 2022, a cholera epidemic was officially declared by the Governor of the province of North Kivu, following the isolation of Vibrio cholerae among 140 of the 247 samples collected from suspected cases of Nyiragongo HZ.\nAs of 4 February 2023, a total of 4386 cholera cases (of which 1009 are laboratory-confirmed) with 16 deaths (CFR 0.4%) have been reported.\nA multisectoral community-based response has been implemented, including a cholera vaccination campaign.\nConsidering the fragile context in which this outbreak is taking place, ongoing armed conflicts with further displacements, concurrent epidemics, inadequate levels of access to health care, poor drinking water, hygienic and sanitary conditions, and population movements between the affected HZs and neighbouring countries (including Rwanda and Uganda), WHO assesses the risk posed by this outbreak as high at the national and regional level, and low at the global level.",
        "Description of the Situation": "Cholera is endemic in several provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).However, from mid-November to the end of 2022, there has been an upsurge in the number of reported cholera cases in the health zones of Nyiragongo and Karisimbi, in the province of North Kivu. Since then, cases have shown a declining trend (Figure 1).Figure 1. Number of cholera cases (suspected and confirmed) reported in Nyiragongo and Karisimbi health zones. Source: line list of Nyiragongo and Karisimbi Health Zones.In Nyiragongo, the number of new cholera cases (suspected and confirmed) increased from 51 in week 47 (21-27 November) to 556 cases in week 50 (12-18 December) of the year 2022, and to 683 cases in week 52 (December 26, 2022-January 1, 2023).On 14 December 2022, a cholera epidemic was officially declared by the Governor of the province of North Kivu, following isolation of Vibrio cholerae in the stool of 140 cases from Nyiragongo HZ at the local laboratory in Goma.As of 4 February 2023, a total of 4386 cholera cases (1009 laboratory-confirmed; 23%) with 16 deaths (CFR 0.4%) have been reported, of which 4011 (91.5%) are from Nyiragongo and 375 (8.5%) from Karisimbi. In the HZ of Nyiragongo, the most affected age group is 5-14 years (30.1%), followed by 1-4 years (29.7%) and 15 -29 years (16.6%); children under the age of one represent 8% of cases.In total, 15 health areas including seven in the Nyiragongo HZ (Kanyaruchinya, Kibati, Kiziba, Mudja, Munigi, Ngangi III and Turunga) and eight in Karisimbi HZ (Baraka, Bujovu, Kasika, Katoyi, Majengo, Methodiste Mugunga and Muugano Solidarite) are currently affected by the cholera epidemic.In the HZ of Nyiragongo, the health area of Kanyaruchinya is the most affected, contributing to 73.3% of all suspected cholera cases reported from Nyiragongo. In Karisimbi HZ, the Methodist health area is the most affected with 59.4% of all cases, followed by Baraka and Lasika health areas (both contributing to 7.3% of cases from Karisimbi HZ).Figure 2. Cumulative number of cholera cases (suspected and confirmed) by health area in Niyragongo and Karisimbi health zones, as of 4 February 2023. Source: Nord Kivu Provincial Health Division. The cholera outbreak is principally affecting internally displaced populations (IDPs), with 97% of the cases reported among IDPs in the HZ of Nyiragongo, and 59% of cases among IDPs reported from the Methodist health area of Karisimbi HZ, which houses the Don Bosco IDP camp.However, the outbreak is also spreading across the surrounding communities with nearly 3% of the cases in the HZ of Nyiragongo and 41% of the cases in the HZ of Karisimbi belonging to the host community.",
        "Epidemiology": "Cholera is an acute enteric infection caused by ingesting the bacteria\u00a0Vibrio cholerae\u00a0present in contaminated water or food. It is mainly linked to insufficient access to safe drinking water and inadequate sanitation. It is an extremely virulent disease that can cause severe acute watery diarrhoea resulting in high morbidity and mortality, and can spread rapidly, depending on the frequency of exposure, the exposed population and the setting. Cholera affects both children and adults and can be fatal if untreated.The incubation period is between 12 hours and five days after ingestion of contaminated food or water. Most people infected with\u00a0V. cholerae\u00a0do not develop any symptoms, although the bacteria are present in their faeces for 1-10 days after infection and are shed back into the environment, potentially infecting other people. The majority of people who develop symptoms have mild or moderate symptoms, while a minority develop acute watery diarrhoea and vomiting with severe dehydration. Cholera is an easily treatable disease. Most people can be treated successfully through prompt administration of oral rehydration solution (ORS).The consequences of a humanitarian crisis \u2013 such as disruption of water and sanitation systems, or the displacement of populations towards inadequate and overcrowded camps \u2013 can increase the risk of cholera transmission, should the bacteria be present or introduced.A multisectoral approach including a combination of surveillance, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), social mobilization, treatment, and oral cholera vaccines is essential to control cholera outbreaks and to reduce deaths.",
        "Public Health Response": "Coordination: multisectoral coordination has been established at the provincial level, and daily coordination meetings are held in Kaniyaruchinya (Nyiragongo HZ). The incident management system (IMS) was activated at the WHO office. A budgeted preparedness and response plan has been developed and several partners are involved in the response, including WHO, which supports the Provincial Health Division (PHD) in the implementation of the health sector response in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and the other partners, such as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), International Organization for Migration (IOM), M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), UNICEF, World Food Programme (WFP), and Save the Children.Epidemiological surveillance and laboratory: a surveillance and laboratory commission has been set up by the North Kivu Provincial Health Division with the support of WHO and other partners. Four data managers have been trained and equipped with computers by WHO. Training on case definition has been provided to healthcare workers and community health workers (CHW); investigation teams have also been trained on active case finding. Surveillance activities are ongoing, including active case finding, alert notification and investigation, and contact tracing and follow-up. Data is collected daily from Oral Rehydration Points (ORP), Cholera Treatment Units (CTU) and Cholera Treatment Centers (CTC). Samples are regularly collected also from suspected cases registered outside the outbreak area in order to assess the extent of the epidemic. Data is analyzed on a daily basis and shared with partners for operational decision-making. WHO also supported the National Biological Research Institute in Goma with sample transportation. Case management: WHO and partners supported the establishment of 56 ORPs in IDP sites, four CTUs (Kibati, Kanyarucinya, Kahembe, and Don Bosco) and two CTCs (Munigi, Kiziba) in the most affected health areas, with a total capacity of 205 beds. WHO and partners also provided support for the free provision of basic health care in functional health structures in the two affected health zones to ensure the maintenance of essential health services for vulnerable populations.Infection Prevention and Control (IPC)/Water, Hygiene and Sanitation (WASH): an IPC/WASH commission has been set up by the North Kivu PHD and supported by partners including WHO and UNICEF. Systematic decontamination of households and public spaces is implemented by trained teams. Training for safe and dignified burials is also carried out. In IDP sites a total of 1706 latrines, 293 showers, 91 hand-washing stations and 62 well sites have been established. Regular supply of water is made through cisterns. Training for healthcare workers and hygiene workers on IPC practices is also carried out regularly.Risk communication and community engagement: Several advocacy meetings were held with community leaders and political-administrative authorities. Community workers have been trained to raise awareness about cholera, and preventive measures are communicated door-to-door and during public meetings with the affected population.Vaccination: At the national level, coordination meetings were organized to ensure the preparation of the vaccination campaign against cholera in the two affected health zones. WHO provided support to the Ministry of Health for the mobilization from the vaccination International Coordination Group (ICG) of 364 137 doses of oral cholera vaccines in the two affected HZs.\u00a0With the support of The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI), after its launch by the Governor of North Kivu province on January 25, 2023, the Oral Cholera Vaccination (OCV) campaign in three HZs of North Kivu PHD (including in IDP sites) took place between 25-30 January 2023 and immunized 351 207 people aged one year and older out of a target of 364 137, i.e. partial coverage of 96.4%.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Cholera is endemic in parts of DRC. In 2022, according to data from the National Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response System, a total of 18 403 suspected cases of cholera, including 302 deaths (CFR 1.6%), were notified in the DRC, in 104 HZs of 19 of the 26 provinces of the country. However, the current epidemic is showing a rapid upsurge in a fragile context such as IDPs camps.For years, DRC has been experiencing several armed and community conflicts, particularly in the east, putting the country in a state of unprecedented humanitarian and health crisis.Due to internal armed clashes, which intensified in 2022, nearly 450 857 new IDPs arrived in North Kivu (which already hosts 1.9 million of IDPs). Of them, 53.4% (240 579) are hosted in the territory of Nyiragongo and particularly 97.7% (235 111) in IDPs sites, which are characterized by overcrowding, poor hygiene and sanitation conditions, very limited access to drinking water, latrines and basic health services.\u00a0In addition, population movements are regularly observed between the affected HZs and the other HZs in the province of North Kivu as well as the rest of the country, where the populations also have limited access to drinking water, good hygiene and sanitation conditions, as well as to health care facilities.Moreover, the current rainy season may favor the spread of the epidemic in other HZs.With the ongoing armed conflicts, displacements are likely to continue, leading to a worsening of the humanitarian context and the vulnerabilities of the populations, including the need for basic social services. All this is evolving in a context of a fragile health system; recurrent attacks on hospital infrastructures and reduced availability of services. Other outbreaks are also ongoing (COVID-19, yellow fever, poliomyelitis, measles, mpox (monkeypox), meningitis, etc.) and there are extremely limited human, material and financial resources.The risk of cholera spreading to neighboring countries cannot be ruled out. Indeed, there are population movements between the affected health zones and neighboring countries, including Rwanda and Uganda.The affected HZs border the city of Goma, which has an international airport. Countries in the Great Lakes sub-region (Rwanda, Uganda, Burundi), which are most at risk of cholera importation from the current epidemic hotspots in North Kivu, have inadequate levels of access to health care, poor drinking water, hygienic and sanitary conditions. A cholera epidemic is also ongoing in Burundi with 120 suspected cases and 1 death reported as of 7 February 2023. This epidemic affects the city of Bujumbura, which is located on the shores of Lake Tanganyika on the border with South Kivu, with population movements across the border.The outbreak is occurring against a backdrop of a surge in cholera outbreaks globally, which has constrained the availability of vaccines, tests, and treatments.Considering the above-described scenario, WHO assesses the risk posed by this outbreak as high at the national and regional level, and low at the global level.",
        "WHO Advice": "A multi-pronged approach is essential to combat cholera and reduce mortality. The measures used combine surveillance, improvement of water supply, sanitation and hygiene, social mobilization, treatment of the disease and oral cholera vaccines. Countries affected by cholera are advised to strengthen disease surveillance and national preparedness to rapidly detect and respond to possible outbreaks.WHO recommends improving access to proper and timely case management of cholera cases, improving access to safe drinking water and sanitation infrastructure, as well as improving infection prevention and control in healthcare facilities. These measures along with the promotion of preventive hygiene practices and food safety in affected communities are the most effective means of controlling cholera. Effective risk communication and community engagement strategies are needed to encourage behavioral change and the adoption of appropriate preventive measures.Measures aimed at improving environmental conditions include applying long-term sustainable solutions for water supply, sanitation and hygiene in cholera-prone areas. In addition to cholera, these interventions can also prevent a wide range of other water-borne diseases and contribute to achieving goals in education and the fight against poverty and malnutrition. Solutions for water supply, sanitation and hygiene related to cholera are in line with the Sustainable Development Goals.Rapid access to treatment is essential during a cholera outbreak. Oral rehydration should be available in communities and not just in larger health centers that can offer intravenous infusions and management at any time. With rapid and appropriate care, the case fatality rate should remain below 1%.Community mobilization must continue as an integral part of the response and should cover information on the symptoms of cholera, on the precautions to take to protect against the disease, and the need to promptly seek care when symptoms appear.The OCV should be used in conjunction with improvements in water and sanitation to control cholera outbreaks and for prevention in targeted areas known to be at high risk for cholera.WHO recommends Member States to strengthen and maintain surveillance for cholera, especially at the community level, for the early detection of suspected cases and to provide adequate treatment and prevent its spread. Early and adequate treatment limits the CFR of patients to less than 1%.WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions to the Democratic Republic of Congo based on the currently available information.",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "Situation at a glanceMalawi is experiencing a widespread cholera outbreak, with 36 943 cases and 1210 associated deaths reported from all 29 districts since 3 March 2022. This is the deadliest outbreak of cholera in the country\u2019s history. Cholera has been endemic in Malawi since 1998 with seasonal outbreaks reported during the rainy season (November through May). However, the current outbreak has extended through the dry season, with cases being reported since March 2022.In light of the ongoing rainy season, wide geographical spread, and a consistently high case fatality rate (CFR) of above 3%, the ongoing cholera outbreak was declared a public health emergency by the Malawi government on 5 December 2022. \u00a0Currently, the large geographic spread and the high number of reported cases in the country are stretching all capacity to respond to the outbreak, increasing the risk of serious public health impact. The outbreak in Malawi is occurring against a backdrop of a surge in cholera outbreaks globally, which has constrained the availability of vaccines, tests, and treatments.With a sharp increase of cases seen over the last month, fears are that the outbreak will continue to worsen without strong interventions.Description of the casesOn 3 March 2022, the Ministry of Public Health of Malawi notified WHO of a cholera outbreak after laboratory confirmation of a cholera case in Machinga district hospital on 2 March 2022. Between 3 March 2022 through 3 February 2023, a total of 36 943 cases, including 1210 deaths, have been reported from all 29 districts in Malawi (overall case fatality rate (CFR) 3.3%) with active transmission ongoing in 27 of 29 districts. There was a 143% increase in the number of cases in January (17 078) compared to December (7017 cases). As of 3 February, Mangochi district bordering Lake Malawi is the most affected area, reporting 6974 cases and 114 deaths (CFR 1.6%).The current outbreak started in March 2022 from Machinga district following tropical storm Ana (January 2022) and Cyclone Gombe (March 2022) which caused floods leading to the displacement of a population with low pre-existing immunity and had lack of access to safe water, sanitation, and hygiene. The outbreak was mainly limited to the flood-affected areas in the southern region until August 2022 when it spread to the northern and central parts of the country. Since December 2022 cases have spread back towards the south of the country with all regions affected including Blantyre and Lilongwe, the two main cities of the country.Since the beginning of the outbreak, and as of 3 February 2023, the age group 21 to 30 years is the most affected (27.7% of cases) followed by the 11 to 20 age group (22.8%). Of all the cases,17\u00a0943 are males representing 57% of the caseload. Most deaths have been reported among those aged 60 years and above as of 29 January 2023. Most deaths have occurred among males (66%).From 1998 to date, cholera cases have been reported in the country, especially in the southern region, which is low-lying, flat, and prone to flooding during the rainy season. The highest numbers of cases and deaths were reported in 1998/99 (25 000 cases, 860 deaths, CFR 3.4%), 2001/02 (33 546 cases, 968 deaths, case fatality rate 2.3%), and 2008/09 (5751 cases, 125 deaths, CFR 2.2%).Figure 1: Number of suspected and confirmed cholera cases (n=36 943) and deaths (n=1210) per day in Malawi, 3 March 2022 to 3 February 2023.Source: Malawi Ministry of Health and PopulationFigure 2: Geographical distribution of confirmed and suspected cholera cases (n=36\u00a0943) and deaths (n=1210) by District in Malawi, 3 March 2022 to 3 February 2023.Source: Malawi Ministry of Health and PopulationFigure 3.

        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "Emergency response activities are being conducted by the Ministry of Health, WHO and other partners since the declaration of the outbreak in March 2022.Coordination and response: The ongoing cholera outbreak has been declared a public health emergency by government of Malawi on 05 December 2022. This led to the incorporation of cholera into its Presidential Taskforce on Coronavirus Disease, to be responsible for coordination of the outbreak response. The Presidential Task Force members on COVID-19 and cholera have been visiting all affected district to understand the situation. A costed national cholera response plan to manage the outbreak was drafted and is being updated regularly. WHO and other partners are supporting the implementation of various activities aligned with the plan. National- and district-level emergency operation centres (EOCs) have been operationalized to coordinate the multisectoral response with other partners.Multisectoral coordination group for cholera response has been established in the affected districts.The National Incident Management Team (IMT) continues to coordinate technical response to the outbreak. The IMT meets twice a week at the Public Health Emergency Operations Centre (PHEOC) in Lilongwe. The WHO IMT team is meeting three times a week for updates in between the National IMT to coordinate how to provide support efficiently across all response pillars.All technical thematic areas led by the Ministry of Health with support from WHO and partners continue to routinely provide technical support and coordinate field-level implementation.Cross-border preparedness is ongoing, with meetings held by health officials from MOH, WHO and Partners in Mozambique and Zambia through inter-district committees.Surveillance:National rapid response teams (RRT) have been deployed to all the affected districts. Health Surveillance Assistants have been trained on active case investigation and surveillance. Detection of cases at community and health facilities levels continue. Rapid response team established in each districts continue to investigate cases. Data collection and analysis is ongoing, and situation reports are being produced and published regularly. Deep-dive epidemiological analysis of the cholera situation is ongoing.Data collection tools have been harmonized, printed and distributed to all districts. More tools are being printed to meet the rising demand of reporting with the high volume of cases.The Ministry of Health with support from WHO and partners have strengthened community-based surveillance for early detection of cases through the utilization of community health volunteers. Lilongwe district which is one of the most affected districts has initiated integrated community interventions to interrupt transmission and reduce cholera-related deaths. The same interventions have been implemented in six high-burden districts and then rolled out across all the districts.Joint Ministry of Health and WHO field operational visits are ongoing in districts with high case load and deaths.The recruitment and deployment of surveillance officers and data analysts in high-burden districts to improve reporting and data quality is ongoing.Currently a team of local and international surge staff is in country to support strengthening of information management, surveillance and data management. The team continues to produce information products in form of daily and weekly situation reports, maps detailing case and mortality burden, location of cholera treatment centers (CTCs)/ cholera treatment units (CTUs), profiling of deaths by age group, location and treatment facilities they are occurring to guide targeted interventions.\u00a0\u00a0Health System Strengthening/Case Management:Case management was initially conducted through very large numbers (345) of cholera treatment units (CTUs) across all affected districts. As the extent and geography of cases has become clearer, this has been rationalised, with fewer centres. This presents an opportunity to strengthen the quality of care while respecting the decentralised approach. In some areas of high need, new structures have been set up or expanded (for example Bwaila and Area 25 in Lilongwe).Review and assessment of CTUs has been conducted across four regions in the last week (Salima, Blantyre, Lilongwe, Balaka), and more than 20 sites, with immediate needs identified and logistical input sought. This included the establishment of improved water and electricity supplies, improved waste management, and provision of beds and medical equipment for dealing with critical illness.Staff training has included, in collaboration with partners and Ministry of Health, 13 doctors, 46 trainer-of-trainers, and approximately 200 nursing staff ready to deploy to areas of need.Core standardised materials for patient care have been created and agreed with the MoH to enable the recording of treatment and response (including fluids and observation charts).To establish patient-level data to inform on care quality and to enhance our understanding of cholera presentations, a paper and electronic data capture form has been agreed with MoH, and begun to be deployed to CTCs.A network of supportive supervision from the tertiary hospitals has been created, with provision for outreach from specialist centres into patient treatment areas in order to enhance quality of care delivered, and support CTU staff.Partner and centre mapping continues, with the identification of formal and informal referral pathways. This includes those from high-burden areas, and specific demographics (e.g. under 2-year-olds), and has informed the strengthening of CTC staff numbers. WHO and partners supporting the establishment of oral rehydration points (ORPs) in high burden communities, inclusive of area 25, area 18, Likuni and Bwaila communities. Currently, 47 (ORPs) have been established in 10 high burden districts to serve as primary care points for cases in the communities. Church leaders, chieves, village headmen and community health workers and volunteers were orientated on the operation of ORPs and emphasis on their community engagement. The provision of ORPs needs to be scaled rapidly to provide early intervention and avoid admission with severe dehydration.Supportive supervision visits are being conducted on infection prevention and control and water, sanitation, and hygiene in CTCs in three districts. Main areas mentored on include patient segregations according to severity of disease during care in the CTC, handling of inserted devises, waste management, linen management, management of chlorine, use of personal protective equipment (PPE), management of guardians, and environmental cleaning. The teams also visited three communities in the three districts to assess WASH, including sanitary inspections of water sources, sanitation facilities, safe water accessibility, household water chlorination and conducted health education in communities.Capacity Building/IPC:Training of trainees has been conducted on cases management in Nkhotakota, Rumphi, Likoma, Chitipa, Nkhatabay, Mzimba North, Mzimba South and Karonga.Ongoing community field visits to assess WASH, including sanitary inspections of water sources, sanitation facilities, safe water accessibility, household water chlorination and conducted health education in communities.On-site IPC training and mentorship has been conducted amongst health care workers in CTCs/CTUs across all the districts in Northern Districts.Human Resource:Ministry of Health has advertised on recruitment of surge staff to support cholera response in the districts Blantyre, Karonga, Lilongwe, Mangochi, Nkhatabay, Nkothakota, Rumphi, and Salima.WHO is supporting the recruitment of 40 medical doctors (21 already reported for duty as of 03 February 2023), 80 clinical technicians and 160 nurses to support in the CTCs/CTUs across the country.Laboratory:WHO is supporting the Ministry of Health in increasing laboratory testing capacity and diagnostics to continue to monitor incidence in all affected areas with a focus on early detection and confirmation of new cases in unaffected areas, as well as genomic sequencing of Vibrio cholerae. The WHO is supporting capacity building, provision of reagents, and standard operating procedures. Collection of samples for sequencing is ongoing. Meanwhile, periodic testing of cases is being done with 5-10 samples being collected systematically every week from CTCs/CTUs.Logistics and Supplies:Cholera kits and other supplies including oral rehydration salt, IV Fluids, antibiotics, rapid diagnostic test kits, personal protective equipment, tents, and cholera beds have been provided by WHO and partners in affected districts.Treatment structures and ORS points have been established in the affected districts. Currently, 345 CTC and CTUs were established with 140 being active, and 47 ORPs set up in 10 districts serving over 180 000 population at high risk.WHO has provided cholera kits and other supplies which are being distributed to the affected districts, supporting 48 000 cholera cases since the beginning of the outbreak. Additional supplies are being mobilized.As of 03 February 2023, 35 cholera kits (drug module) composed of 17 600 litres of ringers are in shipment to arrive in country. 1271 ringers lactate (500 ml) and 5300 bags of ORS have been dispatched by WHO to District Hospitals with a high burden of disease including Lilongwe.Reactive Vaccination Campaigns: Two oral cholera vaccine (OCV) vaccination campaigns have been conducted across 21 districts since the onset of the outbreak.Following a request for OCV to the International Coordinating Group on Vaccine Provision (ICG) and approval in May 2022, a total of 1 947 696 doses were received as the first batch. Reactive vaccination campaign for one round of OCV was implemented in eight districts including Balaka, Blantyre, Chikwawa, Machinga, Mangochi, Mulanje, Nsanje and Phalombe between 23 through 27 May 2022. The cumulative vaccination coverage achieved was 69%.A second request for OCV was submitted to the ICG in October 2022, and 2 941 982 doses were approved for a single dose campaign. The campaign was implemented from 28 November through 2 December 2022 in 13 districts: Chitipa, Kasungu, Nsanje, Rhumphi, Salima, Karonga, Zomba, Mzimba North and South, Nkhatabay, Nkhotakota, Lilongwe, Likoma. The cumulative coverage achieved was 83.6%.Ongoing provision of OCV continued beyond the campaign period with additional campaigns in Mangochi and Blantyre (beyond the 13 targeted district). In total, 96.8% (2 825 229 doses) of the population residing in communities with high risk and burden of cholera were reached with OCV.\u00a0Risk Communication and Community Engagement:Community and national radios are being used for spreading awareness in the affected communities and spreading message for cholera prevention. Four community radios (Nkhotakota, Nkhatabay, Mzimba and Rumphi) produced jingles, airing radio programs and live panel discussion with support from UNICEF.WHO has supported the creation of Information, education and communication materials (WASH cholera brochure, cholera poster, leaflet for health workers, posters on waste management, OCV campaign posters).Local leaders and health-based leaders have been engaged by health promotion officers with support from Red Cross.Districts authorities have been communicated to write letters to churches, chiefs and local community structures to strengthen cholera prevention measures in the community and during gatherings.Knowledge, Attitude and Perception survey has been conducted in Blantyre, Salima Nkhatabay to understand the drivers of the cholera outbreak and guide targeted interventions in the affected communities.WASH Interventions:Provision of mobile latrines in the cholera treatment camps and installation of prefabricated latrines in five camps.Households in the affected districts are being sensitized on WASH promotion including water treatment and hand hygiene.House-to-house chlorination is ongoing in affected communities in all the districts. Water quality monitoring tests have been donated by UNICEF and have been distributed across the districts to strengthen water quality surveillance.Water quality surveillance have been conducted in Balaka, Blantyre, Chikwawa, Karonga, Machinga, Mangochi, Mwanza, Neno, Nsanje, Mwanza, Salima, Nkhotakota, and\u00a0 Nkhatabay. Supply of High-Test Hypochlorite by The Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) to Nkhotakota, Nkhatabay, Rumphi, Karonga and Mzimba A total of 9579 chlorine dispensers have been installed in four districts including Zomba, Blantyre, Balaka and Mangochi.Continued distribution of 1% stock solution is being done to community members in all districts by Health Surveillance Assistants.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Cholera is endemic in Malawi with seasonal outbreaks occurring during the wet season. The first major outbreak occurred in 1998 and was widespread in the Southern Region, with 25 000 cases reported. Prior to the current outbreak, the largest outbreak in Malawi occured from October 2001 to April 2002, and affected 26 of the 29 districts, with 33 546 cases and 968 deaths (CFR 3%).\u00a0 Following floods in the southern region in January 2022, the Ministry of Health confirmed a cholera outbreak on 3 March 2022. This outbreak, which was initially limited to the Southern Region and the flood-affected areas, has now spread to all the regions and districts in the country. Transmission has continued during the dry season (June to October), which is traditionally a low transmission period for Malawi. With the onset of the rainy season from November through May, the number and spread of cholera cases is expected to increase further. Therefore, the risk is considered to be very high at the national level. The poor WASH capacities in the affected districts, especially in the fishing communities along Lake Malawi, pose risk for the continuous propagation of the cholera outbreak nationally, to neighbouring countries and in the region.Two reactive single-dose OCV campaigns have been carried out in parts of 21 affected districts, however unvaccinated sub-districts and districts still remain at risk. Other identified challenges from the most at-risk districts include inadequate capacity for case management and diagnosis in the affected areas resulting in delayed case detection and poor outcomes. This is further exacerbated due to delayed care-seeking behaviour of the community.There is a continued risk for further increase in the number of cases and international spread. Confirmed cases have been reported across the border in Mozambique and the risk for cross-border transmission between Malawi and Mozambique remains high during the current outbreak.The country has experience in controlling cholera outbreaks. However, due to concurrent outbreaks (polio, COVID-19), the large geographic spread of the outbreak (with cases reported in all districts) and the high case numbers, the current burden is overstraining existing national response capacity and resources as well as the capacity of partners\u2019 support. In addition, there are multiple ongoing large cholera outbreaks worldwide. This is stretching limited global stocks of cholera supplies and OCV, which limits available resources for Malawi and the region. WHO assesses the risk of this outbreak to be very high at national and regional level. On 21 January 2023, WHO assessed the risk of the global cholera outbreak as very high due to ongoing multiple cholera outbreaks in many WHO regions.",
        "WHO Advice": "There is an urgent need to improve access to safe water sanitation and hygiene. WHO recommends improving access to safe drinking water and sanitation infrastructure, improving access to proper and timely case management of cholera cases as well as improving infection, prevention, and control in healthcare facilities. Promotion of preventive hygiene practices and food safety in affected communities are the most effective means of controlling cholera. Targeted public health communication messages are a key element for a successful response. OCV should be used in conjunction with improvements in water and sanitation to control cholera outbreaks and for prevention in targeted areas known to be at high risk for cholera.One of the factors contributing to the high CFR in Mangochi, Blantyre, Machinga, Lilongwe was late presentation to a health facility. Delay in health-seeking behaviour, and limited community sensitization can lead to treatment delays and increased deaths, as well as an underestimation of the scale of the outbreak (cases and related deaths). WHO recommends Member States to strengthen and maintain surveillance for cholera, especially at the community level, for the early detection of suspected cases and to provide adequate treatment and prevent its spread. Early and adequate treatment limits the CFR of hospitalized patients to less than 1%. Inter-district and cross-border coordination and collaboration, risk communication, and community engagement are crucial in the prevention and containment of this cholera outbreak.\u00a0\u00a0WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions on Malawi based on the currently available information. However, as the outbreak is taking place in border areas where there is a significant cross-border movement, WHO encourages Malawi and its neighbouring countries to ensure cooperation and regular information sharing so that any spread across the border is quickly contained.",

        "Location": "Oman",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 5 January 2023, Oman IHR-NFP notified WHO of a case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), in a 60-year-old male, from North Batinah Governorate in Oman. The case had no history of physical contact with dromedaries, goats, sheep or contact with camel products, milk, or urine. Based on the investigation conducted to identify potential exposure sources within the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms, camel racing exercises were found to have been conducted in the area of the patient\u2019s residence in North Batinah Governorate. A total of 76 close contacts were followed for 14 days from the date of last exposure with the case. No secondary cases have been reported to date.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 5 January 2023, the National IHR Focal point of Oman notified WHO of one case of MERS-CoV from North Batinah Governorate in Oman. The case, a 60-year-old male, non-healthcare worker, with comorbidities, who is a resident of North Batinah Governorate, developed symptoms including chest discomfort, shortness of breath, and fever on 28 December which lasted for six days. On 2 January, he was taken to the emergency department of a secondary hospital where he was admitted to the Cardiology Unit for non-invasive ventilation. Prior to admission at the hospital, the case sought medical attention in two healthcare facilities for his symptoms. The case subsequently showed clinical and radiological improvement and was discharged on 16 January 2023.Screening for Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) was initiated on 3 January 2023 and MERS-CoV was confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. Investigation of the history of exposure to the known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of the symptoms identified camel racing exercises conducted in the same area as the patient\u2019s residence in North Batinah Governorate. The case, a driving instructor by occupation, had no history of physical contact with dromedaries, goats, sheep or contact with camel products, milk, or urine. The last MERS-CoV infection was reported from Oman in May 2022. The first ever laboratory-confirmed case of MERS-CoV in Oman was reported in June 2013. Since then, including this current case, Oman has reported 26 cases of MERS-CoV including seven deaths (CFR 27%).",
        "Epidemiology": "Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory infection that is caused by a coronavirus called Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedary camels who are the natural host and zoonotic source of the MERS-CoV infection.MERS-CoV infections range from asymptomatic or mild respiratory symptoms to severe acute respiratory disease and death. A typical presentation of MERS-CoV disease is fever, cough and shortness of breath. Pneumonia is a common finding, but not always present. Gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhoea, have also been reported. The virus appears to cause more severe disease in older people, persons with weakened immune systems and those with chronic diseases such as renal disease, cancer, chronic lung disease, and diabetes. Severe illness can cause respiratory failure that requires mechanical ventilation and support in an intensive care unit and can result in high mortality.No vaccine or specific treatment is currently available, although several MERS-CoV-specific vaccines and treatments are in development. Treatment is supportive and based on the patient\u2019s clinical condition.",
        "Public Health Response": "Exposure history of the case was collected to identify the source of exposure.The contacts list included 24 contacts from family members and workplace, and 51 health care workers (12 from two Health Care facilities and 39 from the hospital where he was admitted), and one patient.\u00a0 The health care workers in the hospital followed the Ministry of Health (MOH) Infection Prevention and Control guidelines for using Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).All identified contacts were traced, monitored and followed up for symptoms for 14 days from the last date of exposure to the MERS-CoV patient, especially high-risk contacts among healthcare workers.Out of 76 contacts, seven contacts developed mild respiratory symptoms (five healthcare workers and two family members), as per the MOH Infection Prevention and Control guideline for MERS-COV exposures and cases. These seven cases have been tested for MERS-CoV by RT-PCR and the results were negative.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory infection of humans and dromedary camels which is caused by a coronavirus called Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease resulting in high mortality. Since 2012, globally the case fatality rate (CFR) for MERS-CoV cases is approximately 36%, but this may be an overestimate of the true mortality rate, as mild cases of MERS may be missed by existing surveillance systems and until more is known about the disease, the case fatality rates are counted only amongst the laboratory-confirmed cases reported to WHO. Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedaries who are a host and zoonotic source of MERS-CoV infection. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to be transmitted between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts and in healthcare settings. Outside of the healthcare setting there has been limited human-to human transmission.Cases of MERS-CoV infection are rare in Oman.\u00a0 Since June 2013, a total of 26 MERS-CoV cases and seven deaths, including this current case, have been reported to WHO from Oman. The total number of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection cases reported globally to WHO is 2603 including 935 associated deaths (CFR 36%) as of December 2022. The majority of the reported cases have occurred in countries in the Arabian Peninsula. Outside of this region, there has been one large outbreak in the Republic of Korea, in May 2015, during which 186 laboratory-confirmed cases (185 in Republic of Korea and one in China) and 38 deaths (CFR 21%) were reported. The global number reflects the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths reported to WHO under IHR (2005) to date. The notification of this case does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East and/or other countries where MERS-CoV is circulating in dromedaries, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who were exposed to the virus through contact with dromedaries or their products (for example, consumption of raw camel milk), or in a healthcare setting. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessments based on the latest available information.",
        "WHO Advice": "Surveillance: Based on the current situation and available information, WHO re-emphasizes the importance of strong surveillance by all Member States for acute respiratory infections, including MERS-CoV, and to carefully review any unusual patterns.Infection prevention and control in healthcare settings: Human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV in healthcare settings has been associated with delays in recognizing the early symptoms of MERS-CoV infection, slow triage of suspected cases and delays in implementing Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) measures. IPC measures are therefore critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV between people, particularly in healthcare facilities. Healthcare workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, at every interaction in healthcare settings:Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection.Contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection.Airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol-generating procedures or in settings where aerosol-generating procedures are conducted.IPC strategies to prevent or limit transmission in healthcare settings include the following: ensuring triage, early recognition, and source control (isolating patients with suspected MERS-CoV); applying standard precautions for all patients; implementing empiric additional precautions (droplet and contact and, whenever applicable, airborne precautions) for suspected cases of MERS-CoV; implementing administrative controls; using environmental and engineering controls.Infection prevention and control in the community: General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to. Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid consuming raw camel products like milk or urine or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.MERS-CoV appears to cause more severe disease in people with underlying chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons. Therefore, people with these underlying medical conditions should avoid close contact with animals, particularly dromedary camels, when visiting farms, events (e.g., camel races, or camel beauty pageants), markets, or barn areas where dromedaries are present. Case management: Early identification, case management and isolation of cases, quarantine of contacts, together with appropriate infection prevention and control measures in health care settings and public health awareness can prevent human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV.Timely, effective, and safe supportive management of patients with MERS should be provided, particularly for those at risk of more severe disease. International travel and trade: WHO does not advise specific MERS-CoV screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.",

However, the ongoing outbreak shows both an increased number of cases and an increased growth rate compared to the previous seasons.\nZinder region shares an international border with Jigawa State in Nigeria where a NmC outbreak is also ongoing, confirming the risk of international spread. Moreover, the simultaneous occurrence of other epidemics, insecurity and population displacement, all in the context of a protracted humanitarian crisis, are likely to contribute to the spread of the outbreak in other countries of the West African subregion.\nWHO assesses the risk posed by the current meningitis outbreak in Niger as high at the national level, moderate at the regional level, and low at the global level.",
        "Description of the Situation": "Being located in the African meningitis belt, Niger has been affected by several meningitis epidemics resulting in 20 789 cases and 1369 deaths (CFR 6.6%) reported since 2015. From 1 November 2022 to 27 January 2023, a total of 559 cases of meningitis (of which 111 are laboratory confirmed), including 18 deaths (overall CFR 3.2%) have been reported from Zinder region, southeast of Niger, compared to the 231 cases reported during 1 November 2021 to 31 January 2022.The last meningitis outbreak in the Zinder region, occurred in the 2021/2022 season, with a total of 372 cases, including 12 deaths (CFR 3%).Figure 1. Epicurve of cases of meningitis reported in Niger by month, 1 October 2021 - 27 January 2023. Of the 228 samples collected from suspected cases, 154 (67.5%) have been analyzed by Niamey's Center for Medical and Health Research (CERMES). Neisseria meningitidis serogroup C was identified in the majority of confirmed cases (n=104; 93.7%), followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=5; 4.5%) and Haemophilus influenzae (n=2; 1.8%). The remaining 43 samples tested negative.Males represent 53% of all cases. Among the total of 559 cases of meningitis, people under 20 years of age are the most affected by the outbreak (n=538; 96.3%), with 202 cases (36.2%) reported in the 10-14 years age group, followed by the 5-9 years age group with 153 cases (27.4%), the 15-19 years age group with 107 cases (19.1%), and the 0-4 years age group with 76 cases (13.6%).The most affected health district of Zinder region is Dungass (342 cases, 6 deaths), followed by Matam\u00e8ye (98 cases, 3 deaths), Mirriah (72 cases, 3 deaths), Magaria (38 cases, 5 deaths), Zinder ville (7 cases, 1 death) and Gour\u00e9 (2 cases, 0 deaths).Figure 2. Distribution of reported meningitis cases by health district, Zinder region, Niger, 1 November 2022 \u2013 27 January 2023.",
        "Epidemiology": "Meningitis is a serious infection of the meninges, the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. Several different bacteria can cause meningitis, however,\u00a0Streptococcus pneumoniae,\u00a0Haemophilus influenzae,\u00a0Neisseria meningitidis (N. meningitis)\u00a0are the most frequent ones, and are transmitted from person to person through droplets of respiratory or throat secretions from infected people.A total of 12 serogroups of\u00a0N. meningitidis\u00a0have been identified, six of which (A, B, C, W, X and Y) can cause meningococcal meningitis epidemics.The average incubation period is 4 days but can range between 2 and 10 days. The most common symptoms of meningitis are a stiff neck, high fever, sensitivity to light, confusion, headaches and vomiting. Even with early diagnosis and adequate treatment, 5% to 10% of patients die, typically within 24 to 48 hours after the onset of symptoms. Bacterial meningitis may result in brain damage, hearing loss or a learning disability in 10% to 20% of survivors. A less common, but even more severe (and often fatal), form of meningococcal disease is meningococcal septicaemia, which is characterized by a haemorrhagic rash and rapid circulatory collapse.The highest burden of disease is seen in a region of sub-Saharan Africa, known as the African Meningitis Belt, which is especially recognised to be at high risk of meningococcal but also pneumococcal meningitis epidemics.Niger is located largely in the African meningitis belt, where meningitis epidemics typically follow a seasonal pattern (usually from January to June), with a size that varies from year to year. In 2015, a large meningitis outbreak attributed to NmC occurred, affecting nearly 10 000 people. In 2009 and 2006, meningitis outbreaks caused by\u00a0N. meningitidis\u00a0serogroups A (NmA) and X (NmX), respectively, were also reported.\u00a0Haemophilus influenzae\u00a0and\u00a0Streptococcus pneumoniae\u00a0are two other important pathogens that contribute significantly to the bacterial meningitis burden within Niger.Licensed vaccines against meningococcal, pneumococcal and haemophilus influenzae diseases have been available for many years. These bacteria have several different strains (known as serotypes or serogroups) and vaccines are designed to protect against the most harmful strains. Over time, there have been major improvements in strain coverage and vaccine availability, but no universal vaccine against these infections exists.In the African meningitis belt, meningococcus serogroup A accounted for 80\u201385% of meningitis epidemics before the introduction of a meningococcal A conjugate vaccine through mass preventive campaigns (since 2010) and into routine immunization programmes (since 2016). Among vaccinated populations, incidence of serogroup A meningitis has declined by more than 99%, and no serogroup A case has been confirmed since 2017.However, cases of meningitis and outbreaks due to other meningococcal serogroups, apart from serogroup B, continue to strike.",
        "Public Health Response": "A technical committee has been established in the Zinder region to coordinate the response to the epidemic. The meningitis response plan has been finalized and implemented. An international team from WHO and other partners including MSF and UNICEF has been deployed to support the response.Surveillance system activities have been reinforced in the Zinder region especially in Dungass health district, including case investigations. Laboratory activities are ongoing, including sample collection and confirmation from suspected meningitis cases.Case management activities have been strengthened, including procurement of the antibiotic ceftriaxone, cases isolation, deployment of health workers for case management, distribution of case management guidelines and provision of free treatment to cases.A request for 608 960 doses of trivalent ACW polysaccharide vaccine was approved and delivered by the International Coordinating Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision in two batches of approximately 300 000 doses each on 31 December 2022 and 9 January 2023.Reactive vaccination campaigns with the trivalent ACW meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine have been implemented by the MoH with the support of WHO and The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) in the Health Districts of Dungass, Gour\u00e9, Mirriah and Matam\u00e8ye, targeting the age group 2 to 29 years. The overall vaccination coverage reached is 99.8%.Risks communication and community engagement activities are ongoing in close cooperation with administrators and community leaders in affected districts, delivering health advice and infection, prevention and control recommendations through community radios and other channels, including door-to-door sensitisation on the need to immediately seek medical assistance if symptoms occur to promptly start treatment.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "The ongoing outbreak shows both an increased number of cases and an increased growth rate compared to the previous seasons.Moreover, the meningitis epidemic season (usually from January to June, marked by high temperatures and dry winds combined with heavy dust, a period known as the harmattan), the mixing of populations, the simultaneous occurrence of other epidemics in the same region (measles, diphtheria and COVID-19), insecurity and population displacement, all in the context of a protracted humanitarian crisis, are likely to contribute to the spread of the outbreak.The Zinder region borders Jigawa State in Nigeria, where a NmC outbreak is also ongoing, confirming the risk of international spread to other countries of the West African subregion.WHO assesses the risk posed by the current meningitis outbreak in Niger as high at the national level, moderate at the regional level, and low at the global level.",
        "WHO Advice": "Meningococcal meningitis remains a public health concern with a high case fatality rate and leading to serious long-term complications.Preventing meningitis through vaccination is the most effective way to reduce the burden and impact of the disease by delivering long-lasting protection. The rollout of multivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccines is a public health priority to eliminate bacterial meningitis epidemics in the African meningitis belt. Introduction into routine immunization programmes and maintaining high coverage will be critical to avoid the resurgence of epidemics.Antibiotics for close contacts of meningococcal cases, when given promptly, decrease the risk of transmission. Outside the African meningitis belt, chemoprophylaxis is recommended for close contacts within the household. Within the meningitis belt, chemoprophylaxis for close contacts is recommended in non-epidemic situations. Ciprofloxacin is the antibiotic of choice, and ceftriaxone an alternative.Admission to a hospital or health centre is necessary. Isolation of the patient is not usually advised after 24 hours of treatment.Appropriate antibiotic treatment must be started as soon as possible. Ideally, lumbar puncture should be done first as antibiotics can make it more difficult to grow bacteria from the spinal fluid. However, blood sampling can also help to identify the cause and the priority is to start treatment without delay. A range of antibiotics is used to treat meningitis, including penicillin, ampicillin, and ceftriaxone. During epidemics of meningococcal and pneumococcal meningitis, ceftriaxone is the drug of choice.The response to epidemics consists of appropriate case management, active community-based case-finding and reactive mass vaccination of affected populations. Surveillance, from case detection to investigation and laboratory confirmation is essential to the control of meningitis.Reactive vaccination campaigns have been implemented in Zinder region, and monitoring the spread to new areas is crucial to guide further response activities, including considering further vaccine requests if appropriate. Timeliness of the reactive campaign is critical, ideally within four weeks of crossing the epidemic threshold.WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel and trade to Niger on the basis of the information available on the current event.",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 23 January 2023, the Paraguay IHR National Focal Point notified WHO of a measles case in a 14-month-old boy from Itap\u00faa Department, who had onset of fever and rash on 15 September 2022. The case was notified as a highly suspected case of measles in September 2022, and on 11 October 2022, the case was laboratory confirmed by the Central Public Health Laboratory (LCSP. as per its acronym in Spanish) in Paraguay. Although the case had no history of receiving routine vaccination as per the immunization schedule, one dose of MMR (MMR1) was given on 12 September 2022 as part of measles vaccination campaign conducted in the affected department between November 2021 to 16 December 2022 . Due to the history of recent vaccination, the case samples were sent to United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC) for further molecular analysis, which tested positive for measles and negative for measles vaccine strain on 10 January 2023. The case had no history of travel, however, 30 days prior to developing symptoms, he came into contact with a symptomatic family member, diagnosed as having an allergic reaction at the time, and who was a contact of a family member with a history of periodic travel to Buenos Aires, Argentina.\nControl measures, such as strengthening surveillance activities, were implemented by the local and national authorities as soon as the case was notified in September 2022.\nThis is the first case of measles reported in Paraguay since 1998.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 23 January 2023, the Paraguay IHR National Focal Point notified WHO of a confirmed case of measles in Itap\u00faa Department, Paraguay. Itap\u00faa is close to the southern border of the country with Argentina. The case is a 14-month-old boy who had onset of rash and fever on 15 September 2022. He had no travel history and had received one dose of MMR vaccine (MMR1) on 12 September 2022. According to the information received,\u00a0 30 days prior to onset of symptoms, \u00a0the case was in contact with a 16-month-old child, a symptomatic family contact, diagnosed as having an allergic reaction including fever, rhinorrhea and skin lesions. This symptomatic family contact was a contact of a family member with a history of periodic travel to Buenos Aires, Argentina.\u00a0 On 26 September 2022, a serum sample was collected and sent to LCSP which was reactive for measles by Immunoglobulin M ( IgM). On 11 October, a second serum sample was collected and sent to the LCSP and tested reactive for measles by IgM and IgG. Further, on 16 November, serum and urine samples were sent to the US CDC for confirmation, and additional molecular analysis was performed which tested positive for measles by reverse transcriptase \u2013 quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) on 10 January 2023, and negative for measles vaccine strain. In Paraguay, the official measles vaccination coverage for the first and second dose of measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR) in 2021 was reported to be \u00a056% and 55%, respectively, lower than the WHO recommended sustained homogeneous coverage of at least 95%. \u00a0The last National MMR Vaccination Campaign was conducted from November 2021 to 16 December 2022 including the department of Itap\u00faa.This is the first case of measles reported in Paraguay since 1998.",
        "Epidemiology": "Measles is a highly contagious viral disease, which affects susceptible individuals of all ages and remains one of the leading causes of death among young children globally. The mode of transmission is airborne or via droplets from the nose, mouth, or throat of infected persons. Initial symptoms, which usually appear 10-12 days after infection, include high fever, usually accompanied by one or several of the following symptoms: runny nose, bloodshot eyes, cough, and tiny white spots on the inside of the mouth. Several days later, a rash develops, usually starting on the face and upper neck and gradually spreading downwards. A patient is infectious four days before the start of the rash to four days after the appearance of the rash. There is no specific antiviral treatment for measles and most people recover within 2-3 weeks.Among malnourished children and immunocompromised people including people with HIV, cancer and treated with immunosuppressives, as well as pregnant women, measles can also cause serious complications, including blindness, encephalitis, severe diarrhea, ear infection, and pneumonia.Measles can be prevented by immunization. In countries with low administrative vaccination coverage, epidemics typically occur every two to three years and usually last between two and three months, although their duration varies according to population size, crowding, and the population\u2019s immunity status.",
        "Public Health Response": "The following public health measures were implemented by local and national health authorities: Intensified epidemiological surveillance through active and retrospective institutional case finding, contact tracing, and monitoring of contacts.\u00a0 Rapid assessment of vaccination coverage in the community, and if needed, rapidly deploying measles containing vaccine (MCV) in the field targeting those who have missed one or two doses of MCV.\u00a0 Additionally, in September 2022, a total of \u00a0181 people , between the age of one and 60 years and above, were surveyed in the surrounding area where the case was detected. Of these 181 people surveyed, 107 were vaccinated against measles and rubella, with a coverage of 59%.Training was provided to health care providers on case management and measles surveillance.Strengthening\u00a0 the laboratory networks.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "In 2016, the WHO Region of the Americas was the first Region of the World Health Organization (WHO) to be declared free of the endemic transmission of measles virus by the International Expert Committee (IEC) for documenting and verifying measles, rubella and the congenital rubella syndrome in the Americas. However, keeping the Region free of measles is an ongoing challenge due to the permanent risk of importation and reintroduction of the virus. In 2021, five countries and territories (countries hereafter) have achieved \u226595% coverage for the first dose of MMR (MMR1) in the Region of the Americas, while 13 countries had MMR1 coverage of less than 80%. For MMR2, only two countries had \u226595% coverage and 36 countries had less than 80% coverage.Several factors have contributed to the outbreaks of measles in the Region of the Americas occurring between 2017 and 2022, including lack of compliance with 2-dose measles vaccination coverage, influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. During the same period, there are gaps in the performance of international indicators for integrated measles/rubella surveillance. In Paraguay, risk of disruption to routine immunization activities remains due to both the COVID-19 related burden on the health system and decreased demand for measles vaccination because of physical distancing requirements or community reluctance. Disruption of immunization services, even for brief periods, can result in an increased number of susceptible individuals and raise the likelihood of outbreak-prone vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) such as measles.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO recommends strengthening efforts to implement the Plan of Action for the Sustainability of Measles, Rubella, and Congenital Rubella Syndrome Elimination in the Americas 2018-2023, with a focus on: 1) guaranteeing universal access to measles vaccination services; 2) strengthening the capacity of epidemiological surveillance systems for measles, rubella, and congenital rubella syndrome; 3) developing national operational capacity to maintain the elimination status; 4) establishing standard mechanisms for rapid response to imported measles, rubella, and congenital rubella syndrome cases, in order to prevent the re-establishment of endemic transmission in the Region\u2019s countries. To avoid the spread of measles beyond this case, WHO recommends maintaining sustained homogeneous coverage of at least 95% with the first and second doses of the MCV in all municipalities and strengthened surveillance to achieve timely detection of all suspected cases in public, private, and social security healthcare facilities. WHO recommends strengthened surveillance particularly in high-traffic border areas to rapidly detect and respond to highly suspected measles cases. WHO also recommends managing imported measles cases to avoid the re-establishment of endemic transmission through the activation of rapid response teams trained for this purpose, and by implementing national rapid response protocols when there are imported cases. Once a rapid response team has been activated, continued coordination between the national, sub-national and local levels must be ensured, with permanent and fluid communication channels between all levels. During outbreaks, it is recommended to establish adequate hospital case management in order to avoid nosocomial transmission, with appropriate referral of patients to isolation rooms (for any level of care) and avoiding contact with other patients in waiting rooms and/or other hospital rooms. WHO recommends vaccination of at-risk populations (without proof of vaccination or immunity against measles and rubella), such as healthcare workers, persons working in tourism and transportation (hotels, airports, border crossings, mass transportation, and others), as well as international travelers. Implementing a plan to immunize migrant populations in high-traffic border areas, prioritizing those considered at-risk, including both migrants and residents, to increase vaccination coverage in order to increase population immunity. WHO recommends maintaining a stock of the measles-rubella (MR) and/or MMR vaccine, and syringes/supplies for control actions of imported cases. Access to vaccination services should be facilitated, according to the national scheme, to foreigners; people from the same country who perform temporary activities in countries with ongoing outbreaks; displaced populations; indigenous populations, or other vulnerable populations. WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel and trade to Paraguay, based on the information available on the current outbreak.",

        "Outbreak name": "Human infection caused by avian influenza A(H5)",
        "Date Reported": "18 January 2023",
        "Location": "Ecuador",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 9 January 2023, WHO was notified of a human infection caused by an avian influenza A(H5) virus. The case, a nine-year-old girl, living in a rural area in the province of Bol\u00edvar, Ecuador, was in contact with backyard poultry, which was acquired a week before the onset of her symptoms. She is currently hospitalized, in isolation, and is being treated with antivirals.\nThis is the first reported case of human infection caused by avian influenza A(H5) virus in the Latin America and the Caribbean region. Work is ongoing to further characterize the virus.\nCurrently, available epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that influenza A(H5) viruses have not acquired the ability for sustained transmission among humans, thus the likelihood of human-to-human spread is low.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 9 January 2023, the Ecuador IHR National Focal Point (NFP) informed WHO of a human case of infection with an avian influenza A(H5) virus. The case was detected as part of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) sentinel surveillance and was confirmed by the National Influenza Centre (NIC), the National Institute of Public Health Research (INSPI per its acronym in Spanish).\u00a0The case is a nine-year-old girl, with no known comorbidities, from Bol\u00edvar Province, Ecuador. She developed symptoms of conjunctival pruritus and coryza on 25 December 2022. On 27 December, she was brought to a local health center for medical evaluation and treatment.\u00a0 On 30 December, due to the persistent symptoms including nausea, vomiting and constipation, she was admitted to a general hospital where empirical treatment for meningitis was started with antibiotics and antipyretics. On 3 January 2023, she was transferred to a pediatric hospital in critical condition where she was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with septic shock and was treated with antivirals and mechanical ventilation due to pneumonia.\u00a0\u00a0On 5 January, as part of SARI surveillance activities, a nasopharyngeal sample was collected from the patient. The sample was sent to INSPI and tested positive for influenza A(H5) by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on 7 January.\u00a0As of 17 January, the patient remains hospitalized, under isolation, and with noninvasive mechanical ventilation.According to the epidemiological investigation in response to the outbreak, a week before the onset of her symptoms, the family acquired poultry which died without apparent cause on 19 December 2022. In addition, the epidemiological investigations revealed that several incidents of dead backyard poultry (chickens and ducks) have been reported from the same community where the family resided.",
        "Epidemiology": "Zoonotic influenza infections in humans may be asymptomatic or may cause disease, from conjunctivitis or mild, flu-like symptoms to severe, acute respiratory disease or even death, depending on factors related to the virus causing infection and the infected host. Rarely, gastrointestinal or neurological symptoms have been reported.\u00a0Human cases of infection with avian influenza viruses are usually the result of direct or indirect exposure to infected live or dead poultry or contaminated environments.",
        "Public Health Response": "Public health measures from both human and animal health agencies have been implemented. These include:Local authorities carried out epidemiological investigations and follow-up of the case\u2019s contacts in the family, home, and health care facilities.Ongoing intersectoral activities with the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (MAG), and the Phytosanitary and Animal Health Regulation and Control Agency (Agrocalidad) for active detection, follow-up and control of avian influenza outbreaks in the area. Continuous follow-up of persons with respiratory symptoms and suspected influenza cases due to contact with poultry or/and who have been exposed to birds, among the exposed population.Seasonal influenza vaccination in risk groups is ongoing according to the guidelines of the National Immunization Program.The NIC is in the process of sending the patient\u2019s samples to a WHO Collaborating Center for further characterization.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "This is the first reported case of human infection caused by avian influenza A(H5) virus in Ecuador and in Latin America and the Caribbean. This human case was exposed to poultry, which died without apparent cause. Outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza have been detected recently in the provinces of Cotopaxi (influenza A(H5N1)) and Bol\u00edvar, Ecuador. Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk for sporadic infection and small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. Therefore, human cases are expected, although rare. According to the information received thus far, the virus has not been detected in other individuals beyond this single case. While further characterization of the virus from this case is pending, currently available epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that influenza A(H5) viruses have not acquired the ability for sustained transmission among humans, thus the likelihood of human-to-human spread is low. Based on available information, WHO assesses the risk to the general population posed by this virus to be low. The risk assessment will be reviewed as needed should further epidemiological or virological information become available.A global risk assessment associated with recent influenza A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b viruses was published on 21 December 2022. However, the subtype and clade information for this human case is not yet known. There are no approved vaccines for preventing influenza A(H5) in humans. Candidate vaccines to prevent influenza A(H5) infection in humans have been developed for pandemic preparedness purposes. Close analysis of the epidemiological situation, further characterization of the most recent viruses (human and poultry) and serological investigations are critical to assess associated risk and to adjust risk management measures in a timely manner.",
        "WHO Advice": "The reported case does not change the current WHO recommendations on public health measures and surveillance of influenza.WHO does not advise special traveler screening at points of entry or restrictions regarding the current situation of influenza viruses at the human-animal interface.Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect and monitor virological, epidemiological, and clinical changes associated with emerging or circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health, and timely virus sharing for risk assessment. The diversity of zoonotic influenza viruses that have caused human infections is alarming and necessitates strengthened surveillance in both animal and human populations, thorough investigation of every zoonotic infection and pandemic preparedness. Vaccination against seasonal influenza infection of selected groups at increased risk of exposure to animal influenza viruses could be considered as a measure to reduce opportunities for the simultaneous infection of humans with animal and human influenza viruses.In the case of a confirmed or suspected human infection caused by a novel influenza virus with pandemic potential, including a variant virus, the health authorities should be notified and appropriate clinical case management, including testing, triage, clinical assessment for disease severity classification, assessment of risk factors for severe disease and isolation and treatment (e.g., antivirals and supportive care) should be provided. A thorough epidemiologic investigation (even while awaiting the confirmatory laboratory results) of a history of exposure to animals, and travel, and contact tracing should be conducted.\u00a0 The epidemiologic investigation should include early identification of unusual respiratory events that could signal person-to-person transmission of the novel virus. Clinical samples should be tested and sent to a WHO Collaboration Centre for further characterization.Travelers to countries with known outbreaks of animal influenza should avoid farms, contact with animals in live animal markets, entering areas where animals may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with animal faeces. Travelers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travelers should follow good food safety and hygiene practices. Should infected individuals from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during travel or after arrival. If this were to occur, further community level spread is considered unlikely as this virus has not acquired the ability to transmit easily among humans.All human infections caused by a novel influenza subtype are notifiable under the International Health Regulations (IHR) and State Parties to the IHR (2005) are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic. Evidence of illness is not required for this notification.WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel and/or trade for Ecuador based on available information on this event.",

        "Outbreak name": "Ebola disease caused by Sudan ebolavirus",
        "Date Reported": "14 January 2023",
        "Location": "Uganda",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 11 January 2023, the Ministry of Health (MoH) of Uganda declared the end of the Ebola disease outbreak caused by the Sudan ebolavirus that affected nine districts. A total of 164 cases (142 confirmed, 22 probable) with 77 deaths (55 among confirmed cases and 22 among probable cases) were reported during the outbreak.\nIn accordance with WHO recommendations, the declaration was made 42 days (twice the maximum incubation period for Sudan ebolavirus infections) after the sample from the last admitted case that was collected on 29 November 2022 tested negative before discharge, and the last confirmed death was accorded a safe and dignified burial on 29 November 2022.\nAlthough the outbreak has been declared over, health authorities are maintaining surveillance to rapidly identify and respond to any re-emergence. A follow-up programme has been put in place to support survivors. Neighbouring countries remain on alert and are encouraged to continue strengthening their capacities to detect and respond to infectious disease outbreaks.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 11 January 2023, the Ministry of Health (MoH) of Uganda declared the end of the Ebola disease outbreak caused by the Sudan ebolavirus (SUDV) that affected nine out of 146 districts: Bunyangabu, Jinja, Kagadi, Kampala, Kassanda, Kyegegwa, Masaka, Mubende, and Wakiso. This declaration follows a 42-day period after the last confirmed case tested negative on 29 November 2022 and was released from care on 30 November, and the last confirmed death was accorded a safe and dignified burial on 29 November 2022. \u00a0Uganda declared an outbreak of Ebola disease caused by Sudan ebolavirus on 20 September 2022, after a case at Mubende Regional Referral Hospital (MRRH) in Mubende district was confirmed by the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI). In total,164 cases (142 confirmed, 22 probable) with 77 deaths (55 among confirmed cases and 22 among probable cases)\u00a0and 87 recovered patients, were reported.A higher proportion of cases occurred among males (59%), while the most affected age group was represented by those aged 20-29 years (31%), followed by those aged 30-39 years (30%). A quarter of cases were reported among children under 10 years old. Overall, 19 confirmed cases with seven deaths occurred among healthcare workers (HCWs).Mubende was the epicentre of the outbreak, accounting for 45% of confirmed cases (64 confirmed and 19 probable), followed by Kassanda with 35% of confirmed cases (49 confirmed and 2 probable), Kampala with 13% of confirmed cases (17 confirmed and 1 probable), Wakiso with 3% of confirmed cases (4 confirmed cases), Kyegegwa with 2% of confirmed cases (3 confirmed cases), Jinja with 1% of confirmed cases (2 confirmed cases), and Bunyangabo, Kagadi and Masaka, which reported one confirmed case each (Table 1).Table 1. Number of cases and deaths (confirmed and probable) of Ebola disease caused by SUDV, by district, as of 10 January 2023. From 20 September to 10 January 2023, a total of 4793 contacts were listed and 11 025 alerts were reported, of which 8088 (73%) were investigated and 7382 (67%) were validated as suspected cases of Ebola disease caused by Sudan ebolavirus.\u00a0During this period, 1087 safe and dignified burials (SDB) were undertaken (all suspected deaths had to be tested and accorded a SDB), and 6681 samples were tested for Sudan ebolavirus.\u00a0A total of 314 603 travelers were screened at international points of entry and four suspected cases of SUDV were detected, who all tested negative.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "Coordination: Uganda MoH, together with WHO and other partners, initiated response measures to control the outbreak and prevent further spread. The MoH activated the national and district emergency management committees to coordinate the response. Surveillance: WHO supported the MoH in the implementation of enhanced surveillance activities. Multidisciplinary teams were deployed to the field to actively search for cases, identify, list, and follow-up contacts for 21 days. Partner support: Following a Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) Request for Assistance, a total of 69 offers of support were received from 23 partner institutions. Eleven experts were deployed to the field and three are still supporting the response in the functions of case management, infection prevention and control (IPC), and Go.Data implementation (Go.Data is the initiative of a group of public health partners and is managed by the GOARN with the aim to provide an outbreak investigation tool for field data collection during public health emergencies).Over USD 27 million was mobilized from Development Partners in cash and in-kind contributions including from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), UK Aid, Norwegian Government, Novo Nordisk Foundation, The Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), Irish Aid, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), The Directorate-General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (DG ECHO), Sweden, Luxemburg, the Republic of Korea and donors contributing to the WHO Contingency Emergency Funds (CFE).Vaccination trial: WHO convened an expert meeting to prioritize candidate vaccines. In coordination with Ugandan researchers, health authorities, and regulators, a ring vaccination trial protocol was developed and locally approved. Three candidate vaccines were identified and over 5000 doses of these arrived in the country with the first batch on 8 December and the last two on 17 December.Survivor Care Programme: Out of the 142 confirmed cases, 87 survivors were registered. An Ebola Survivors program (ESP) has been established following WHO guidance on clinical care for survivors of Ebola virus disease, with the goal to improve the wellbeing of survivors by integrating survivor health care into the National MoH System. WHO led the ESP planning, supported the needs assessments, and the establishment of three clinics, located in geographical areas where survivors are residing. Two of the three clinics are already operational. All survivors have had at least one clinical evaluation and have received at least one psychosocial support session with the clinic and community teams respectively.Laboratory and clinical case management: WHO, GOARN, and partners supported the MoH in the establishment of screening, triage, isolation and care areas at designated reference hospitals in affected districts to identify suspected patients; and also supported the establishment of Ebola treatment centres in affected districts, and Ebola testing mobile laboratories. Treatment centres have been equipped with essential medicines and supplies to deliver safe, optimized supportive care, including personal protective equipment (PPE), monitoring devices, point-of-care laboratory testing, intravenous fluids, and supportive oxygen devices. WHO and GOARN deployed clinical experts and organized bio-secured, patient flow circuits that allowed close monitoring of cases. Over time, isolation areas and treatment centres were able to manage both suspected and confirmed patients according to WHO guidelines and standards. For confirmed patients, access to investigational products was provided within the locally approved expanded access protocols under the MEURI ethical framework while the Randomized Clinical Trial (RTC) protocol was under development.Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE) activities: WHO supported RCCE activities and awareness campaigns implemented by the MoH, as messages run by local radio stations, social media messages, door to door sensitisation of communities. A festive season RCCE plan was also developed to orient RCCE activities in Uganda and prevention in neighboring countries.Preparedness in neighboring countries: Ministries of Health, WHO, in-country and international partners, supported Sudan Virus Disease (SVD) preparedness and operational readiness activities in neighboring countries that were identified as at-risk through risk assessments (Burundi, Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Rwanda, and Tanzania).Over 2000 health workers were trained during the outbreak on IPC, psychosocial support and care for both patients and affected families, and enhanced clinical care for SVD patients.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "The outbreak is declared over, with no new cases reported for 42 consecutive days.This outbreak is not unexpected given that SVD is enzootic, present in animal reservoirs in the region.\u00a0 Uganda reported four SVD outbreaks in 2000, 2011, and two in 2012 prior to this last one in 2022, in addition to two Ebola outbreaks caused by the Zaire ebolavirus in 2007 and 2018. It is therefore likely that the filoviruses are present in the wild animal reservoir in the region. Thus, the risk of re-emergence of any filoviruses through exposure to an animal host or from a persistent virus cannot be excluded.This outbreak showed that re-emergence of SVD is a major public health concern in Uganda.\u00a0 Strengthening of surveillance capacities can help to detect future outbreaks preventing further spread.Ebola is a severe, often fatal illness affecting humans. While licensed therapeutics and vaccines are available, in limited numbers, to treat and prevent infections of Zaire ebolavirus, there are currently no licensed vaccines or therapeutics for SUDV.WHO considers that ongoing challenges in terms of epidemiological surveillance, infection prevention and control programs and practices in health care settings, coupled with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as ongoing outbreaks, such as Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF), Rift Valley fever, yellow fever, cholera, and measles, might jeopardize the country\u2019s ability to rapidly detect and respond to any re-emergence.",
        "WHO Advice": "Successful SVD outbreak control relies on applying a package of interventions, including case management, early supportive care, risk communication and community engagement, surveillance and contact tracing, strengthening laboratory capacity, safe and dignified burials.Although the outbreak has been declared over, WHO advises health authorities to maintain surveillance activities in place. Neighbouring countries are encouraged to remain on alert and continue strengthening their capacities to detect and respond to infectious disease outbreaks.WHO advises the following risk reduction measures as an effective way to reduce SVD and other the transmission of other Ebolavirus diseases in humans:To reduce the risk of wildlife-to-human transmission\u00a0from contact with wild animals such as infected fruit bats or non-human primates and the consumption of their raw meat, animals should be handled with gloves and other appropriate protective clothing. Meat should be thoroughly cooked before consumption.To reduce the risk of human-to-human transmission from direct or close contact with people with Ebola symptoms, particularly with their bodily fluids, people in affected communities should be encouraged to continue frequent hand hygiene including when entering or visiting health facilities and to remain alert for symptoms of Ebola. To reduce the risk of possible transmission from virus persistence in some body fluids, WHO recommends that recovered patients are provided with medical care, psychological support, and biological testing (until two consecutive negative tests) through an SVD survivors care programme.\u00a0 WHO does not recommend isolation of convalescent patients whose blood has tested negative for SVD.To prevent future amplification of transmission through health care, it\u2019s recommended to strengthen IPC programmes within the health care system. Healthcare workers should always follow standard precautions when caring for patients, regardless of their presumed diagnosis. Implementation of IPC measures in health care (e.g. hand hygiene, training of health workers, adequate PPE supplies, waste management, environmental cleaning, and disinfection etc.) with ongoing monitoring and supervision is required.Provide training of the multi-disciplinary health workforce for early detection, isolation, and treatment of SVD cases as well as re-training on safe and dignified burials and the IPC ring approach.Ensuring the provision of safe and dignified burials, supporting IPC in community settings (including adequate water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) facilities, hand hygiene capacity and safe waste management), implementing community engagement and social mobilization activities, are essential to prevent future transmission.Maintain capacities for logistic support in at-risk areas or countries, including supply chain (stockpiles) for essential medicines and supplies to deliver optimized supportive care for suspected and confirmed patients.Collect, analyse and report the clinical characterization of SVD patients in order to better understand the clinical phenotypes and presentation and care for patients in future outbreaks.\u00a0 Use of WHO Global clinical platform is recommended.Maintain capacities to surge SVD clinical care in case of future outbreaks; this includes screening protocols, referral pathways, SVD clinical guidelines, trained multidisciplinary staff for clinical surge, and designated infrastructure/health care sites that can provide patient-centered and community-acceptable SVD care that meets quality standards. Maintain capacities to surge and implement clinical trials on therapeutics using WHO RCT protocol in case of future outbreaks.Based on the current risk assessment and prior evidence on Ebola outbreaks, WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to Uganda.",

        "Outbreak name": "Yellow fever",
        "Date Reported": "3 January 2023",
        "Location": "African Region (AFRO)",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "This is an update on the yellow fever situation in the WHO African Region since the last disease outbreak news was published on 2 September 2022.\nFrom 1 January 2021 to 7 December 2022, a total of 203 confirmed and 252 probable cases with 40 deaths (Case Fatality Ratio 9%) were reported to WHO from 13 countries in the WHO African Region.\nRisk factors for further yellow fever spread and amplification include low population immunity, population movements, viral transmission dynamics, and climate and environmental factors that have contributed to the spread of Aedes mosquitoes. Recent Reactive Vaccination Campaigns increase population immunity and may have contributed to reducing the risk of yellow fever spread in targeted countries, resulting in a gradual downward trend in reported confirmed cases in 2022. However, the countries remain at high risk.",
        "Description of the Situation": "In 2022, 12 countries in the WHO African Region have reported confirmed cases of yellow fever (Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, Kenya, Niger, Nigeria,\u00a0the Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone and Uganda). Eight of these countries are experiencing a continuation of transmission from 2021 (Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, Nigeria, and the Republic of the Congo) and four countries are newly reporting confirmed cases (Kenya, Niger, Sierra Leone and Uganda). One country, Gabon, reported an isolated confirmed case in 2021, but no further cases were registered in 2022.Since 2021, a total of 203 confirmed and 252 probable cases with 40 deaths and a CFR of 9% have been reported. Of these, 23 deaths have been reported among confirmed cases (CFR among confirmed cases 11%) (Table 1). The high overall CFR among confirmed cases in 2021 (17 deaths, 11%) continued in 2022 (six deaths, 12%).The male-to-female ratio among confirmed cases is not significantly different in 2021 and 2022 (1.3 and 1.6 respectively). The most affected age group amongst confirmed cases in 2021 was 10 years and below; meanwhile, the most affected group in 2022 is 20 to 30 years old. Overall, about 71% of confirmed cases are aged 30 years and below, and children aged 10 years and below are disproportionately affected. According to the WHO/UNICEF Estimates of National Immunization Coverage (WUENIC), in 2021 routine immunization coverage against yellow fever in the African Region for childhood vaccinations was 48%, much lower than the 80% threshold required to confer population immunity against yellow fever, indicating the presence of an underlying susceptible population at risk of yellow fever and the risk of continued transmission. Country-specific estimates of vaccination coverage for 2021 are 54% in Cameroon, 41% in the Central African Republic, 45% in Chad, 67% in the Republic of the Congo, 65% in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, 56% in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 64% in Gabon, 94% in Ghana, 7% in Kenya, 80% in Niger (subnational introduction limited to four counties in 2021), 63% in Nigeria and 85% in Sierra Leone. Uganda has recently rolled-out yellow fever into the Routine Immunization programme.Increasing population immunity through past and ongoing\u00a0Preventive Mass Vaccination Campaigns (PMVC) supported through the EYE Strategy, and Reactive Vaccination Campaigns (RVC) have increased population immunity rapidly in implementing countries which has contributed to reducing the risk of spread of yellow fever in targeted countries. This may contribute to the gradual downward trend in reported confirmed cases in 2022, but should be noted that there is also variation in virus transmission dynamics that are difficult to predict.

        "Epidemiology": "Yellow fever is an epidemic-prone, vaccine-preventable disease caused by an arbovirus transmitted to humans by the bites of infected Aedes and Haemagogus mosquitoes. The incubation period ranges from 3 to 6 days. Many people do not experience symptoms, but when they occur, the most common are fever, muscle pain with prominent back pain, headache, loss of appetite, and nausea or vomiting. In most cases, symptoms disappear after 3 to 4 days. A small percentage of cases progress to a toxic phase with systemic infection affecting the liver and kidneys. These individuals can have more severe symptoms of high-grade fever, abdominal pain with vomiting, jaundice and dark urine caused by acute liver and kidney failure. Bleeding can occur from the mouth, nose, eyes, or stomach.\u00a0 Death can occur within 7 - 10 days in about half of cases with severe symptoms.Yellow fever is prevented by an effective vaccine, which is safe and affordable. A single dose of yellow fever vaccine is sufficient to grant sustained immunity and life-long protection against yellow fever disease. A booster dose of the vaccine is not needed. The vaccine provides effective immunity within 10 days for 80-100% of people vaccinated, and within 30 days for more than 99% of people vaccinated.",
        "Public Health Response": "Surveillance and Laboratory.WHO provides support to national health authorities in conducting field investigations and determining the epidemiological classification of yellow fever cases. A total of 51 personnel from at least 10 countries have been trained to investigate confirmed or probable cases of yellow fever. Furthermore, case investigation reports were reviewed, and feedback was provided to field teams to assess disease exposure and risk of disease spread. An innovative programme to facilitate the international shipment of yellow fever samples to regional reference laboratories, as well as laboratory testing and capacity building, has been initiated with support from the EYE Strategy.\u00a0 WHO is engaged in ongoing activities to support countries in the laboratory diagnosis of yellow fever, including periodic accreditation visits and capacity development.Reactive vaccinationSince the beginning of the current outbreak (2021 to 7 December 2022), a total of 4 385 320 persons have been vaccinated in five countries: Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, Ghana and Kenya, as part of the ICG-supported response. Nine ICG requests for vaccination campaigns were approved for Cameroon (one request), the Central African Republic (two requests), Chad (two requests), Ghana (two requests), Kenya (one request), and Niger (one request).Reactive campaign conducted in Kembe Satema in the Central African Republic\u00a0from 2 to 19 November 2022 had 101.7% coverage. Based on preliminary results, the campaign in Bambari, the Central African Republic, which ended on 23 November 2022, had 87.7% coverage. Final results are pending from an ICG-supported RVC in Niger, which is anticipated to protect approximately 1.1 million people. Preventive mass campaign vaccination Most priority countries have conducted a PMVC against yellow fever or are in process. Gabon, Kenya, and Niger have not planned PMVCs, however, they are included in the EYE Strategy as priority countries. Approximately 50 million people are expected to be protected by PMVCs conducted in 2022.Chad: The country\u00a0has prepared an application for a PMVC to be submited in January 2023. Weekly risk analysis sessions supported by the EYE Strategy have been conducted since 18 October 2022 to inform the planning of priority areas for the PMVC.The Republic of the Congo: PMVC for yellow fever and measles integrated vaccination was organized from 5 to 14 August 2022 in 11 out of 12 departments with a coverage of 93% for yellow fever (preliminary report). The final report of the campaign and the mandatory Post Campaign Coverage Survey (PCCS) are pending.The Democratic Republic of the Congo: Eight provinces have organized preventive campaigns in 2021 including Bas-Uele, Equateur, Haut-Uele, Mongala, Nord-Ubangi, Sud-Ubangi, Tshopo and Tshuapa. Three provinces have been scheduled to conduct preventive campaigns from the end of November 2022 through January 2023, and include Maniema, Sankuru and Sud Kivu.Nigeria: The country has entered its final phases of PMVCs. In 2022 alone, campaigns have been conducted in Adamawa, Borno (special approach), Enugu, Gombe, Kano and Ogun States. Bayelsa State is planned for early 2023.\u00a0 The country is anticipated to complete nation-wide PMVCs by 2024.Uganda: The country introduced yellow fever vaccination into routine immunization in late October 2022. In addition, 10 of 13 million vaccine doses have been received for PMVC, the rest were expected at the end of November 2022 but have not yet been received. PMVC has been planned for late January 2023.\u00a0Prevention of International Spread and Points of Entry (PoE)All 13 countries that reported confirmed cases have implemented requirements for proof of vaccination against yellow fever as a condition for entry. Ten countries require proof of vaccination against yellow fever for any traveller, regardless of the origin of their voyage; whereas three countries (Chad, Kenya, and Nigeria) require proof of vaccination against yellow fever for travellers arriving from countries with areas at risk for yellow fever transmission as determined by the WHO Secretariat.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Between 26 August 2022 and 29 November 2022, there have been 22 additional confirmed cases of yellow fever reported from ten countries. However, based on retrospective classification of the cases, there were only seven new confirmed cases and one death. Countries including Burkina Faso, Senegal and Togo have reported probable cases that were subsequently discarded, indicating that there is enhanced surveillance put in place. However, there is still persistent yellow fever virus circulation, as several of the recent confirmations have been from locations with little or no underlying immunity (e.g., near urban areas in Cameroon and Uganda; areas with no history of yellow fever vaccination such as Isiolo county, Kenya) hard-to-reach and under-served populations, including children that have been disproportionately impacted. Based on the current situation of yellow fever in the WHO African region, the risk at the regional level was re-assessed as moderate on 12 December 2022 (high in November 2021 and June 2022) due to: 1. The decrease in the number of reported cases and the increasing population immunity, since there are ongoing and recent preventive vaccination campaigns, as well as reactive campaigns that have been organized in the affected countries, with more than four million people vaccinated in five countries (Ghana, Cameroon, Chad, the Central African Republic and Kenya), and an estimated 50 million people immunized during the PMVCs in 2021-2022 (Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Republic of the Congo) supported by the EYE Strategy. 2. There is ongoing yellow fever virus circulation in some high-risk areas, the most recent cases, and outbreaks are reported in areas impacted by underlying risk factors, including gaps in routine immunization, missed special populations (e.g., nomadic or pastoralists and other mobile populations), security and access challenges. 3. Most confirmed cases were reported in the last quarter of 2021, however several of the recent confirmations have been from urban areas and/or locations with little or no underlying immunity (e.g., near urban areas in Cameroon and Uganda; areas with no history of yellow fever vaccination); 4. Case classifications, and response operations remain a challenge; 5. Delays in detection and investigation; delays in the implementation of previously planned PMVC, competing outbreaks and pandemics of COVID-19 and Mpox that are attracting more attention in yellow fever-affected countries, and security constraints in affected areas (the Central African Republic, far North of Cameroon, Eastern - the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Northern Nigeria), population movement, all present risks that could lead to new yellow fever transmission.The overall global risk remains low, as no cases related to this current outbreak have been reported at this stage outside of the African region. However, there are favorable ecosystems for yellow fever outside the African region, especially in the neigbouring countries in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region. There might be challenges in surveillance and immunization capacities due to the potential onward transmission through viremic travellers and due to the presence of the competent vector, if not detected in a timely way.The impact on public health will persist until the ongoing outbreaks are controlled, vaccination coverage is high and immunity gaps in the population are closed. The importation of cases to countries with suboptimal coverage and persisting population immunity gaps poses a high risk and may jeopardize the tremendous efforts invested to achieve elimination.",
        "WHO Advice": "Transmission can be amplified in circumstances where the\u00a0Aedes\u00a0mosquitos (day feeder) are present in urban settings and densely populated areas causing rapid spread of the disease.Surveillance:\u00a0WHO recommends close monitoring of the situation with active cross-border coordination and information sharing, due to the possibility of cases in neighboring countries. Enhanced surveillance with investigation and laboratory testing of suspect cases is recommended.Vaccination:\u00a0Vaccination is the primary means for the prevention and control of yellow fever. Yellow fever vaccines approved by WHO are safe, highly effective, and provide life-long protection against infection. The countries reporting yellow fever cases and outbreaks are all high-priority countries for the EYE Strategy. The EYE Strategy recommends that all high-risk countries introduce yellow fever vaccination into their routine immunization (RI) schedule for those aged 9 months (Ethiopia, South Sudan have yet to introduce it into RI). Review of the risk analysis and scope of immunization activities to protect the population could help avert the risk of future outbreaks (e.g. Kenya).To protect populations in high-risk areas in the longer term, it is important to continue the roll-out of Preventive Mass Vaccination Campaigns (PMVCs) and bolster Routine Immunization (RI), as well as take steps to strengthen the application of International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) and bolster surveillance for rapid detection aligned to EYE objectives.WHO recommends vaccination for all international travellers, aged 9 months and older, going to areas determined by the WHO Secretariat as at risk for yellow fever transmission and for additional areas the recommendation for vaccination of international travellers is subject to the assessment of the likelihood of exposure of each individual traveller.Yellow fever vaccination is safe, highly effective and a single dose provides life-long protection.\u00a0 Yellow fever vaccination is not recommended for infants younger than 9 months, except during epidemics when the risk of yellow fever virus transmission may be very high. The risks and benefits of vaccination in this age group should be carefully considered before vaccination. The vaccine should be used with caution during pregnancy or breastfeeding. However, pregnant or breastfeeding women may be vaccinated during epidemics or if travel to a country or area with a risk of transmission is unavoidable.According to the provisions of the International Health Regulations (IHR), any country may decide to implement the requirement for proof of vaccination against yellow fever for arriving travellers. For international travel purposes, the proof of vaccination against yellow fever is only valid if recorded in the International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis. The International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis becomes valid 10 days after vaccination against yellow fever and extends for the life of the person vaccinated with a WHO-approved vaccine. A booster dose of the yellow fever vaccine cannot be required of international travellers as a condition of entry.Vector control:\u00a0In urban centres, targeted vector control measures are also helpful to interrupt transmission. As a general precaution, WHO recommends avoidance of mosquito bites, including the use of repellents and insecticide-treated mosquito nets. The highest risk for transmission of yellow fever virus is during the day and early evening.Risk communication:\u00a0WHO encourages its Member States to take all actions necessary to keep travellers well informed of risks and preventive measures including vaccination. Travellers should be made aware of yellow fever symptoms and signs and instructed to rapidly seek medical advice if presenting signs and symptoms suggestive of yellow fever infection. Infected returning travellers may pose a risk for the establishment of local cycles of yellow fever transmission in areas where a competent vector is present.International travel and trade:\u00a0WHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions to the Region.\u00a0The updated areas at-risk for yellow fever transmission and the related recommendations for vaccination of international travellers were updated by WHO on 1 July 2020; the map of revised areas at risk and yellow fever vaccination recommendations is available on the WHO International Travel and Health website.",
