        "Description of the Situation": "Weekly update\n\n30 December 2009 -\nAs of 27 December 2009, worldwide more than 208 countries and overseas territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including at least 12220 deaths. \n\nWHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and through monitoring of multiple sources of data. \nSituation update: \n\nThe most active areas of pandemic influenza transmission currently are in central and eastern Europe. Focal increases in rates of ILI/ARI during recent weeks were reported in at least three eastern European countries, Georgia, Montenegro, and Ukraine. A high intensity of respiratory diseases activity with concurrent circulation of pandemic influenza persists in parts of southern and eastern Europe, particularly in Greece, Poland, Bulgaria, Serbia, Ukraine, and the Urals Region of the Russian Federation. In Western Europe, influenza transmission remains active and widespread, but overall disease activity has peaked. At least 13 of 21 countries (testing more than 20 sentinel samples) reported that 30% or more of sentinel specimens were positive for influenza, down from a peak of over 70%. All were influenza viruses detected in Western Europe were pandemic H1N1 2009, however, very small numbers of seasonal influenza viruses, making up less than 1% of all influenza viruses detected, were reported in Russia. In addition, limited available data indicates that active, high intensity transmission is occurring in Northern African countries along the Mediterranean coast (Algeria, Tunisia, and Egypt).\n\nIn Central Asia, limited data suggest that influenza virus circulation remains active, but transmission may have recently peaked in some places. In West Asia, Israel, Iran, Iraq, Oman, and Afghanistan also appear to have passed their peak period of transmission within the past month, though both areas continue to have some active transmission and levels of respiratory disease activity have not yet returned to baseline levels. \n\nIn East Asia, influenza transmission remains active but appears to be declining overall. Influenza/ILI activity continued to decline in Japan, in northern and southern China, Chinese Taipei, and Hong Kong SAR (China). Slight increases in ILI were reported in Mongolia after weeks of declining activity following a large peak of activity over one month ago. In southern Asia, influenza activity continues to be intense, particularly in northern India, Nepal, and, Sri Lanka. Seasonal influenza A (H3N2) viruses are still being detected in very small numbers in China making up about 2.5% of the influenza A viruses detected there.\n\nIn North America, influenza transmission remains widespread but has declined substantially in all countries. In the US, sentinel outpatient ILI activity has returned to the seasonal baseline, and indicators of severity, including hospitalizations, paediatric mortality, and P&I mortality have declined substantially since peaking during late October. Rates of hospitalization among cases aged 5-17 years and 18-49 year far exceeded rates observed during recent influenza seasons, while rates of hospitalizations among cases aged >65 years were far lower than those observed during recent influenza seasons. \n\nIn the tropical regions of Central and South America and the Caribbean, influenza transmission remains geographically widespread but overall disease activity has been declining or remains unchanged in most parts, except for focal increases in respiratory disease activity in a few countries.In the temperate regions of the southern hemisphere, sporadic cases of pandemic influenza continued to be reported without evidence of sustained community transmission.\n\nThe Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN) continues monitoring the global circulation of influenza viruses, including pandemic, seasonal and other influenza viruses infecting, or with the potential to infect, humans including seasonal influenza.

        "Description of the Situation": "Weekly update\n\n23 December 2009 -\nAs of 20 December 2009, worldwide more than 208 countries and overseas territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including at least 11516 deaths. \n\nWHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and through monitoring of multiple sources of data. \nSituation update: \n\nIn the temperate zone* of the northern hemisphere, transmission of pandemic influenza virus remains active and geographically widespread, however overall disease activity has recently peaked in much of the hemisphere. There continues to be increases in influenza activity in later affected areas of central and eastern Europe, and in parts of west, central, and south Asia. \n\nIn United States and Canada, influenza activity continues to be geographically widespread but overall levels of ILI** have declined substantially to near the national baseline level in the US and below the seasonal baseline in Canada. Although numbers of hospitalizations and death in US have declined steadily since their peak over 6 weeks ago, the proportional mortality due to pneumonia and influenza (P&I mortality) remains elevated above the epidemic threshold for the 11th consecutive week. In Canada, rates of ILI, numbers of outbreaks, and proportions of samples testing positive for influenza have declined substantially since peaking six weeks ago. Approximately 53% of hospitalized cases in Canada had an underlying medical condition; cases with underlying medical conditions tended to be older (compared to those without), and were at increased risk of hospitalization and death. Also from Canada, a smaller proportion of hospitalized cases during the winter transmission season compared with those hospitalized cases during the summer transmission season, were persons of aboriginal origin (3.9% vs. 20.3%). \n\nIn Europe, geographically widespread and active transmission of pandemic influenza virus continued to be observed throughout the continent, however, overall pandemic influenza activity appears to have recently peaked across a majority of countries. At least ten countries reported that 30% or more of their sentinel respiratory specimens had tested positive for influenza. Greater than 98% of subtyped influenza A viruses detected in Europe were pandemic H1N1 2009, however, seasonal influenza viruses (H1N1, H3N2, and type B) continue to be detected at low levels. Of note, a few countries are experiencing increasing disease activity and have yet to peak (Hungary and Montenegro ), while several others are experiencing a resurgence in activity (Serbia, Ukraine, Georgia, and Turkey). Rates of ILI have returned to near seasonal baselines in the earlier affected areas of western Europe (Belgium, the Netherlands, Ireland, and Iceland) and a substantial decline in activity has been observed in much of northern Europe over the past month. In central and southern Europe, where influenza virus transmission has been most active recently, disease activity in most places has either plateaued (Albania, Czech Republic, Estonia) or begun to decline (Austria, Germany, Poland, Latvia, Croatia, Slovakia, and Greece). Further east, influenza activity appears to be variable, with the Russian Federation reporting a steady decline in rates of ARI after a recent peak three weeks ago; while several other countries are reporting increases in rates of ILI/ARI (Ukraine and Georgia). In Europe, the highest rates of ILI have been recorded among children 0-4 years of age (in 15 countries) and among older children 5-14 years of age (in 18 countries). Detections of RSV in Europe continued to increase over the past six weeks, partially accounting for elevated ILI activity among young children in some countries.\n\nIn Western and Central Asia, limited data suggest that influenza virus circulation remains active throughout the region, however disease trends remain variable. Increasing respiratory diseases activity continued to be reported in Kazakhstan and in Egypt; while several others countries, Israel and Oman, have been reporting declining trends of respiratory diseases activity after recording a peak of activity approximately one month ago.\n\nIn East Asia, the situation remains similar to last week; influenza transmission remains active but appears to be declining overall. Influenza/ILI activity has recently peaked and continues to decline in Japan, in northern and southern China, Chinese Taipei and in Mongolia. In southern Asia, influenza activity continues to increase in the northern India, Nepal, and, Sri Lanka. \n\nIn the tropical region of Central and South America and the Caribbean, influenza transmission remains geographically widespread but overall disease activity has been declining or remains unchanged in most parts, except for in Barbados and Ecuador, were recent increases in respiratory diseases activity have been reported. \n\nIn the temperate region of the southern hemisphere, sporadic cases of pandemic influenza continued to be reported without evidence of sustained community transmission.\n\n The Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN) continues monitoring the global circulation of influenza viruses, including pandemic, seasonal and other influenza viruses infecting, or with the potential to infect, humans including seasonal influenza.

In the US, proportional mortality due to pneumonia and influenza (P&I mortality) has remained consistently elevated above the epidemic threshold for the past 10 weeks; however, weekly numbers of lab-confirmed hospitalizations and deaths continue to decline over the past month. \n\nThe preliminary analysis of data from Northern Hemisphere countries that have now passed through an entire season of winter transmission indicate that the mortality rate, as expressed in fatal cases per million people, is in the same range as that which was observed in the Southern Hemisphere winter. This would indicate that the overall severity of the pandemic has not changed although the proportion of the population infected has been much higher in the temperate countries of the Northern Hemisphere during their winter season compared to the circulation observed in their summer season.\n\nIn Europe, geographically widespread and active transmission of pandemic influenza virus continued to be observed across the continent. At least 10 countries, mostly in western and northern Europe, reported declining respiratory disease activity. During the last reporting period, ILI/ARI activity continued to increase or reach a plateau in a limited number of countries: the Czech Republic, Estonia,, Hungary, Montenegro and Switzerland (a range of 28-71% of sentinel respiratory samples were positive for influenza in these countries). A high intensity of respiratory disease activity was reported in parts of northern and south-eastern Europe and in parts of the Russian Federation. 99% of subtyped influenza A viruses in Europe were pandemic H1N1 2009. Detections of RSV in Europe continued to increase over the past five weeks, partially accounting for elevated ILI activity among young children in some countries.\n\nIn Western and Central Asia, influenza transmission remains active. ILI/ARI activity continues to increase in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, and has peaked in some countries including in Afghanistan, Oman, and Israel. Influenza virus continues to circulate in Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Egypt and in much of the surrounding region but may have recently peaked in some parts. \n\nIn East Asia, influenza transmission remains active but appears to be declining overall. Influenza activity has recently peaked and begun to decline in Japan. ILI activity continued to decline but remained elevated in northern and southern China, Chinese Taipei and in Mongolia.

        "Description of the Situation": "Weekly update\n\n11 December 2009 -\nAs of 6 December 2009, worldwide more than 208 countries and overseas territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including at least 9596 deaths. \n\nAs many countries have stopped counting individual cases, particularly of milder illness, the case count is likely to be significantly lower than the actual number of cases that have occurred. WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and through monitoring of multiple sources of data. \nSituation update: \n\nIn the temperate zone* of the northern hemisphere, pandemic influenza activity has passed its peak in North America and in parts of western, northern, and eastern Europe, but activity continues to increase in parts of central and southeastern Europe, as well as in south and east Asia. Influenza transmission remains active in much of western and central Asia and there is evidence of pandemic virus circulation in most regions of Africa.\n\nIn United States and Canada, active influenza virus transmission persists but overall ILI** activity continues to decline for the 5th and 3rd consecutive weeks, respectively. In the US, after 8 weeks of increases, proportional mortality due to pneumonia and influenza (P&I mortality) has begun to decrease but remains elevated above the epidemic threshold; weekly numbers of lab-confirmed hospitalizations and deaths have also recently begun to decline. So far, comparing transmission during the current winter season to transmission during the summer season, there appears to be 2-3 times more hospitalized cases and deaths in the United States and approximately 4-5 times more hospitalized cases and deaths in Canada during the winter season. However, the overall rate of hospitalization and death in the population is similar to that which was observed in temperate countries of the southern hemisphere during their winter. This would indicate that transmission of the virus has been much more widespread and intense during the winter, as predicted, but overall rates of severe illness have not changed compared to southern hemisphere. Similar to seasonal influenza, persons with certain underlying conditions (compared to those without) were at significantly increased risk of hospitalization and death associated with pandemic H1N1 2009 virus infection. During the current winter season in Canada, 52% of hospitalized cases, 60% of cases requiring ICU, and 67% of fatal cases, had a underlying chronic medical illness. Similar to the experience of many countries, the most common underlying conditions among fatal cases in Canada were asthma followed by chronic cardiac disease, immunosuppression, and diabetes.\n\nIn Europe, geographically widespread transmission of pandemic influenza virus continued to be observed across the continent. With the exception of France where ILI activity continues to increase, ILI activity has peaked or passed its peak in much of western Europe, including in Belgium, Iceland, Ireland, Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Germany. In northern Europe, intensity remains high, however activity has begun to decline in Norway, Sweden, and Denmark. Increasing activity continues to be observed in parts of central and southeastern Europe, including in Albania, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Poland, Romania, Montenegro, Slovenia, and Turkey. Further east, declining rates of ILI or ARI have been observed in Georgia, Bulgaria, and Ukraine. In the Russian Federation, influenza virus circulation remains active, but overall activity may have recently peaked. A high intensity of respiratory diseases activity was reported in Lithuania and Greece, and a moderate impact on the healthcare system was reported in France and in parts of northern and far eastern Europe. 99% of subtyped influenza A viruses in Europe were pandemic H1N1 2009. Of note, detections of RSV in Europe have increased over the past four weeks which may partially account for elevated ILI activity among young children.\n\nIn Western and Central Asia, influenza virus transmission remains active. ILI/ARI activity continues to increase in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, but may have peaked in Afghanistan, Israel, and Oman. Pandemic influenza virus continues to circulate in Iran, Iraq, Jordan, and in much of the surrounding region. \n\nIn East Asia, influenza transmission remains variable. Influenza activity continues to increase in Japan and has recently begun to increase in Hong Kong SAR and Chinese Taipei both of which previously experienced a peak of transmission. Elevated but stable ILI activity has been reported in southern China, but declines in activity continue to be observed in northern China and Mongolia. In South Asia, influenza activity has begun to increase in the north-western parts of India and in Sri Lanka. Small number of seasonal influenza viruses continue to be detected in Asia but in decreasing amounts.\n\nIn the tropical region of Central and South America and the Caribbean, influenza transmission remains geographically widespread but overall disease activity has been declining in most areas.\n\nIn Africa, limited data suggest that pandemic H1N1 2009 virus continues to be detected from all parts of the continent (except South Africa where the winter season has passed). Pandemic H1N1 2009 virus appears to be the predominant influenza virus circulating in northern and eastern Africa. \n\nIn the temperate region of the southern hemisphere, sporadic cases of pandemic influenza have been reported in recent weeks but no sustained local transmission has been observed. \n\nThe Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN) continues monitoring the global circulation of influenza viruses, including pandemic, seasonal and other influenza viruses infecting, or with the potential to infect, humans including seasonal influenza.

        "Description of the Situation": "Weekly update\n\n4 December 2009 -\nAs of 29 November 2009, worldwide more than 207 countries and overseas territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including at least 8768 deaths. \n\nAs many countries have stopped counting individual cases, particularly of milder illness, the case count is likely to be significantly lower than the actual number of cases that have occurred. WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and through monitoring of multiple sources of data. \nSituation update: \n\nIn the temperate zone* of the northern hemisphere, the early arriving winter influenza season continues to intensify across central Europe and in parts of central, eastern, and southern Asia. Disease activity has peaked and is declining in North America and has either recently peaked or is currently peaking in much of western and northern Europe.\n\nIn both Canada and the United States, influenza virus circulation remains active and geographically widespread, however, disease activity appears to have peaked in past 3 to 4 weeks. In the United States, deaths due to pneumonia and influenza (P&I mortality) continued to increase past the epidemic threshold for the past 8 weeks and cumulative rates of hospitalizations for the current influenza season have exceeded rates seen in recent seasons among all age groups except those aged \u2265 65.\n\nIn Europe, widespread and intense transmission of pandemic influenza virus continued to be observed across most of the continent. In western and northern Europe the peak of disease activity has passed in Belgium, Iceland, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway and parts of the United Kingdom (Northern Ireland, Wales); activity may be peaking or plateauing in Spain, Portugal, Italy, Sweden and Denmark. Influenza activity continues to increase in much of Central Europe in the region between the Baltic and Balkan countries and from Germany to Romania. In Eastern Europe, recent peaks or plateaus in disease activity have also been observed in Ukraine, Belarus, Bulgaria and the Republic of Moldova. In the Russian Federation, influenza activity remains active and intense in some regions, with an overall increasing trend. A moderate impact on the healthcare system has been reported in parts of Northern and Eastern Europe. Over 99% of subtyped influenza A viruses in Europe were pandemic H1N1 2009.\n\nIn Western and Central Asia, influenza transmission remains active. Disease activity continues to increase in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Iran and Iraq, while activity may have peaked in Israel, Jordan, and Afghanistan.\n\nIn East Asia, increasing ILI** or respiratory disease activity has been reported in Southern China and Japan. A recent decline in activity has been observed in Northern China. In South and Southeast Asia, influenza activity continues to increase in the north-western parts of India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Cambodia, while activity in the rest of region remain low.\n\nIn the tropical zone of Central and South America and the Caribbean, influenza transmission remains geographically widespread but overall disease activity has been declining except for focal areas of increasing activity in Jamaica, Venezuela, and Ecuador. \n\nIn Africa, pandemic H1N1 2009 virus continues to be isolated from all parts of the continent, and there is evidence of continued co-circulation of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 and seasonal H3N2 viruses.\n\nIn the temperate region of the southern hemisphere, little pandemic influenza activity has been reported. \n\nThe Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN) continues monitoring the global circulation of influenza viruses, including pandemic, seasonal and other influenza viruses infecting, or with the potential to infect, humans including seasonal influenza.

        "Description of the Situation": "1 December 2009 -\nOn 14 November 2009, The Ministry of Health (MoH) in the Central African Republic reported four suspected cases of yellow fever, including 3 deaths. The cases were found through regular yellow fever surveillance in the Sub-Prefecture of Yalok\u00e9-Bossembelle, Prefecture of Ombella Mpoko and in the Sub-Prefecture of Bagamongone, Prefecture of La Lobaye.\n\nThe index case was reported in the Sub-Prefecture of Yalok\u00e9-Bossembelle. He was an 18-year-old man, a cattle breeder. On 6 September, he presented with fever, headache, jaundice and haemorrhagic signs. The patient was hospitalized in the health centre of Yaloke, where he died on 14 September. In the following days, 2 additional cases were reported with the same severe clinical presentation, and both died. In Bagamongone, a small town 20 km from Yaloke, another case was reported during the same period.\n\nThree cases were positive for yellow fever IgM at the National Laboratory in the Institute Pasteur of Bangui. The regional reference laboratory at Institut Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal, also confirmed that neutralization tests found specific antibodies against yellow fever, thus confirming the cases to be yellow fever. Other haemorrhagic fevers were excluded by specific tests. During the outbreak investigation conducted by the Ministry of Health, serum samples were collected from 80 of \"contacts\" of the cases. All these serum samples were sent to the Institute Pasteur of Bangui for investigation, and were IgM negative by ELISA test. Entomological studies showed a limited presence of mosquito vectors of sylvatic yellow fever. \n\nThese cases follow two yellow fever outbreaks in Basse Kotto and Ombella Mpoko Prefectures earlier in 2009. In 2008, 4 reported events resulted in reactive mass vaccination campaigns. Cases had occurred in the sub-prefectures of Bozoum in April 2008, Boda in August 2008, Bimbo and Briac in October 2008. An assessment of yellow fever virus circulation in human, non human primates and vectors was carried out in 2009 by a group of experts of the Yellow Fever Partnership. Laboratory testing for the study is underway.\n\nEmergency mass vaccination against yellow fever is planned for a population of 327,877 in affected regions for early December 2009. Vaccines have been provided from the global emergency vaccine stockpile, managed by the International Coordinating Group for Yellow Fever Vaccine Provision (YF-ICG) with funding from the GAVI Alliance. The Central African Republic is not part of a group of 12 endemic countries in Africa where preventive mass vaccination campaigns are ongoing since 2007. However, with these events since 2008, the Central African Republic is now considered to be at high risk of further outbreaks.",

WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and through monitoring of multiple sources of data. \nSituation update: \n\nThe situation remains similar since the last update. In temperate regions* of the northern hemisphere, the early arriving winter influenza season continues to intensify across parts of North America and much of Europe. However, there are early signs of a peak in disease activity in some areas of the northern hemisphere. \n\nIn the United States, influenza transmission remains active and geographically widespread, although disease activity appears to have recently peaked in most areas except in the northeastern United States. In Canada, influenza transmission continues to intensify without a clear peak in activity; the ILI consultation rate, which has been highest among children aged 5-19, continues to significantly exceed mean rates observed over the past 12 influenza seasons.\n\nIn Europe, widespread and increasing transmission of pandemic influenza virus was observed across much of the continent but the most intense circulation of virus occurred in northern, eastern, and southeastern Europe. Transmission appears to have peaked in few countries of Western Europe including Iceland, Ireland, the UK (Northern Ireland), and Belgium after a period of sustained intense transmission. Further east, a number of countries reported sharp increases in the rates of ILI** (Serbia, Moldova, Norway, Lithuania, Georgia) or ARI (Belarus, Bulgaria, Romania, and Ukraine). A moderate or greater impact on the healthcare system was reported in parts of northern and southeastern Europe. Greater than 20% of all sentinel respiratory specimens tested positive for influenza in at least 20 countries, with \u2265 50% of samples testing positive for influenza in Spain, Portugal, Estonia, Slovenia, Slovakia, Moldova, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Greece, Norway, Finland, Denmark, Belgium, Iceland, and Ireland. Over 99% of subtyped influenza A viruses in the Europe were pandemic H1N1 2009.\n\nIn Central and Western Asia, increasing diseases activity and pandemic influenza virus isolations continues to be reported in several countries. A high intensity of respiratory diseases with increasing trend was reported in Kazakhstan. Recent increases in rates of ILI or ARI have been observed in Uzbekistan and in parts of Afghanistan (particularly in the capital region and in southern and northeastern provinces). In Israel, sharp increases in rates of ILI and pandemic virus detections have been reported in recent weeks. \n\nIn East Asia, influenza transmission remains active. Intense influenza activity continues to be observed in Mongolia with a severe impact on the healthcare system; however, disease activity may have recently peaked in the past 1-2 weeks. In Japan, influenza activity remains elevated but stable nationally, and may be decreasing slightly in populated urban areas. A small number of seasonal H3N2 and H1N1 influenza viruses continue to be detected in China and South East Asia, though the proportion of seasonal viruses is declining in relation to the proportion of pandemic influenza H1N1.\n\nIn tropical zone of the Americas and Asia, the intensity of influenza transmission is variable. In the tropical areas of Central and South America, most countries continue to report declining influenza activity, with the exception of Peru and Colombia. In the Caribbean Epidemiology Centre (CAREC) countries, after a recent peak of disease activity, rates of ARI have declined over the past 3-4 weeks. With the exception of Sri Lanka, overall transmission continues to decline in most parts of tropical South and Southeast Asia. In Hong Kong SAR, rates of ILI have returned baseline after a recent wave of predominantly pandemic H1N1 influenza in September and October.\n\nIn the temperate region of the southern hemisphere, little pandemic influenza activity has been reported. \n\nFor more epidemiologic information please refer to the recent Weekly Epidemiological Report on Transmission Dynamics and Impact of Pandemic Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 Virus.\n\n\n13 November 2009, vol. 84, 46 (pp 477\u2013484)\n\n\n\nWHO estimates that around 80 million doses of pandemic vaccine have been distributed and around 65 million people have been vaccinated.

        "Description of the Situation": "Weekly update\n\n13 November 2009 -\nAs of 8 November 2009, worldwide more than 206 countries and overseas territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including over 6250 deaths. \n\nAs many countries have stopped counting individual cases, particularly of milder illness, the case count is likely to be significantly lower than the actual number of cases that have occurred. WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and through monitoring of multiple sources of data. \nSituation update: \n\nThe winter influenza season, which began unusually early across much of the Northern Hemisphere, shows early signs of peaking in parts of North America but is intensifying across much of Europe and Central and Eastern Asia. \n\nIn North America, Canada reported sharp increases in rates of influenza-like-illness (ILI), detections of pandemic H1N1 virus, and school outbreaks over the past three weeks as pandemic activity continues to spread west to east. In the United States, influenza transmission remains geographically widespread and intense but largely unchanged since the previous reporting week; rates of hospitalizations among persons aged 0-4 years, 5-17 years, and 18-49 years have now exceeded those seen during recent previous influenza seasons. Disease activity may have peaked in the earlier affected southern and south eastern parts of the United States. In Mexico, influenza activity remains geographically widespread with a significant wave of cases reported since early September, most notably from central and southern Mexico. \n\nIn Europe and Central Asia, overall influenza transmission continues to intensify throughout the continent as pandemic activity spreads eastward. At least 10 countries of Western Europe (Iceland, Poland, Romania, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom) now report that the proportion of sentinel samples testing positive for influenza exceeded 20% consistent with active circulation of pandemic influenza viruses. High to very high intensity of respiratory diseases with concurrent circulation of pandemic H1N1 2009 was also reported in the Netherlands, Italy, much of Northern Europe, Belarus, Bulgaria, and in the Russian Federation (particularly in the Urals). Disease activity may be peaking in a few countries, notably Iceland, Ireland, and parts of the UK (Northern Ireland) that experienced intense transmission during early autumn. Because of a sharp rise in pandemic influenza cases one week ago in Ukraine, the Ministry of Health requested assistance from WHO European Regional Office to evaluate and respond. The initial analysis of information indicates that the numbers of severe cases do not appear to be excessive when compared to the experience of other countries and do not represent any change in the transmission or virulence of the virus.\n\nOver 99% of subtyped influenza A viruses in the Europe were pandemic H1N1 2009 with the exception of the Russian Federation where <10% of viruses subtyped were seasonal influenza subtypes, H3N2 and seasonal H1N1.\n\nIn Western Asia, increasing activity has been observed in several countries. In Israel, sharp increases in rates of ILI and pandemic virus detections have been observed over the past 3 weeks. In Afghanistan, the proportion of sentinel visits for acute respiratory infections (ARI) has increased over the past 3-4 weeks, but more dramatically in the last 1-2 weeks.\n\nIn East Asia, very intense and increasing influenza activity continues to be reported in Mongolia with a severe impact on the healthcare system. In China, the proportion of sentinel hospital visits for ILI and the proportions of respiratory samples testing positive for influenza, continued to increase over the past 3-4 weeks. More than 80% of influenza viruses isolated in China were pandemic H1N1 2009. In Hong Kong SAR, rates of ILI have returned baseline after a recent wave of predominantly pandemic H1N1 influenza in September and October. In Japan, sharp increases in influenza activity continue to be reported nationally. On northern island of Hokkaido, which to date has been the most heavily affected, disease activity may have recently peaked.\n\n\nAlthough active, predominantly pandemic influenza transmission persists in the Caribbean region, disease activity may have recently peaked in some places as evidenced by recently declining rates of ARI and severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) in the Caribbean Epidemiology Centre (CAREC) countries. Most other countries in the tropical region of Central and South America continue to report declining influenza activity. \n\nWith the exception of Nepal and Sri Lanka, overall transmission continues to decline in most parts of South and Southeast Asia. \n\nIn the temperate region of the southern hemisphere, little pandemic influenza activity has been reported in recent weeks. Of note, a cluster of pandemic influenza cases been reported in Argentina in the capital area. \n\n\nWeekly update (Virological surveillance data)\n\n\n\n*Countries in temperate regions are defined as those north of the Tropic of Cancer or south of the Tropic of Capricorn, while countries in tropical regions are defined as those between these two latitudes. \nQualitative indicators (Week 29 to Week 44: 13 July - 1 November 2009)\n\nThe qualitative indicators monitor: the global geographic spread of influenza, trends in acute respiratory diseases, the intensity of respiratory disease activity, and the impact of the pandemic on health-care services. \n\n\nHuman infection with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus: updated interim WHO guidance on global surveillanceA description of WHO pandemic monitoring and surveillance objectives and methods can be found in the updated interim WHO guidance for the surveillance of human infection with pandemic (H1N1) virus.\n\n\n\nThe maps below display information on the qualitative indicators reported.

WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and through monitoring of multiple sources of data. \nSituation update: \n\nIntense and persistent influenza transmission continues to be reported in North America without evidence of a peak in activity. The proportion of sentinel physician visits due to influenza-like-illness (ILI)(8%) has exceeded levels seen over the past 6 influenza seasons; 42% of respiratory samples tested were positive for influenza and 100% of subtyped influenza A viruses were pandemic H1N1 2009. Rates of ILI, proportions of respiratory samples testing positive for influenza, and numbers of outbreaks in educational settings continues to increase sharply in Canada as activity spreads eastward. Significantly more cases of pandemic H1N1 have been recorded in Mexico since September than were observed during the initial springtime epidemic.\n\n\nIn Europe and Central and Western Asia, pandemic influenza activity continues to increase across many countries, signalling an unusually early start to the winter influenza season. Active circulation of virus marked by high proportions of sentinel respiratory samples testing positive for influenza has been reported in Belgium (69%), Ireland (55%), Netherlands (51%), Norway (66%), Spain (46%), Sweden (33%), the United Kingdom (Northern Ireland:81%), and Germany (27%). In addition, there is evidence of increasing and active transmission of pandemic influenza virus across Northern and Eastern Europe (including Ukraine and Belarus), and eastern Russia. For details on the situation in Ukraine please refer to the Disease Outbreak News update below. In Western Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean Region, increasing activity has been reported in Oman and Afghanistan. \n\n\nPandemic (H1N1) 2009, Ukraine - update 1\n\n\n\nIn East Asia, intense and increasing influenza activity continues to be reported in Mongolia. In China, after an earlier wave of mixed influenza activity (seasonal H3N2 and pandemic H1N1), pandemic H1N1 influenza activity now predominates and is increasing. Sharp increases in pandemic influenza activity continue to be reported throughout Japan with highest rates of illness being reported on the northern island.\n\nActive influenza transmission and increasing levels of respiratory diseases continues to be reported in parts of the Caribbean, including in Cuba, Haiti, and other Caribbean Epidemiology Centre (CAREC) countries. Most other countries in the tropical region of Central and South America continue to report declining influenza activity. With the exception of Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Cambodia, overall transmission continues to decline in most but not all parts of tropical South and Southeast Asia. Influenza virus isolates from sub-Saharan Africa are predominantly pandemic H1N1 virus but some seasonal H3N2 has been detected even in recent weeks. Unconfirmed media reports from the area indicate that disease activity has increased in recent weeks.\n\nSince the new pandemic H1N1 2009 virus emerged, infections in different species of susceptible animals (pig, turkey, ferret, and cat) have been reported. Limited evidence suggests that these infections occurred following direct transmission of the virus from infected humans. These isolated events have had no impact on the dynamics of the pandemic, which is spreading readily via human-to-human transmission. As human infections become increasingly widespread, transmission of the virus from humans to other animals is likely to occur with greater frequency. Unless the epidemiology of the pandemic changes, these will continue to pose no special risks to human health.\n\n\nWeekly update (Virological surveillance data)\n\n\n\n*Countries in temperate regions are defined as those north of the Tropic of Cancer or south of the Tropic of Capricorn, while countries in tropical regions are defined as those between these two latitudes. \nQualitative indicators (Week 29 to Week 43: 13 July - 25 October 2009)\n\nThe qualitative indicators monitor: the global geographic spread of influenza, trends in acute respiratory diseases, the intensity of respiratory disease activity, and the impact of the pandemic on health-care services. \n\n\nHuman infection with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus: updated interim WHO guidance on global surveillanceA description of WHO pandemic monitoring and surveillance objectives and methods can be found in the updated interim WHO guidance for the surveillance of human infection with pandemic (H1N1) virus.\n\n\n\nThe maps below display information on the qualitative indicators reported.

        "Description of the Situation": "3 November 2009 -\nAccording to the Ministry of Health of Ukraine, the country has now recorded more than 250 000 cases of influenza-like illness, with 235 patients requiring intensive care. As of 2 November, 70 deaths from acute respiratory illness have been reported.\n\nRegions in western Ukraine continue to show the highest rates of acute respiratory illness/influenza-like illness. The level of activity in the Kyiv area is also increasing rapidly. \n\n Laboratory testing in Ukraine has confirmed pandemic H1N1 influenza virus in samples taken from patients in two of the most affected regions. As the pandemic virus has rapidly become the dominant influenza strain worldwide, it can be assumed that most cases of influenza in Ukraine are caused by the H1N1 virus. \n\nAs elsewhere, WHO strongly recommends early treatment with the antiviral drugs, oseltamivir or zanamivir, for patients who meet treatment criteria, even in the absence of a positive laboratory test confirming H1N1 infection. \n\nAt the request of the government, a multi-disciplinary team of nine experts has been deployed by WHO and arrived in Kyiv yesterday evening. Discussions with the Minister of Health were held this morning to brief the team.\n\nTeam members will now begin field investigations to characterize the clinical and epidemiological features of the outbreak. Work will initially begin in Lviv region, where reported numbers of cases showing severe manifestations of acute respiratory illness have been especially high. Two virologists on the team have started working at the National Influenza Centre and the laboratories of the Central Sanitary and Epidemiological Station in Kyiv to provide diagnostic support.\n\nSamples sent by the Ministry of Health were received today by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza, Mill Hill in London, UK. The laboratory will conduct confirmatory tests and further characterize the virus.\n\nMany questions remain to be answered. The outbreak in Ukraine may be indicative of how the virus can behave in the northern hemisphere during the winter season, particularly in health care settings typically found in Eastern Europe.\n\nGiven the potential significance of this outbreak as an early warning signal, WHO commends the government of Ukraine for its transparent reporting and open sharing of samples.\n\nWHO continues to recommend no closing of borders and no restrictions on international travel, including to Ukraine. Experience shows that such measures will not stop further spread of the virus.",

        "Description of the Situation": "On 28 October 2009, the Ministry of Health of Ukraine informed WHO, through its Country Office in Ukraine, about an unusually high level of activity of acute respiratory illness in the western part of the country, associated with an increased number of hospital admissions and fatalities.\n\nOn 30 October 2009, the Ministry of Health of Ukraine announced the confirmation of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection by RT-PCR in eleven out of 30 samples obtained from patients presenting with acute respiratory illness in two of the most affected regions. Tests were performed in two laboratories in Kyiv, including the National Influenza Centre. Confirmatory tests will be performed at one of the WHO Collaborating Centres for Influenza.\n\nThe situation is quickly changing with increasingly high levels of acute respiratory illness (ARI)/Influenza-like-illness (ILI) activity being observed in Ternopil, Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk, and Chernivtsi regions. The higher levels of transmission in these regions corresponds to an increased number of hospital admissions and fatalities associated with severe manifestations of acute respiratory illness.\n\nAs of 30 October 2009, over 2,300 individuals have been admitted to hospital, including over 1,100 children. One hundred and thirty one (131) cases have required intensive care, including 32 children. As of 31 October 2009, a total of 38 fatalities associated with severe manifestations of ARI have been registered. Preliminary epidemiological data analysis indicates that severe cases and deaths primarily occur among previously healthy young adults aged 20 \u2013 50 years. Fatal and severe cases are reported to have sought medical attention 5 to 7 days after onset of symptoms.\n\nInternational experience of the (H1N1) 2009 pandemic to date, especially from the Southern Hemisphere, has shown that poor clinical outcomes are associated with delays in seeking health care and limited access to supportive care. In addition, this virus has also shown its ability to cause rapidly progressive overwhelming lung disease which is very difficult to treat.\n\nPublic health measures recommended by the Ministry of Health of Ukraine across the entire country include: social distancing (school closures and cancellation of mass gatherings); enhancement of surveillance activities; increased respiratory hygiene; and continuation of the vaccination campaign against seasonal influenza targeting at risk groups.\n\nThe Government of the Ukraine has activated coordination mechanisms to respond to the rapidly evolving situation, including the harmonization of response plans across all administrative levels. \n\nIn response to the request from the Minister of Health of Ukraine, WHO is deploying a multi-disciplinary team of experts to assist national authorities in mitigating the impact of the pandemic. The team comprises of the following expertise: health emergencies coordination, case management, epidemiology, laboratory diagnostics, logistics, and media/risk communications.\n\nAs per WHO's communication in May 2009, there is no rationale for travel restrictions because such measures will not prevent the spread of the disease. \n\nTravellers can protect themselves and others by following simple recommendations aimed at preventing the spread of infection such as attention to respiratory hygiene. Individuals who are ill should delay travel plans and returning travellers who fall ill should seek appropriate medical care. These recommendations are prudent measures which can limit the spread of many communicable diseases and not only the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus.",

In North America, the U.S.A. is still reporting nationwide rates of Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) well above baseline rates with high rates of pandemic H1N1 2009 virus detections in clinical laboratory specimens (29% of all specimens tested are positive for influenza A and all of those subtyped are pandemic H1N1 2009 virus. Canada reports increases in ILI rates for the fourth straight week but the highest level of activity is in the western province of British Columbia. Mexico still reports active transmission in some areas of the country. Although influenza activity is low in most countries in Europe, in Belgium, Israel, the Netherlands, Norway, and parts of the United Kingdom consultation ILI/ARI rates are above baseline levels. Similarly the number of influenza virus detections relatively high, which may indicate the early start of an influenza season. Rates of respiratory illness in Eastern Europe and Northern Asia are increasing but are not yet at levels normally seen in an influenza season (baseline levels are not defined in many countries of the area). Of note, the proportion of cases in Asia that are related to seasonal influenza A(H3N2) continue to decline globally as the proportion related to pandemic H1N1 2009 virus increases. Currently, only East Asia is reporting any significant numbers of influenza A(H3N2) isolates.\nIn tropical areas of the world, rates of illness are generally declining, with a few exceptions.

        "Description of the Situation": "Weekly update\n\nAs of 27 September 2009, worldwide there have been more than 340,000 laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009 and over 4100 deaths reported to WHO. \n\nAs many countries have stopped counting individual cases, particularly of milder illness, the case count is significantly lower than the actually number of cases that have occurred. WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and through monitoring of multiple sources of data. \nTransmission of influenza virus and rates of influenza-like-illness (ILI) continue to increase in the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. In North America, influenza transmission is geographically widespread and continues to increase. Levels of ILI have continued to increase and remain above the seasonal baseline for the past 4 weeks in most regions of the United States. In Mexico, a high intensity of respiratory diseases has been reported for two consecutive weeks (week 37 - 38), with large increases in cases being reported in the north and northwest of the country. In Europe and Central and Western Asia, although overall influenza activity remains low an increase in transmission has been noted in a number of countries and continues to intensify in others. Rates of influenza-like-illness continue to be above baseline levels in Ireland, parts of the United Kingdom (Northern Ireland), Israel, and France; in addition, more than 10 other countries in the region have reported geographically localized spread of influenza. In Japan, influenza activity has continued to increase above the seasonal epidemic threshold since week 33. These increases in ILI activity have been accompanied by increases in laboratory isolations of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009 in most of these areas.\nIn the tropical regions of the Americas and Asia, influenza transmission remains active but the trends in respiratory diseases activity are mixed. Although respiratory disease activity is geographically regional to widespread throughout the tropical region of the Americas, many countries have been recently reporting a declining trend (Bolivia, Brazil, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Panama, Paraguay, Venezuela), while others recently reported an increasing trend (Columbia and Cuba). In tropical regions of Asia, there continues to be an increasing trend in respiratory diseases in parts of India and in Cambodia, while other countries in the Southeast Asia have been recently reporting declining transmission. \nIn the temperate regions of the southern hemisphere, influenza transmission has largely returned to baseline (Chile, Argentina, and New Zealand) or has declined substantially (Australia and South Africa). \nAll pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza viruses analyzed to date have been antigenically and genetically similar to A/California/7/2009-like pandemic H1N1 2009 virus.

All of these viruses show the same H275Y mutation that confers resistance to the antiviral oseltamivir, but not to the antiviral zanamivir. No new resistant pandemic H1N1 influenza viruses have been officially reported to WHO during the past week.

        "Description of the Situation": "1 October 2009 -\nOn 8 September 2009, The Ministry of Health (MoH), Cameroon reported a laboratory-confirmed case of yellow fever, identified through routine yellow fever surveillance. The index case is from Kotto 1 - Bomboko village, Buea Health District, South-West Province. A reactive mass vaccination campaign is planned for October 2009 in two districts, Buea and Mbongue, with a target population of 165,138.\n\nThe patient is a 61 year-old man male, without history of yellow fever vaccination, who presented with fever, jaundice and back pain with onset of symptoms on 27 July 2009. The patient consulted a private practitioner in Buea Health District and a clinical diagnosis of yellow fever was made. \n\nPreliminary testing at the Institut Pasteur of Yaound\u00e9 suggested the patient may have yellow fever, a finding confirmed by the regional reference laboratory at the Institut Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal, where tests for other haemorrhagic fevers were negative. \n\nDuring the outbreak investigation, 51 serum samples were collected from additional suspected cases. Laboratory analysis of the specimens is ongoing at the Institut Pasteur in Yaound\u00e9.\nAs yellow fever outbreaks have occurred in different parts of Cameroon, the country carried out a national yellow fever preventive vaccination campaign in May 2009, for the population of 62 districts at high risk. The health district of Buea was not previously known to be a yellow fever endemic area. This outbreak response campaign will therefore extend the area protected against future outbreaks.\n\n\nThe country will use vaccine from the global yellow fever vaccine emergency stockpile, which is managed by the International Coordinating Group for Yellow Fever Vaccine Provision (YF-ICG) and funded by the GAVI Alliance.",

        "Description of the Situation": "Weekly update\n\nAs of 20 September 2009, there have been more than 300,000 laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1, 3917 deaths, in 191 countries and territories reported to WHO. \n\nAs more and more countries have stopped counting individual cases, particularly of milder illness, the case count is significantly lower than the actually number of cases that have occurred. While the case counts no longer reflect actual disease activity, WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and through monitoring of multiple sources of data. \nIn the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere, influenza-like-illness (ILI) activity continues to increase in many areas. In North America, the United States has reported continued increases in activity above the seasonal baseline for the last 2 to 3 weeks, primarily in the southeast but now also appearing in the upper midwest and the northeast. In Europe and Central and Western Asia, the United Kingdom is reporting regional increases in ILI activity in Northern Ireland and Scotland and the Netherlands, France, Ireland, and Israel are reporting rates above the seasonal baseline. In In Japan, influenza activity continues to be slightly above the seasonal epidemic threshold. The increases in ILI activity have been accompanied by increases in laboratory isolations of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009 in most of these areas.\nIn the tropical regions of the Americas and Asia, influenza activity remains variable. In parts of India, Bangladesh and Cambodia, influenza transmission continues to be active, while other countries in the Southeast Asia have been recently reporting declining transmission (Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand). Although most countries in the tropical regions of the Americas are still reporting regional to widespread geographic spread of influenza activity, there is no consistent pattern in the trend of respiratory diseases. Peru and Mexico have reported an increasing trend in some areas, while most others are reporting an unchanged or decreasing trend (most notably Bolivia, Venezuela and Brazil). \nIn the temperate regions of the southern hemisphere, influenza transmission has largely returned to baseline (Chile, Argentina, and New Zealand) or is continuing to decline (Australia and South Africa). \nAll pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza viruses analyzed to date have been antigenically and genetically similar to A/California/7/2009-like pandemic H1N1 2009 virus.

To date, 28 resistant viruses have been detected and characterized worldwide. All of these viruses show the same H275Y mutation that confers resistance to the antiviral oseltamivir, but not to the antiviral zanamivir. Twelve of these drug-resistant viruses were associated with the use of oseltamivir for post-exposure prophylaxis. Six were associated with the use of oseltamivir treatment in patients with severe imunosuppression. Four were isolated from samples from patients receiving oseltamivir treatment. A further two were isolated from patients who were not taking oseltamivir for either treatment or prophylaxis. Characterization of the remaining viruses is under way. Worldwide, more than 10,000 clinical specimens (samples and isolates) of the pandemic H1N1 virus have been tested and found to be sensitive to oseltamivir.\nWHO has just concluded its Vaccine Composition Meeting for the Southern Hemisphere (held in Melbourne, Australia) and has made recommendations for the composition of the influenza virus vaccine for use in the 2010 southern hemisphere influenza season. WHO recommends that influenza virus vaccines for use in the 2010 influenza season (southern hemisphere winter) contain the following strains: A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)-like virus; A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2)-like virus; and B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus.

In temperate areas of the northern hemisphere (represented by North America, Europe, and Central Asia), influenza and respiratory disease activity remains low overall, with some countries experiencing localized outbreaks. In Japan, the level of influenza activity has passed the seasonal epidemic threshold, signaling a very early beginning to the annual influenza season. \nPandemic H1N1 influenza virus continues to be the predominant circulating strain of influenza, both in the northern and southern hemisphere.

As more and more countries have stopped counting individual cases, particularly of milder illness, the case number is significantly lower than the actually number of cases that have occurred. However, through the WHO monitoring network, it is apparent that rates of influenza illness continue to decline in the temperate regions of the southern hemisphere, except in South Africa where pandemic influenza H1N1 appeared slightly later than the other countries of the region. Active transmission is still seen in some later affected areas of Australia, Chile and Argentina even as national rates decrease. \nAreas of tropical Asia are reporting increasing rates of illness as they enter their monsoon season, as represented by India, Thailand, Malaysia, and Hong Kong, four places in the region which have active surveillance programs. Tropical regions of Central America, represented by Costa Rica and El Salvador, are also seeing very active transmission.\nIn the northern temperate zones, overall rates are declining in both North America and Europe though the virus is still found across a wide area throughout both regions and pockets of high activity are being reported in 3 U.S. states and a few countries of Western Europe.\nIt has been noted throughout the temperate zones of the southern hemisphere, which are now passing out of their winter season, that when pandemic H1N1 began to circulate, the relative importance of seasonal strains, represented by H3N2 in nearly all countries, rapidly diminished and pandemic H1N1 became the dominant strain. Some seasonal H1N1 strains were reported but were even less common than seasonal H3N2. It is too early to tell if this co-circulation of multiple strains will continue into the coming season of the Northern Hemisphere but it appears very likely that pandemic H1N1 will be the dominant influenza virus in the early part of the winter months.\nMany countries including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the U.S. have noted that their indigenous peoples appear to be at increased risk of severe disease related to pandemic influenza. While it still has not been clearly determined how much of the increased risk observed in these groups is due to issues related to access to care, high rates of chronic medical conditions that are known to increase risk, or other factors, countries with indigenous and other vulnerable populations should carefully evaluate the situation and consider ways to mitigate the impact of the pandemic in the coming season in these populations.\nWHO has also been notified of 12 cases of oseltamivir resistant virus. These isolates have a mutation in the neuraminidase (referred to as H275Y) that confers resistance to oseltamivir, though the viruses remain sensitive to zanamivir. Of these 8 have been associated with oseltamivir post exposure prophylaxis, one with treatment of uncomplicated illness, and two have been from immunocompromised patients receiving oseltamivir treatment. These isolated cases have arisen in different parts of the world (Japan 4, USA 2, China, Hong Kong SAR China 2, and 1 in Denmark, Canada, Singapore and China), and there are no epidemiological links between them. There is also no evidence of onward transmission from these cases.\n\nVirology data update as of 8 August 2009\n\nDownload update (.pdf)",

While the case counts no longer reflect actual disease activity, WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states.  Of particular interest is the situation in temperate countries of the Southern Hemisphere, which are now passing through their winter season. This season, pandemic H1N1 has been the predominant influenza virus in nearly all of the temperate regions of Southern Hemisphere, with South Africa being a notable exception. Australia and countries in the southern part of South America experienced rapid increases in cases of pandemic influenza early in their winter season. These same areas are now starting to report decreases in the numbers of people seeking care and being admitted to hospital. Although the virus is still circulating in these areas as it moves into areas not affected earlier, the overall national trends are downward. South Africa, in contrast, experienced an early influenza season with a seasonal subtype, influenza A (H3N2). As the influenza season in South Africa reached its peak in early to mid June and began to decline, pandemic influenza H1N1 appeared and has now become the dominant subtype seen there as well.\n In the temperate areas of the northern hemisphere which experienced early outbreaks of pandemic H1N1 influenza, including countries in North America and Europe, the virus continues to spread to new areas and cause intense local outbreaks. However, the overall national trend in cases is downward in the Americas.  Tropical regions of the world, which typically experience year round transmission of influenza viruses with peak transmission at different and often multiple times in a year, are now seeing increases in cases, for example in tropical areas of Central and South America and in South and South East Asia.  In summary, the overall picture of transmission globally is one of declining transmission in the temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere with the exception of southern Africa. The season in these areas was characterized by rapid rise and fall of respiratory disease numbers, as is seen in a normal influenza season. The impact and severity of the season in these areas in terms of proportion of cases which developed severe disease and the load imposed on health care infrastructure is still being evaluated but generally appeared slightly worse than a normal influenza season in most places with increased hospitalization requiring respiratory critical care. The northern hemisphere is experiencing continued spread of the virus but declining activity is being observed in areas affected early in the course of the pandemic. Tropical areas of the world are now experiencing increasing numbers of cases at a time when the usual seasonal peaks would occur. As the pandemic H1N1 influenza virus is now the dominant strain in most areas of the world, it can be expected to persist into the coming influenza season in the Northern Hemisphere. Additionally, there is a risk of further spread of virus in highly populated areas as community spread starts occurring in Asia and Africa.",

        "Description of the Situation": "17 July 2009 -\nIn 2009, the northern states of Nigeria have experienced a large polio outbreak due to wild poliovirus type 3 (WPV3) with 258 cases, compared to 32 cases for the same period in 2008. WPV3 from northern Nigeria has this year spread internationally to Niger. Since February 2009, there has also been an increasing number of polio cases due to a type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) in northern Nigeria (103 cases to date in 2009 compared to 31 cases for the same period in 2008). Both serotypes are at continued, and in the case of the cVDPV2 increasing, risk of international spread. While the number of cVDPV2 cases is lower than WPV3 cases, circulation of this serotype is of particular international concern as the last case of polio due to a circulating wild poliovirus type 2 (WPV2) was in 1999. \n\nIn response to these risks, Nigeria has conducted nationwide polio supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) with monovalent OPV type 3 (mOPV3) in late January 2009 and with trivalent OPV from 30 May to 2 June. Additional SIAs are planned for later in the year, including an SIA with trivalent OPV for August.\n\nTo minimize the risk and consequences of international spread of these polioviruses, countries across west and central Africa, particularly those bordering the affected states of northern Nigeria, should enhance surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), identify subnational population immunity gaps, and strengthen routine immunization with trivalent OPV. Countries affected by poliovirus importations should continue to supplement routine immunization with large-scale outbreak response activities with the relevant OPV, as per the WHA Resolution WHA59.1.\n\n\nFor more information\n\n\nGlobal Polio Eradication Initiative",

Fifty-five out of 62 districts in all 10 provinces have been affected. \n\nThe number of cases reported per week has decreased from over 8 000 cases per week at the beginning of February 2009 to about 100 cases per week at the end of May 2009. The weekly Case Fatality Rate has also decreased from its peak of near 6% in January 2009, to 1.5% for the week ending 30 May 2009. In the week ending 30 May 2009, 68 new suspected cases and one death were reported, compared to 140 cases and two deaths during the earlier week. \n\nThe cholera epidemic appears to be coming to an end but efforts still need to be maintained, especially in the few districts that continue to report cholera cases. The epidemiological situation should be monitored closely and control measures already put in place should be sustained. \n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) and its Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) partners have been working with the Ministry of Health of the Government of Zimbabwe with cholera control efforts across the country. WHO and GOARN partners include the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh; Burnet Institute in Australia; the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Health Protection Agency in the UK; US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; and the National Board of Health and Welfare, Sweden. Non-governmental organizations such as M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res, the Red Cross and others have been key in supporting MoHCW in treating patients across the country at a time when many health facilities were not fully functional.",

        "Description of the Situation": "24 April 2009 -\nThe United States Government has reported seven confirmed human cases of Swine Influenza A/H1N1 in the USA (five in California and two in Texas) and nine suspect cases. All seven confirmed cases had mild Influenza-Like Illness (ILI), with only one requiring brief hospitalization. No deaths have been reported. \n\nThe Government of Mexico has reported three separate events. In the Federal District of Mexico, surveillance began picking up cases of ILI starting 18 March. The number of cases has risen steadily through April and as of 23 April there are now more than 854 cases of pneumonia from the capital. Of those, 59 have died. In San Luis Potosi, in central Mexico, 24 cases of ILI, with three deaths, have been reported. And from Mexicali, near the border with the United States, four cases of ILI, with no deaths, have been reported.\n\nOf the Mexican cases, 18 have been laboratory confirmed in Canada as Swine Influenza A/H1N1, while 12 of those are genetically identical to the Swine Influenza A/H1N1 viruses from California.\n\nThe majority of these cases have occurred in otherwise healthy young adults. Influenza normally affects the very young and the very old, but these age groups have not been heavily affected in Mexico. \n\nBecause there are human cases associated with an animal influenza virus, and because of the geographical spread of multiple community outbreaks, plus the somewhat unusual age groups affected, these events are of high concern.\n\nThe Swine Influenza A/H1N1 viruses characterized in this outbreak have not been previously detected in pigs or humans. The viruses so far characterized have been sensitive to oseltamivir, but resistant to both amantadine and rimantadine.\n\nThe World Health Organization has been in constant contact with the health authorities in the United States, Mexico and Canada in order to better understand the risk which these ILI events pose. WHO (and PAHO) is sending missions of experts to Mexico to work with health authorities there. It is helping its Member States to increase field epidemiology activities, laboratory diagnosis and clinical management. Moreover, WHO's partners in the Global Alert and Response Network have been alerted and are ready to assist as requested by the Member States.\n\nWHO acknowledges the United States and Mexico for their proactive reporting and their collaboration with WHO and will continue to work with Member States to further characterize the outbreak.",

        "Description of the Situation": "31 March 2009 -\nOn 16 February 2009, the Government of Philippines announced that a slaughterhouse worker who has daily contact with pigs tested positive for antibodies against the Ebola Reston virus. \n\nThis brings to six, out of a total of 141 people, who have tested positive for Ebola Reston antibodies in the Philippines since testing began in December 2008. All six people who were antibody positive reported occupational exposure to pigs. \n\nThe Philippine Department of Health has said that all six people who tested positive appear to be in good health. Pig-to-human transmission is believed to be the most likely source of infection. \n\nTo date, since the first human to develop antibodies against Ebola Reston was reported in 1989, no significant human illness has been reported in association with Ebola Reston infection. However only a very small number of humans with Ebola Reston antibodies have ever been detected, and all were healthy adult males. The threat to human health is likely to be low for healthy adults but is unknown for all other population groups, such as immuno-compromised persons, persons with underlying medical conditions, pregnant women and children. More studies are needed to better understand the public health implications of Ebola Reston in humans and efforts should be made to reduce the risk of human infection.\n\nEbola Reston virus species belongs to the Ebola genus in the Filovirus family, a genus that comprises other Ebola species that are known to be highly pathogenic for humans. All members of the Filovirus family are only handled in laboratories with the highest level of biosecurity. \n\nRecent cases in the Philippines mark the first time that Ebola Reston has been found in pigs, and the first time that suspected transmission from pigs to humans has occurred.",

        "Description of the Situation": "2 March 2009 -\nThe recent expansion of a prolonged outbreak of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) in Sudan poses a very high risk of further international spread, requiring urgent and immediate outbreak response activities in the affected areas and heightened surveillance in countries at risk. Previously restricted to southern Sudan and western Ethiopia, the outbreak has now spread to Kenya, Uganda and northern Sudan (in Khartoum and Port Sudan).\n\n\nOf particular concern is the confirmation of the WPV1 in Port Sudan. It is from this area that, from 2004 to 2006, WPV1 spread to re-infect several countries, including Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Yemen and Indonesia, causing outbreaks that resulted in more than 1,200 cases and over US$150 million in international emergency outbreak response costs. Due to the historical international spread of polioviruses from Port Sudan, the new international spread from southern Sudan to Kenya and Uganda, and the suboptimal quality of outbreak response activities in southern Sudan and western Ethiopia (monitoring data indicates that upwards of 30% of children remain un- or under-immunized with \u22643 doses of oral poliovirus vaccine), WHO assesses the risk of further international spread from the Sudan as very high. \n\nStopping this outbreak requires the full implementation of the international polio outbreak response standards, adopted by the World Health Assembly in May 2006, until transmission has been confirmed to be interrupted.\n\nIn northern Sudan, a large-scale supplementary immunization activity (SIA) began on 15 February with additional campaigns planned for 23 March and again in late-April. In southern Sudan, SIAs were held on 13 January and 23 February, with further activities planned for 23 March and late April, following which the onset of the rainy season in May could complicate the logistics of reaching all populations in this already difficult-to-access terrain. Consequently, particular attention is being given to closing the persistent OPV coverage gaps during the upcoming SIAs. \n\nIn coordination with the polio campaigns in the Sudan, plans for rapid outbreak response campaigns are being finalized for late March, late April and possibly again in late May in the affected areas of Kenya and Uganda. Genetic sequencing data suggests that the importations into these countries have been rapidly detected, improving the prospects for interrupting transmission in the near term if the campaigns are of sufficiently high quality to reach >90% of children in the affected areas.\n\nIt is important that countries across central Africa, the Horn of Africa and the Gulf strengthen surveillance for cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), in order to rapidly detect any new poliovirus importations and facilitate a rapid response. Countries should also analyze routine immunization coverage data to identify any subnational gaps in population immunity to guide catch-up immunization activities and thereby minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction. Priority should be given to areas at high-risk of importations and where OPV3/DPT3 coverage is <80%.",

All 10 provinces are affected. The numbers of cases and deaths reported last week indicate a decrease from the previous week however, this data should be interpreted with caution as the figures are revised as new information becomes available. \n\nThe weekly CFR has been decreasing regularly since early January, but was still 3.1% last week, far above the expected level of 1%. About half the deaths continue to be recorded within the community rather than health facilities. \n\nSome 365 Cholera Treatment Centres (CTCs) and Units (CTUs) are reported to be active in all provinces and the CFR reported by these centres has been reduced from 4% in late December to between 1% and 2% over the last 3 weeks. \n\nHigh numbers of cases are also reported in neighbouring countries, especially South Africa, where the relative strength of the health care system has enabled the CFR to remain below 1%. Other countries where cholera has been reported include Malawi, Mozambique and Zambia, but it must be noted that cholera is endemic in these countries. \n\nA Cholera Command and Control Centre has been set up in the capital, Harare, by WHO, together with MoHCW, and health and water and sanitation partners. The role of the Centre is to provide technical coordination for partners in the areas of epidemiological and laboratory surveillance, case management, social mobilization, logistics and infection control/water and sanitation in treatment centres. An alert and response system has been established with partners and the MoHCW to provide daily reporting of cases and deaths. The system can also provide immediate alerts of new outbreaks. Training sessions on all aspects of cholera control are being organized for partners and MoHCW staff at central and provincial levels.\n\nWHO experts in public health, water and sanitation, logistics and social mobilization have been deployed to outbreak areas from the Country Office in Harare, the Inter-Country Support Team in the sub-region, the African Regional Office and WHO Headquarters. Institutions from the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (Burnet Institute in Australia; the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Health Protection Agency in the UK; the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh; US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; and the National Board of Health and Welfare, Sweden) have deployed experts to Zimbabwe to support WHO response efforts. WHO is supplying Diarrheal Disease kits, Emergency Health kits and other medicines.\n\nGiven the outbreak's dynamic, in the context of a dilapidated water and sanitation infrastructure and a weak health system, the practical implementation of control measures remains a challenge. Priorities now include decentralizing response activities to the periphery, particularly to areas with no active nongovernmental organizations, and strengthening social mobilization in communities to improve access to health services and earlier treatment. Activities will also focus on resource mobilization and greater involvement of partners in the field.",

        "Description of the Situation": "3 February 2009 -\nOn 23 January 2009, the Government of the Philippines announced that a person thought to have come in contact with sick pigs had tested positive for Ebola Reston Virus (ERV) antibodies (IgG). On 30 January 2009 the Government announced that a further four individuals had been found positive for ERV antibodies: two farm workers in Bulacan and one farm worker in Pangasinan - the two farms currently under quarantine in northern Luzon because of ERV infection was found in pigs - and one butcher from a slaughterhouse in Pangasinan. The person announced on 23 January to have tested positive for ERV antibodies is reported to be a backyard pig farmer from Valenzuela City - a neighbourhood within Metro Manila.\n\nThe Philippine Department of Health has said that the people who tested positive appear to be in good health and have not suffered from any significant illnesses in the past 12 months. The investigation team reported that it was possible that all 5 individuals had been exposed to the virus as a result of direct contact with sick pigs. The use of personal protective equipment (PPE) is not common practice among these animal handlers. \n\nFrom these observations and previous studies of ERV, the virus has shown it can be transmitted to humans, without resulting in illness. However, the evidence available relates only to healthy adults and it would be premature to conclude the health effects of the virus on all population groups. The threat to human health is likely to be low for healthy adults but is unknown for all other population groups, such as immuno-compromised persons, persons with underlying medical conditions, pregnant women and children. \n\nThe Philippine Government is conducting contact tracing in relation to the five individuals who tested positive for antibodies. In addition, testing is ongoing for other persons who could have come into contact with sick pigs on the two quarantined farms in the provinces of Bulacan and Pangasinan where pigs co-infected with the Porcine Respiratory and Reproductive Syndrome (PRRS) and ERV were reported in 2008. The two farms remain under quarantine and the Philippine Government is maintaining its voluntary hold of exports of live pigs and fresh and frozen pork meat.\n\nThe Philippine Government has announced a combined Department of Health and Department of Agriculture strategy to limit the animal and human health risks of the Ebola Reston Virus and emphasized that local governments, the pig farming industry and the public will play a critical role in the strategy. \n\nAlong with its international partners, the WHO will continue to support the Philippine Government in its efforts to gain a better understanding of the Ebola Reston virus, its effects on humans, and the measures that need to be taken to reduce any risks to human health.",

        "Description of the Situation": "6 January 2009 -\nFrom 2003 to 2007, type 1 polio originating in northern Nigeria spread to cause outbreaks in 20 previously polio-free countries, including across west Africa, the Horn of Africa, and as far away as Indonesia and Yemen. The outbreaks in these 20 countries resulted in 1,517 cases, and cost upwards of 500 million US Dollars in international emergency outbreak response funds.\n\nIn 2008, northern Nigeria is experiencing an outbreak of wild poliovirus type 1, which has spread internationally into nearby countries in west Africa. Since April 2008, cases due to type 1 polio genetically linked to viruses from northern Nigeria have been detected in Benin, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Niger, Mali and Togo. In 2008, Nigeria accounts for 80% of type 1 polio cases in the world. In addition to international spread of type 1 polio, wild poliovirus type 3 originating from northern Nigeria has also been reported in Chad and Niger. \n\nThe risk of additional importations into these west African countries depends fully on the quality of outbreak response activities in Nigeria and the re-infected countries themselves. \n\nIn the second half of 2008, Nigeria has conducted large-scale rounds of emergency polio immunization campaigns in the northern states in July and August, as well as in November when oral polio vaccine (OPV) was added to an integrated measles vaccination campaign. Additional nationwide campaigns are planned for late January and again in February. \n\nTo minimize the risk of onward spread of polio from Ghana, in particular into C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Ghana has conducted large-scale polio immunization campaigns in October, November and December. The feasibility of conducting preventive campaigns in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire is currently being explored. Elsewhere in west Africa, large-scale polio immunization campaigns have been carried out and/or are being planned in Benin, Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger and Togo. \n\nGiven these risks, it is important that countries across west Africa strengthen disease surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), in order to rapidly detect any poliovirus importations and facilitate a rapid response. Countries should also continue to boost routine immunization coverage against polio to minimize the consequences of any introduction.\n\nFor more information\n\n\nGlobal Polio Eradication Initiative",
