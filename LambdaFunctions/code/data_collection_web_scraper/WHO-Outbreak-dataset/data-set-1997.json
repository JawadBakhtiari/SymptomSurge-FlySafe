        "Description of the Situation": "Disease Outbreak ReportedThe WHO team investigating the extended outbreak of human monkeypox continued its\nmission in Kasai Oriental, Democratic Republic of the Congo in October 1997. It included\nrepresentatives of the national government, Centres for Disease Control and Prevention,\nAtlanta, Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre, London, Epicentre, Paris and European\nProgramme for Intervention Epidemiology Training, Brussels and WHO geneva and\nKinshasa.The team identified 419 suspect cases fitting the case definition of a possible or probable\ncase, which, together with those identified in previous surveys, amounts to a total of 511\nsuspect cases of human monkeypox reported since February 1997. The highest number of\nsuspect cases were in outbreaks in Akungula in August 1997, in Ekanga and neighbouring\nvillages in March 1997 and several other villages in August 1997.Of the 419 suspect cases identified by the team in October 1997, 344 occurred in the Katako\nKombe health zone and 75 in the Lodja health zone. Fourteen of them had active disease. Most (85%) of the 344 suspect cases resident in the Katako-Kombe zone were in children\nunder 16 years of age. Thirty-one per cent had had moderate or severe rash, i.e. more than\n100 skin lesions, and in 41% the eruption lasted longer than one week. Fever, diarrhoea,\ncervical lympadenopathy, sore throat and mouth ulcers were the most common symptoms. Ten were hospitalised for up to 30 days and 54% were incapacitated for more than three days.\nFive died (case fatality ratio 1.5%). These individuals ranged in age from four to eight years\nand all died within three weeks of rash onset. Twenty had scar evidence of vaccinia\nvaccination and 19 reported a past history of chicken pox.Twenty-two per cent of the 419 suspect cases identified during this mission were primary, the\nremainder were defined as secondary. Of these secondary cases, 48% reported contact with\nanother suspect case in the compound, 42% in the household and 53% in the neighbourhood\n(some had more than one contact). Primary cases with no apparent connection to Akungula\nand Ekanga villages, were reported from 49 of the total 78 villages where cases were found.\nThirty-five per cent of the 419 cases reported being outside their home village in the three\nweeks before disease onset - the majority in the forest.This outbreak represents the largest ever reported cluster of suspect cases spread over a large\narea of the Katako-Kombe and Lodja zones. The clinical disease was milder but household\nsecondary attack rate was higher than previously documented, possibly due to an increased\nnumber of susceptible individuals after the cessation of vaccinia vaccination, rather than\nincreased person to person transmission. Some of the serum specimens obtained from suspect\ncases have been positive for varicella, and final analysis will take this into account.Transmission seems to have now ceased at the original epicentre of the outbreak and the\nimmediate surrounding villages. The more recently detected suspect human cases occurred in\nmore geographically distant clusters, the majority with no apparent link to the original\noutbreak. These suspect cases of sporadic transmission may be due to independent\nintroductions of virus into the human population through increased animal contact.Results of the final analysis will be published simultaneously when laboratory results are\navailable in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, the EuroSurveillance Bulletin and the\nWeekly Epidemiological Record.",

        "Description of the Situation": "31 October 1997 Disease Outbreak Reported\n\n\n\nFrom a press release issued jointly by Ministry of Health and the WHO Representative in\nGhana:\n\nOn 25 September 1997, the Ministry of Health, Ghana was contacted by the Ghanaian\nEmbassy in Bonn, Germany regarding a man who allegedly died of Lassa fever at Mainz\nmain hospital. The deceased was identified by the hospital authorities as a 37-year male who\nhad apparently arrived in Germany on a Ghana Airways flight.\n\nThe Ministry of Health, Ghana assured the Ghanaian Embassy that no case of Lassa fever had\nbeen reported in Ghana and thus the patient could not have been infected in Ghana. The\nMinistry of Health recommended that the origin of the patient be verified since his name did\nnot sound Ghanaian nor did his supposed arrival via Ghana Airways mean that he had\nrecently stayed in Ghana.\n\nOn 26 September the Mainz hospital authorities called a press conference and announced that\ntests conducted at the Tropical Disease Institute at the Bernhard Nocht Institute, Hamburg had dismissed Lassa fever as the cause of death of the man.\n\nThe press release was issued to assure Ghanaians and all visitors to Ghana that Lassa fever\nhas never been detected in Ghana. Ever since the detection of the cases of Lassa fever in\nNigeria, Ghanaian clinicians have been particular about examining cases of fever with\nhaemorrhagic tendencies thoroughly. In addition the Noguchi Memorial Institute for\nMedical Research at the University of Ghana has often been called upon to support the\nnational laboratory network in this work. \n\nThe Ministry of Health is confident that their disease surveillance system is very active and\nshould a case of Lassa fever or any other unusual disease appear in the country it will be\ndetected and contained.",

Facing the possibility of further spread of HPS, the\nministers of health of all countries in the Americas joined in a resolution to intensify the\nsurveillance of, and fight against, hantavirus infection during the Directing Council of the Pan\nAmerican Health Organization (PAHO) in September 1997.\n\nA total of 350-400 HPS cases have been confirmed in the Americas, most of them in\nArgentina and the USA. About 45% of the reported cases were fatal. The high fatality rate is\nassociated with the sudden onset of pulmonary oedema and respiratory distress. There is no\nspecific treatment for HPS, although prompt diagnosis is important for appropriate\nmanagement of respiratory distress. \n\nHPS is caused by several distinct hantaviruses which are each associated with a specific\nrodent host. Once infected, rodents shed the virus throughout their lifetime. Humans are\ninfected by inhaling aerosols of fresh or dried rodent excreta (faeces, urine and saliva).\nInvestigation of an epidemic in Argentina in 1995 provided strong evidence for\nperson-to-person transmission, not observed in studies in the USA. In any event, strict barrier\nnursing techniques are now recommended for management of suspected or confirmed cases.\n\nControl measures in endemic areas focus on rodent control with particular emphasis on\nexcluding rodents from buildings and reducing suitable habitats around inhabited dwellings. Many infections have resulted from cleaning rodent-infested areas. The use of readily\navailable disinfectants such as chlorine bleach is recommended to decontaminate potentially\ninfectious droppings and debris prior to cleaning. If available, respiratory protection should\nbe used during this high risk activity.\n\nImproved laboratory diagnostic capacity in endemic areas is important for prompt recognition\nof HPS cases. Furthermore, identification of the rodent reservoir of each hantavirus is\nimportant to detect potential HPS endemic regions and to understand the risk of\nrodent-human interaction.\n\n(For further information on HPS see web pages at PAHO - http://www.paho.org/english/DPI/rl970925.htm and the US Center for Disease Control and\nPrevention at http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/hanta/hantvrus.htm )",

A weekly average of about 5 cases were reported up to\nthe second week of July when the number of cases started to increase. In the third week of\nAugust, 51 cases were reported. Twenty-four of the 223 cases reported since the second\nweek of April were fatal. The cases were from 20 of the 75 districts of the country as\nfollows:- Bankey district (with the highest number of cases), Bardiya. Jhapa, Chitwan,\nRupandehi, Kailali, Nawalparasi. Morang, Surkhet, Dang, Kanchanpur, Makwanpur, Gorkha,\nSaptari, Tanahu, Mahotari, Sindhuli, Siraha, Sunsari and Dhanusha. Three cases were in\npersons from neighbouring states in India.\n\nAge and sex information available for 139 of the 247 cases reported shows 62% among\nmales and 38% among females. Four cases (3%) were under one year of age, 24 (17%) in\nthe age group 1-4 years; 57 cases (41%) in the age group 5-14 years, 42 (30%) in the age\ngroup 15-44 years, 9 (6%) in the age group 45-60 years and 3 (2%) in the age group 60 years\nor more. Ninety-four (68%) of these 139 cases were reported during the weeks of increased\nactivity.\n\nCases of encephalitis in Nepal are reported throughout the year and usually increase between\nJune and October. The diagnosis is made on a clinical basis as there are no laboratory means\nto establish etiology. However, studies conducted in the country indicate that many of the\ncases are due to Japanese encephalitis (JE). The cases were reported by eight sentinel\nhospitals to the Vector Borne Disease Research and Training Center (VBDRTC) in Hetauda,\nMakwanpur which acts as focal point for EWARS. \n\n(Based on EWARS Weekly Bulletin; Epidemiological Week No. 33; Epidemiology and\nDisease Control Division, Vol. I, No. 19, 15-22 August 1997 via the Office of the WHO\nRepresentative in Nepal.

The diagnosis was made on the basis of the\ndetection of IgM antibody to yellow fever virus. The samples were first tested at the Institut\nPasteur in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire and then referred to the WHO Collaborating Centre for\nArboviruses and other Haemorrhagic Fevers, Institut Pasteur, Paris on 6 August.\n\nComment: The large scale immunization campaign conducted in early 1997, following the\noutbreak which started in July 1995, reached nearly 80% of the 1.3 million people targeted\nfor immunization. However, it could not then be extended to Lofa County due to the war. The present immunization campaign is expected to reach the many refugees that are presently\nbeing repatriated from Guinea. This year's campaign may be difficult as it will be conducted\nduring the rainy season and the bridges leading into the County have been destroyed.

Five strains of dengue type 1\nand two strains of dengue type 2 were isolated from severe dengue cases. Dengue type 1 was\nthe predominant strain in 1987 and 1988, dengue type 2 in the years 1989, 1990 and 1991\nand dengue type 3 from 1992 to 1995. In 1997, both dengue type 1 and 2 viruses were active.\n\nOne case of vertical transmission has been confirmed this season. Last year, there were two\nsuch cases which resulted in the death of an infant who developed respiratory distress and a\nlarge uncontrollable left intracerebral bleed. The child expired at day 6 of life from\nmultiorgan failure.

On examination, he showed poor\nperipheral perfusion and tachycardia, subsequently developed cardiac failure, and died on 15\nApril 1997. Since then, 26 more children in several cities in Sarawak have died of heart\nfailure, and 2 others who were brought in dead are suspected to have died of similar cause. Eighteen (62%) of the 29 children were male. Their mean age was 1.6 years (range 7 months\nto 6 years); 23 (79.3%) of 29 were less than 2 years old.\n\nThe 27 children who were admitted alive presented with or soon thereafter developed signs of\nshock, including pallor, cold extremities, delayed capillary refill, and weak peripheral pulses. Pulmonary oedema was present in many cases; intravenous fluids often exacerbated the\noedema. Nearly all the children had sinus tachycardia on electrocardiogram; no rhythm\ndisturbances were noted. Echocardiograms obtained on most patients uniformly showed a\npoorly contractile globular left ventricle with low output (ejection fraction <60%). In most\ninstances, children died within 7 days of onset of illness, and death usually ensued within 24\nhours of admission. Postmortem examinations have been performed on 3 children; results are\npending. The most recent fatal case to date had onset on 21 June 1997 and died on 24 June\n1997.\n\nMany of these children had a maculopapular or vesicular rash on the palms or soles and\nvesicles or ulcers in the oral cavity, characteristic of hand, foot, and mouth disease. Several\nchildren had signs of central nervous system infection [3 (15%) of 20 had acute flaccid\nparalysis, and 9 (45%) of 20 had histories of seizures]. Examination of the cerebrospinal\nfluid showed a lymphocytosis, consistent with viral meningitis. In several cases, family\nmembers reported that the children who died had been in contact with other children with\nhand, foot, and mouth disease two to five days prior to onset of their own illness.\n\nSince April 1997, private practitioners in Sarawak have reported seeing a large number of\nchildren with hand, foot and mouth disease, who presented with fever, mouth ulcers and\nmaculopapular or vesicular rash on the palms and soles. Since 6 June 1997, private\nphysicians and government clinics have reported 2 113 cases of hand, foot, and mouth disease\nin young children in Sarawak (population 1.9 million).\n\nDuring June 1997, almost 2140 children with hand, foot and mouth disease have been\nadmitted to private or government hospitals in peninsular Malaysia (population 21 million). No fatalities have yet ben reported among those children hospitalized.\n\nUpdate 30 June: The Sarawak Health Department informed of an additional fatal case in a\n2-year-old boy from Sarikei Division who died from viral myocarditis in Sarawak General\nHospital on 30 June. Update posted on the web site of Sarawak Health Department at\nhttp://www.jaring.my/jkns/outbreak/virus1.htm\n\nEpidemiological and laboratory investigations are underway. Several enteroviruses have\nbeen isolated from clinical specimens obtained both from children who died and those with\nuncomplicated hand, foot and mouth disease. Two isolates have been identified as\nenterovirus 71; further identification of the remaining isolates is in progress.",

The cases were\nfrom Sibu, Sarikei and Kuching Divisions at the western end of Sarawak with most cases\ncoming from Sibu. The clinical condition as described by the Sarawak Health Department\ncomprises fever of 2-3 days duration, nervous system involvement manifested as seizures\nand unilateral paralysis of one side of the upper limbs, poor systemic perfusion and at the end\nstage cardiogenic shock due to myocarditis with echocardiogram showing decreased\ncontractability of left ventricle. The presence in some cases of pulmonary oedema and/or\nexanthema and lesions of the buccal mucosa and the palms could suggest the diagnosis of\nfoot and mouth disease as a possibility but this awaits laboratory confirmation (coxsackie\nvirus investigations are under way).\n\nA variety of diagnostic specimens, including stools, respiratory swabs and cerebrospinal\nfluid, are being investigated at the University of Malaya and serological specimens at the\nInstitute of Medical Research in Kuala Lumpur. So far tests for Japanese encephalitis, dengue, yellow fever and rickettsia have been negative.\n\nA team of investigators from the Ministry of Health, consisting of paediatricians,\ncardiologists, epidemiologists, virologists and public health officers has been to Sibu to\nstudy the situation, assist in management and to prevent the spread of the infection.\n\nSarawak has a very well developed public health infrastructure. The local health authorities\nand the public have been alerted. Control measures in place emphasize good personal\nhygiene, especially hand washing, and avoidance of sharing baby pacifiers.

        "Description of the Situation": "01 May 1997 Disease Outbreak Reported\n\nLassa fever re-emerged as a public health problem in Kenema in eastern\nSierra Leone during 1997. From January to 19 April 1997, 799 cases with 148 deaths (CFR\n18.5%) were reported. In the endemic Lassa fever situation an annual average of 40-50 cases\nnormally occurred in this region. An elevated number of Lassa fever cases has continued to\noccur in 1997 with 45 cases reported in January, 75 in February and 147 in March. The\nincreased occurrence is closely related to massive population movements with subsequent\ncrowding, poor sanitation, unsafe food handling and storage practices combined with an\nincrease in the rat population. Furthermore, with the improving political and security\nsituation in Sierra Leone, the populace is moving about more freely to access health care\nfacilities resulting in increased case reporting.\n\nThe Ministry of Health, WHO, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, USA and\nMERLIN, United Kingdom have worked together to monitor the outbreak and to mitigate its\nimpact. Patients are brought to and treated at an isolation ward established in Kenema which\nhas been expanded to accommodate the increase in cases. Several workshops have been held\nto train health staff and to educate the general public about measures to avoid contact with\nrodents. Supplies of ribavirin, the antiviral drug used to treat Lassa virus infections, were\nnearly depleted. The Red Cross was contacted regarding this need and the Chinese Red Cross\nresponded with a donation of 120,000 doses of the drug to the Government of Sierra Leone. WHO is working with the pharmaceutical industry on a long-term solution..\n\n(Based on a report from WHO representative in Sierra Leone.)\n\nComment: Transmission of the Lassa virus in the community is mainly due to contact with\nrats of the genus Mastomys. Infected rats continually shed viruses in their urine and humans\nare infected by ingestion of food contaminated with rat urine or inhalation of virus-containing aerosols. Minimizing contact with rodents by the safe handling and storage\nof food or restricting access of rats to homes, remains therefore the most effective preventive\nmeasure. Person-to-person transmission occurs primarily in health care institutions caring for\nLassa patients. Nosocomial spread can easily be prevented by managing patients in isolation\nwards and with appropriate protective measures (barrier nursing). The risk of transmission\nduring international travel is low unless the traveller is in contact with a severely ill and\nbleeding case. A recent incident involving a virus which causes a similar clinial syndrome\noccurred in South Africa where a nurse was infected with Ebola virus while caring for a\npatient from an endemic area. This underscores the importance of health care staff awareness\nand use of special precautions when treating patients who have travelled abroad.",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "14 April 1997 Disease Outbreak Reported\n\nFollowing reports of ongoing cases of human monkeypox in Zaire representing a new pattern of\nthe disease, the Ministry of Health in Zaire and the World Health Organization (WHO) organized\nan investigation in February 1997. Monkeypox, a disease which closely resembles smallpox,\nis preventable by the vaccination against smallpox.\n\nThe study revealed that this outbreak represents the largest cluster of monkeypox cases ever\nreported, and the proportion of patients that were 15 years of age or older (27%) was higher than\npreviously reported (8%). Young children have been most affected in previous outbreaks. These findings contradict previously accepted findings on the nature of the disease. \n\nStudies over a twenty year period have shown that the rate of transmission of monkeypox within\nhouseholds was low, suggesting that the disease had a low potential for transmission from person\nto person and that an outbreak could not last long after the first patients recovered. However, the\nrecent study has shown that active cases in February 1997 were linked to cases that occurred\nduring the preceding 12 month period. The study also revealed the following:\n\n The rate of transmission from person to person (73%) was higher than previously reported\n(30%). This was associated with the clustering of cases in household compounds and prolonged\nchains of transmission from person to person.\n\n The proportion of deaths (3%) was lower than previously reported (10%). \n\nMonkeypox disease closely resembles ordinary forms of smallpox. The viruses causing the two\ndiseases are related and vaccination against smallpox also protects against monkeypox. The\nemergence of monkeypox does not mean that smallpox, which has been eradicated, is re-emerging. \n\nAll age groups are affected, but children who have not been vaccinated are at the highest risk of\ndeath, about a 10% case fatality rate. Most cases occur in remote villages of Central and West\nAfrica close to tropical rainforests where there is frequent contact with infected animals.\nMonkeypox is usually transmitted to humans from squirrels and primates. \n\nIn the past, an outbreak of monkeypox would not go very far in the village or last long because\nit did not spread extensively after the first patients recovered. However, what concerns WHO\nis that the present study indicates that monkeypox disease is changing its pattern of infection in\nhumans. This outbreak has a much higher rate of person-to-person transmission than seen\nbefore, and spread through many generations of transmission, thus maintaining the outbreak for\nmore than a year.\n\nThe ending of vaccination programmes against smallpox in the late 1970's has probably led to\nan increase in susceptibility to monkeypox and could explain the larger size of the outbreak, the\nhigher proportion of patients aged 15 and over, and the spread through many generations of\ntransmission.\n\nThe changing nature of monkeypox disease is of concern to WHO. In the past, before the\neradication of smallpox in 1980, smallpox vaccination was widespread and protected against\nboth smallpox and monkeypox. Since the eradication of smallpox, vaccination programmes have\nbeen discontinued as recommended by WHO and WHO is concerned that monkeypox could\npose a localized public health problem. WHO will therefore continue to maintain vigilance by\nstrengthening detection systems for monkeypox and completely investigating future outbreaks\nso that the best strategy for prevention and control may be developed. \n\nArticles describing the investigation will simultaneously appear on 11April 1997, in the WHO\nWeekly Epidemiological Record, in the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\nMorbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, and in the next edition of Eurosurveillance. In addition\nto WHO the study partners were from: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Institut\nnational de Recherche biom\u00e9dicale, Kinshasa; Ecole de Sant\u00e9 publique, Kinshasa; the European\nProgramme for Intervention Epidemiology Training (EPIET), Brussels; and M\u00e9dicins Sans\nFronti\u00e8res.",

        "Description of the Situation": "28 March 1997 Disease Outbreak Reported\n\nWHO Consultation, Berlin, Germany, 13-17 October 1997.\n\nThere is increasing concern about the extent to which bacteria pathogenic in humans have\nacquired resistance to antimicrobial drugs. Use of antimicrobial drugs in food animals is known\nas potentially adding to the development of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria of medical\nrelevance. However, the real scope of the medical impact of the use antimicrobials in livestock production is generally unknown.\n\nWHO intends to organize a scientific consultation on the medical impact of use of antimicrobial\ndrugs in food animals in October 1997 in Berlin. The objectives of the consultation are:\n\n\n to review the knowledge of the medical risks regarding antimicrobial resistance in\nbacteria of public health significance associated with the use of different antimicrobial\ndrugs in food animal production\n\n in the context of the development of the WHO Network on Antimicrobial Resistance\nMonitoring to define the needs on monitoring of emergence, mechanisms of\ndevelopment and spread to man of antimicrobial resistance in food and animals at\nnational and international levels\n\n to obtain an international consensus on how to tackle the identified problems.\n\n\n\nWHO will invite about 25 experts in the field of emergence and monitoring of antimicrobial\nresistance, infectious control in community settings as well as on feed additives, food animal\nproduction and veterinary medicine, infectious disease control and antimicrobial resistance\nmonitoring in animal and food production.\n\nDraft scope and purpose of the meeting and a compilation of the major subject areas to be\ndiscussed could be obtained from the below address.

        "Description of the Situation": "08 January 1997 Disease Outbreak Reported\n\nA summary of the outbreak in Gabon\n\nThe current outbreak in Gabon started on 13 July 1997 with the death of a 39-year-old hunter in\na logging camp between the city of Ovan and Koumameyong, near Boou\u00e9, Ogoou\u00e9-Ivindo\nProvince. The second case, a close friend of the hunter became ill and died in August, and the\nthird and four deaths were in a traditional healer and his assistant who treated him. They occurred\nlate in September and blood specimens from them were confirmed Ebola positive on 4 October\nby the Centre International de Recherche de Franceville (CIRMF), Gabon. The outbreak was\nbrought under control and by 13 November 1997, it numbered 24 cases (clinical and\nepidemiological case definition from Kikwit) including 17 deaths and only one known contact\nstill requiring surveillance. However, on 27 October, a doctor infected in Libreville by a case\nlinked to the Boou\u00e9 outbreak, went to South Africa for treatment after having developed\nsymptoms. He subsequently infected a nurse in Johannesburg. The nurse become ill on\nNovember 2 and died on 24 November.\n\nOn 26 November, a previously unidentified contact in Gabon died in the village of Djidjii, near\nBoou\u00e9, and his burial was attended by his brother and his family from Libreville. His brother\ncame back to Libreville with his three children as well as the children of the deceased. All were\nregularly followed up and 3 developed symptoms of Ebola infection and died in a Libreville\nhospital. One of them who became ill on 21 December and died on 30 December, is the last\nrecorded case. As of date 8 January 1997, the outbreak, ongoing since July 1997, has caused 54\ncases including 41 deaths, three hospitalised cases and 10 who have recocered. There has been no documented secondary transmission in Libreville other than that of the doctor who flew to\nSouth Africa. A total of 167 contacts are still under daily surveillance. All known contacts have\nbeen located and are followed up daily. It is possible that few of them may have been infected\nand will therefore develop disease.\n\nInternational travel: WHO does not recommend any travel restriction either to or from Gabon\nor any other Ebola endemic country. However, it is recommended for all travellers going to an\nEbola endemic area, with the specific intention to provide health care or perform laboratory tests\nfrom human or animal specimens, that they be aware of the risk of infection from Ebola and\nother pathogens and adhere strictly to good hygiene and biosafety practices. Travellers arriving\nfrom an Ebola endemic area who have been in physical contact with a case should inform the\nhealth authority immediately on their arrival to ensure daily temperature check up for a period\nof three weeks.\n\n There is no epidemiological evidence that persons infected but asymptomatic are\ninfectious to others. Only symptomatic persons (e.g. contact subject with fever) should be\nconsidered as suspect cases and, consequently, potentially infectious. Since severely ill patients excreting abundant body fluids are not likely to travel, the risk to travellers of becoming infected\nby the Ebola virus during travel is considered negligible. However, the risk of health care\nproviders becoming infected through close physical contact with an Ebola patient should be\nconsidered, even if statistically low. This is particularly important for health workers in areas\nreceiving a significant number of passengers from Ebola endemic areas. For individuals entering\nthe country from an infected area, a simple information leaflet can be used to inform arriving\ntravellers of the need to report any febrile illness occurring up to 21 days after arrival. A\nquestionnaire may be proposed to help tracing if necessary. Such procedures are at the discretion\nof governments and are not required under the International Health Regulations.",
