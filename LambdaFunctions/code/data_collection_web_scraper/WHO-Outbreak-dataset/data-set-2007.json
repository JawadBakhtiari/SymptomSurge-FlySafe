Laboratory tests conducted by the WHO H5 Reference Laboratory in Cairo, Egypt and WHO Collaborating Center for Reference and Research on Influenza, in London, United Kingdom have confirmed the presence of avian influenza virus strain A(H5N1) in samples collected from one case in an affected family. The H5N1 positive case was a 25 year old male from the Peshawar area who developed febrile respiratory illness on 21 November, was hospitalized on 23 November, and died on 28 November. Additional laboratory analysis, including gene sequencing, is ongoing.\n\nAt the request of the Pakistan Government, a WHO team traveled to Pakistan to participate with national authorities in the ongoing investigations of several suspected cases of human H5N1 infections. The following conclusions have been made accordingly:\n\nThe preliminary risk assessment found no evidence of sustained or community human to human transmission.\nAll identified close contacts including the other members of the affected family and involved health care workers remain asymptomatic and have been removed from close medical observation.\n\n\nThe Ministry of Health in Pakistan has taken timely steps to investigate and contain this event including case isolation, contact tracing and monitoring, detailed epidemiological investigations, increasing the availability of personal protective equipment, dedicating hospital facilities for any new suspected cases, and other infection control measures. In addition, agricultural authorities, including the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Livestock and FAO, have been active technical partners for the effective control of this limited outbreak.",

About 64% of those affected are children below 15 years old. \n\nToxicological tests carried out in Munich, Germany, detected very high levels of bromide in 5 out of 6 plasma samples taken from affected patients. Bromide intoxication has been one of the working hypotheses being explored by WHO and partners as a cause of the outbreak. \n\nThe laboratory results provide an important focus for testing on human, environmental and food samples to confirm these bromide levels. Additional samples are currently on the way to a laboratory in the UK for testing for bromides. \n\nOn Wednesday 21 November WHO deployed further technical and operational support to assist Angolan health authorities, including a field coordinator, clinician, two epidemiologists, food safety expert, laboratory specialist, and a logistician. This team will support further epidemiological studies, case management, social mobilization and risk communication, environmental investigations and laboratory testing to confirm the cause of the outbreak, and to support response and control measures.",

The first cases were reported on 2 October. As of 15 November 2007, a total of 370 cases had presented for treatment at the Municipal Hospital in Cacuaco.\n\nIt is anticipated that additional unreported cases may be occurring within communities among patients preferring to remain at home or to receive treatment from traditional healers. The clinical symptoms of the disease are extreme drowsiness, waking only to painful stimuli. Patients recover slowly, over a number of days, but remain ataxic with many unable to walk unaided. The symptoms are most extreme in children.\n\nThe neurological indication is of a cerebellar abnormality with no sign of peripheral neuropathy. Reflexes are normal. The case presentation suggests a toxicological cause, however, the etiological agent has not yet been identified. Samples taken from patients have been tested for 300 organic solvents and a general drug screen covering 800 compounds has also been carried out.\n\nThese tests have so far proved negative. Tests for cadmium, lead, mercury and manganese have shown levels within the normal range. Environmental samples, as well as food and drinking water, have also been taken and results of tests are awaited.\n\nEpidemiological investigations so far have not revealed a common source or route of exposure, and these investigations are now being extended in scope.",

It is anticipated that following this declaration, a well-integrated control program for limiting the disease in both human and animal populations will now be implemented. \n\nThe Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations has deployed a senior animal health expert to the country to assist veterinary services with prevention and control measures in animals. The Ministry of Health and WHO Country Office have presented a plan for the prevention and control of the disease in humans to international donors in Khartoum. The WHO Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office and WHO headquarters are supporting the national response, mobilizing epidemiologists and working with partners to enhance national laboratory capacity for RVF. \n\nSocial mobilization activities are now under-way to alert the local population to the human health risks associated with this disease in animals.

        "Description of the Situation": "7 November 2007\n\nHuman cases of Rift Valley Fever (RVF) continue to increase, with 228 cases and 84 deaths reported as of 7 November. Fifteen localities in White Nile, Sinnar, and Gazeera states are affected. More than 25 human samples have proved positive for Rift Valley fever by PCR or ELISA testing. Laboratory results from three cases in Khartoum state have been found negative for RVF. Results of tests on animal samples remain unavailable.\n\nThe appearance of RVF disease in humans is typically preceded by infection in animals. The RVF virus circulates between ruminant animals (cattle, sheep, goats, and camels) via mosquitoes. During an outbreak, the most significant risk factor for human infection is close contact with infected domestic animals, particularly with their body fluids either directly or via aerosols. However, at times of high vector densities the relative importance of mosquito-to-human transmission may increase.\n\nWith no specific treatment and no effective human vaccine, intensive social mobilization to raise awareness of the risk factors of RVF infection and the protective measures individuals can take to prevent exposure, is the only way to reduce human infection and deaths.\n\nDuring RVF outbreaks, intensive public health messages for risk reduction should focus on:\n\nreducing the risk of animal-to-human transmission as a result of unsafe animal husbandry and slaughtering practices. Gloves and other appropriate protective clothing should be worn and care taken when handling sick animals or their tissues or when slaughtering animals.\nreducing the risk of animal-to-human transmission arising from the unsafe consumption of fresh blood, raw milk or animal tissue. In the epizootic regions, all animal products (blood, meat and milk) should be thoroughly cooked before eating.\nthe importance of personal and community protection against mosquito bites through the use of impregnated mosquito nets, personal insect repellent if available, by wearing light coloured clothing (long-sleeved shirts and trousers) and by avoiding outdoor activity at peak biting times of the vector species.\n\n\nWHO continues to work closely with the Sudan Ministry of Health, as well as other UN and international bodies to support an effective control program for protecting human populations.\nFor more information\n\n\nWHO fact sheet - Rift Valley fever",

It is estimated that more than 30 000 people have fallen ill with acute watery diarrhoea, among which 3 315 were identified as positive for Vibrio cholerae, the bacterium causing the disease. A total of 14 people are known to have died of the disease. The case-fatality rate has remained low throughout the outbreak indicating that those who have become sick have been able to access adequate treatment on time.\n\nThe disease is continuing to spread across Iraq and dissemination to as yet unaffected areas remains highly possible. Epidemiological curves are still rising in the provinces from which the majority of laboratory-confirmed cases have originated, Kirkuk (2309) and Sulaymaniah (870). An increasing number of cases of acute watery diarrhoea has also been reported in Diala, a province neighbouring Baghdad. Although V. cholerae has not yet been laboratory confirmed, the clinical symptoms indicate the presence of cholera. The numbers of cases are remaining stable in Basra, Baghdad, Dahuk, Mosul and Tikrit. However, a case has now been confirmed in Wasit, a province that has previously been unaffected by the outbreak.\n\nThe Government of Iraq has mobilized a multi-sectoral response to the outbreak. Specific control measures have been reinforced and preventive measures to reduce the risk of transmission to unaffected areas have been put in place. However, the overall quality of water and sanitation is very poor, a factor known to greatly facilitate cholera contamination. WHO is in the process of procuring 5,000,000 water-treatment tablets and two international WHO epidemiologists are being deployed to support the Ministry of Health in Iraq.\n\nWHO does not recommend any restrictions to travel or trade to or from affected areas as a means to control the spread of cholera. However, neighbouring countries are encouraged to reinforce their active surveillance and preparedness systems. Mass chemoprophylaxis is strongly discouraged, as it has no effect on the spread of cholera, can have adverse effects by increasing antimicrobial resistance and provides a false sense of security.\n\nUse of the current internationally available prequalified oral cholera vaccine is not recommended once an outbreak has started due to its 2-dose regimen and the time required to reach protective efficacy, high cost and the heavy logistics associated with its use. The use of the parenteral cholera vaccine has never been recommended by WHO due to its low protective efficacy and the high occurrence of severe adverse reactions.\nFor more information\n\n\nPrevention and control of cholera outbreaks: WHO policy and recommendationsWHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean \n\nWHO cholera fact sheet\n\n\nCholera outbreak maps",

The national health authorities are putting in place stringent infection control measures in health centres and hospitals in the affected area to minimize the risk of infection among health care workers. Information and training material on infection control is being prepared and disseminated to provincial health authorities across the country in case additional cases are identified beyond the currently affected area.\n\nThe local health authorities in the affected area are working closely with social mobilization experts, and communication teams to develop key information messages for the local communities. Journalists are preparing and broadcasting radio sketches on the prevention of Ebola as well as providing communities with information on how to recognize its early symptoms and alert the relevant authorities. It is estimated that up to 60% of the local population is being reached through these radio broadcasts.\n\nThe communications teams are also working through local civil society groups including women and youth associations, churches, military units, schools and markets to reach as wide a spectrum of the population as possible. These activities are essential to alert the communities to the risk of transmission while at the same time reducing the panic and fear that are frequently associated with outbreaks of viral haemorrhagic fever.\n\nRetrospective investigations of hospital records are under-way to determine the progress the outbreak took in its initial stages and to document the spread of the epidemic in the first few months.",

        "Description of the Situation": "25 September 2007 \n\nSince late August 2007, an outbreak of cholera has spread to 25 districts of Northern Iraq and 4 districts in Southern Iraq and across the centre of the country. It is estimated that more than 30 000 people have fallen ill with acute watery diarrhoea, among which 2 116 were identified as positive for Vibrio cholerae.  The case fatality rate is 0.52% and has remained low throughout the outbreak, although it continues to spread across Iraq and dissemination to as yet unaffected areas remains highly possible.\n\nThe outbreak was first detected in Kirkuk province, where 68% of laboratory-confirmed cholera cases have so far been reported, and then spread to Sulaymaniah and Erbil provinces. Additional isolated cases of Cholera have also been identified in other parts of the country, including Tikrit (6 cases confirmed), Mosul (2 cases confirmed), Basra (1 case confirmed), Baghdad (2 cases confirmed) and Dahuk (1 case confirmed).\n\nThe Government of Iraq has mobilized a multi-sectoral response to the outbreak. Specific control measures have been reinforced and preventive measures to reduce the risk of transmission to unaffected areas have been put in place. However, a severe shortage of chlorination products has been noted and replenishment is urgently needed to enable water supplies to be treated to render it safe for human consumption. Provision of safe water is the highest priority in controlling an outbreak of cholera.\n\nWHO continues to support the National and local health authorities in the ongoing response operations. Ten interagency diarrhoeal disease kits, each sufficient to treat 400 moderate and 100 severe cases, arrived in Erbil International airport on 16 September. Rapid diagnostic tests are being pre-positioned in remote health care facilities. In addition, 10% of all positive stool samples are being sent to NAMRU 3 reference laboratory(US Navy Advanced Research Unit) in Cairo for further confirmation and phenotypic characterization.\n\nIn controlling the spread of cholera, WHO does not recommend any special restrictions to travel or trade to or from affected areas.\nFor more information\n\n\nPrevention and control of cholera outbreaks: WHO policy and recommendationsWHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean \n\nWHO cholera fact sheet\n\n\nCholera outbreak maps",

        "Description of the Situation": "20 September 2007 \n\nThe Ministry of Health (MoH) of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), with the support of international partners, is continuing field investigations to determine the extent of the outbreak of Ebola haemorrhagic fever in the Province of Kasai Occidental. Active surveillance is under way to investigate recent deaths in the affected communities, to identify other suspected cases and to follow-up on all contacts. Case numbers associated with the outbreak continue to rise and the situation has become further complicated by concomitant reports of cases of typhoid and Shigella dysenteriae type 1.\n\nIsolation wards have been established in the area with the on-going support of a field team from M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (Belgium). Additional isolation wards are also being established in three district hospitals. Epicentre has deployed an epidemiologist to support the MSF team in the field.\n\nOutbreak response field teams are being strengthened and operational bases have been reinforced and established in three towns in the affected area. A central logistics platform is being finalized to provide support to local field communications, to put in place field accommodation facilities and to ensure basic living conditions. The United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUC) is providing additional logistics support.\n\nEpidemiologists, virologists, laboratory experts and logisticians from the MoH, WHO, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) are in the field. Laboratory equipment and outbreak response materials are also being delivered by air with the assistance of MONUC, MSF-chartered flights, and by Interchurch Medical Assistance (IMA World Health), an international non-governmental organization.\n\nMONUC has also assisted WHO in deploying vehicles and other outbreak related response equipment from its Outbreak Logistics Mobility Unit in Dubai. Further shipments of Personal Protective Equipment and specialist communications equipment including satellite phones and radios are also being sent to the country.\n\nSocial mobilization activities are being implemented by national field teams with the support of the national Red Cross, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and UNICEF. A medical anthropologist has been identified by the Centre National de Recherche Scientifique, Paris to work with the social mobilization teams to develop culturally appropriate information concerning Ebola and to ensure the population is provided with information to reduce the risk of transmission of the disease.\n\nExperts in infection control from the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, the H\u00f4pital Cantonal in Geneva and WHO Headquarters are being deployed to strengthen infection control in the affected area. Precautions are also being put in place health care settings in areas beyond the outbreak zone to reduce the risk of any amplification of the outbreak.\n\nOther partners from the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network are also providing support to the MoH, including the African Field Epidemiology Network, the Bernard Nocht Institute, the Centre International de Recherches M\u00e9dicales de Franceville, the European Centre for Disease Control, the Institute Pasteur, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the National University of Singapore, the Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control, Training Programs in Epidemiology and Public Health Interventions Network Inc. and Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, USA.\n\nThe WHO Country Office in Kinshasa has been strengthened to provide support to the MoH in responding to external requests for information on this outbreak.",

        "Description of the Situation": "3 August 2007\n\nMarburg haemorrhagic fever (MHF) has been confirmed in a 29-year-old man in Uganda. The man became symptomatic on 4 July 2007, was admitted to hospital on 7 July and died on 14 July. The disease was confirmed by laboratory diagnosis on 30 July.\n\nThe man had had prolonged close contact with a 21-year-old co-worker with a similar illness to whom he had been providing care. The 21-year-old had developed symptoms on 27 June and was hospitalized with a haemorrhagic illness. He then recovered and was discharged on 9 July. Both men were working in a mine in western Uganda.\n\nThe Ministry of Health (MoH), Uganda, has mobilized national rapid response teams to the area, supported by the World Health Organization (WHO) and other partners in the field, to investigate the outbreak. Laboratory investigations are being supported by the Uganda Virology Research Institute (UVRI), the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta at which the definitive laboratory diagnosis of MHF was made.\n\nCase investigations, including extensive contact tracing and contact monitoring are under-way at the mine, at the health care facilities that cared for the men during their illness, and within the community. Appropriate isolation facilities, active case finding, enhanced surveillance, infection control, safe burial practices and social mobilization activities have been put in place under the oversight of a national Task Force with high level political representation.\n\nInterviews conducted with the mine authorities have identified one additional suspected case and two individuals who were taken ill in mid-June and have since recovered. These individuals are being investigated as a matter of priority. All the miners under investigation for MHF had been at the mine for approximately 8 months with no movements outside the mining area during that time. To date, there have been no reported cases among health care workers.\n\nThe MoH has requested WHO to coordinate international assistance to support the MoH in its outbreak response and containment activities. WHO, along with partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), will also be providing ongoing support in epidemiology, ecological studies, field communications, supplies and logistics. The containment and control measures that have been implemented by the MoH to date are in accordance with international best practice. WHO advises that there is no indication of the need for any restrictions on travel or trade with Uganda.\nFor more information\n\n\nWHO Marburg haemorrhagic fever website",

Thirty-four districts are currently over the epidemic threshold. Cerebrospinal fluid specimens from all affected areas have tested positive for Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A by latex test and/or culture.\n\nTo date, vaccination campaigns have been completed in 15 districts in which 100% of the targeted population of 2.7 million people have been reached. This includes one million people in the capital, Ouagadougou. Vaccination campaigns are still on-going in a further 6 districts. The bivalent vaccine has been secured from The International Coordinating Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision for Epidemic Meningitis Control, as well as from the security stockpiles held by the Ministry of Health of Burkina Faso.\n\nThe recent appeal for financial support for the vaccination campaigns has been positively received by the international community. Contributions have been forthcoming from European Commission Humanitarian Aid Department (ECHO), Medicos del Mundo, M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), Plan Burkina, the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), UNICEF, the UN Central Emergency Response Fund , and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which will enable Burkina Faso to finance all necessary vaccination campaigns.",

Two cases from Arusha and Tanga were confirmed by the WHO-accredited Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) laboratory.\n\nBy mid-February 2007, 8 cases were reported: 4 fatal cases were confirmed by KEMRI, while the remaining 4 cases from Arusha, Mangara and Tanga were hospitalized.\n\nThe United Nations Emergency Coordination Group of WHO, FAO, UNICEF and WFP has been providing support to the Tanzanian Ministry of Health and Ministry of Livestock. In addition to continued technical and financial support, WHO has also provided training in patient care for clinical staff and in diagnostic techniques for laboratory staff. With UNICEF, WHO has also trained journalists and other media staff to increase public awareness about the disease and how to prevent it.\n\nIn mid-March, new clusters of Rift Valley Fever cases occurred. Fifty-eight suspected cases, included 14 deaths, with eight specimens confirmed positive were reported from Dodoma region. In addition, 60 new suspected cases were reported from Morogoro region.\n\nWHO is concerned about the recent increase in human cases. It is particularly important to increase community awareness as well as to improve the coordination with veterinary services to contain the outbreak. A WHO outbreak response team from the Department of Epidemic and Pandemic Alert and Response and the Regional Office for Africa will be assisting the WHO Country Office in the assessment of the outbreak, including the cases in Dodoma and Morogoro, and refining the health component of the emergency response plan, including the early warning system, active case detection, case management and social mobilization.\nFor more information\n\n\nWHO fact sheet on Rift Valley Fever",

WHO is working with the government of Nigeria to carry out intensive surveillance and reports of additional suspected cases may occur as people with influenza-like symptoms seek medical advice.\n\nThe H5N1 avian influenza virus is not transmitted to humans through properly prepared and cooked food. Cases of human infection with H5N1 have frequently been linked to the home slaughter and subsequent handling of diseased or dead birds prior to cooking. These practices represent the highest risk to human infection and are the most important to avoid. When handling raw poultry or live or dead birds, it is imperative to disinfect hands and surfaces with soap and water. Consumers also need to be sure that during the cooking process, poultry reaches temperatures of at least 70\u00b0C in all parts and that eggs are fully cooked throughout.

        "Description of the Situation": "18 January 2007 \n\nViruses with a genetic mutation, linked in laboratory testing to moderately reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir, have been discovered in two persons previously reported  with H5N1 infections in Egypt. Both patients had been on treatment with oseltamivir for two days before the clinical samples that yielded the viruses were taken.\n\nThe two patients from whom samples were taken were a 16 year-old female and a 26 year-old male from Gharbiyah Province, Egypt.1 They were a niece and uncle, respectively, who lived in the same house. The girl was admitted to a hospital on 19 December 2006, while the man was admitted on 17 December. On 21 December they began receiving 2 tablets per day of oseltamivir. On 23 December they were moved to a referral hospital. The samples which have so far been tested were taken from the two patients on 23 December. The girl died on 25 December and the man died on 28 December 2006.\n\nIn this and all other H5N1 investigations there is close, ongoing coordination between Egypt's Ministry of Health and Population (MOH&P) and WHO. It was Egypt's monitoring and rapid virological analysis conducted at the Central Public Health Laboratory in Cairo that initially allowed the diagnoses of H5N1 to be made. Confirmatory testing and genetic sequencing was done at NAMRU-3 and at two WHO Collaborating Centres located in Atlanta, USA and London, UK.\n\nAt this time there is no indication that oseltamivir resistance is widespread in Egypt or elsewhere. WHO is not making any changes in antiviral treatment recommendations for H5N1-infected persons published in June 2006 because the clinical level of resistance of these mutations is not yet well established. Current laboratory testing suggests that the level of reduced susceptibility is moderate. This mutation has previously been identified in Viet Nam in one case in 2005. Moreover, these mutations are not associated with any known change in the transmissibility of the virus between humans. Based on these considerations, the public health implications at this time are limited. Finally, these findings do not indicate a need for a change in phase level. The WHO pandemic preparedness level remains at three.\n\nThe Egyptian authorities, WHO and its Collaborating Centres will continue to share with the public all relevant information from the on-going investigations and analyses as soon as it becomes available.\n\n\n1The ages and dates in this update related to the two patients, may differ slightly from earlier reports, but reflect the most recent information provided to WHO.",
