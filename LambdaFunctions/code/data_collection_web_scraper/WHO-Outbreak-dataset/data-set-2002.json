Neglected but treatable diseases\nhave taken hold throughout this long history of conflict and defeated\nthe efforts of doctors and clinics to bring them under control.\n\nOne of the most serious examples is a\ndisfiguring disease known by various names including Kandahar sore (scientific name\ncutaneous leishmaniasis). This is a condition caused by a parasite transmitted by insect\nbites that leads to disfiguring facial injuries and long-term disability. As a result,\nthose affected are often stigmatized.\n\nWomen and children are particularly\naffected and in some cases women may be treated as outcasts by their communities. In some\nareas, the disease is so widespread that it is known as \"Little Sister\" because\nit is almost a part of the family. But in Kabul today there is an opportunity to bring it\nunder control and end the suffering endured by so many people.\n\nTwo hundred thousand people are believed to\nbe infected with this parasite in Kabul alone. Due to their lower levels of resistance to\nthe disease, returning refugees and other displaced persons in Kabul are at higher risk of\ninfection. International staff working in Afghanistan also face a substantially higher\nrisk.\n\nThe World Health Organization, together\nwith the government of Afghanistan and a number of international NGOs, is launching an\nurgent appeal for funds to bring this serious outbreak under control. This is one case\nwhere a remarkably small amount of money could make an enormous difference.\n\n\"A little over one million dollars is\nall we need to fund a two-year programme that would have a huge, long-term impact on this\ndisfiguring disease once and for all,\" said Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland,\nDirector-General of the WHO. \"But we need to act now: if this opportunity is missed,\nthere will be a severe increase in the number of cases next year.\"\n\nIt is vital that this emergency response is\nlaunched as soon as possible. Because this form of leishmaniasis is passed from person to\nperson via the bite of a sandfly, the infection can spread rapidly in a concentrated\npopulation, particularly among the poor. The sandflies breed quickly in unsanitary\nconditions. After biting an infected person, the sandflies spread the disease each time\nthey bite.\n\nTransmission occurs from May to October,\nbut new cases may not emerge for another several months because of the long incubation\nperiod of the disease. However, it is vital to interrupt transmission in order to avoid a\nsharp increase in the number of cases over the next year. A rapid response now also allows\na long-term control plan to be put in place, to prevent this disease from taking an even\nstronger hold in Afghanistan.\n\nThe WHO emergency plan involves a rapid\nintervention combining preventive and curative measures with drugs for mass treatment,\ninsecticide impregnated bednets for individual protection, social mobilization, and health\neducation to ensure that this disabling disease of poverty can be brought under control.",
