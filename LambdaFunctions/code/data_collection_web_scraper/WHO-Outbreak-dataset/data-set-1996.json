        "Description of the Situation": "24 December 1996 Disease Outbreak Reported\n\nThe Ministry of Health of Gabon issued a press release on 19 December giving the\nlatest information on the outbreak of Ebola haemorrhagic fever and describing the measures\nbeing taken to control it.\n\nThe outbreak was originally declared on 10 October 1996, with cases occurring in the region of\nBooue. Measures were taken immediately to control the spread of infection both in the villages\nand hospitals with the assistance of a WHO team. Health personnel received training and a\npublic information campaign was launched. It appeared initially that the outbreak was being\nbrought under control. However, at the beginning of December another outbreak occurred in the\nBooue region, causing 8 deaths. Despite advice to the contrary, some contacts left the region and\ntravelled to Lastourville, where one case was admitted to hospital, and to Libreville where two\ncases have died during the past week. These cases in Libreville were children who accompanied\ntheir father to attend the burial ceremony of a deceased Ebola patient in Booue.\n\nThe Ministry of Health has made every effort to trace all persons who have been in contact with\nEbola patients and to instruct the public on the imperative need to cooperate with the control\nefforts organized by the government. The Ministry is now satisfied that all contacts have been\ntraced and placed under medical supervision. Seminars and training courses are being held for\nall personnel involved in the control operation, for which attendance is obligatory.\n\nIn Booue district, to date there have now been approximately 40 cases with 30 deaths since the\nstart of the epidemic. 9 cases are presently convalescing. In the past few days there have been\n4 new cases with 1 death on 23 December.\n\nThe Ministry of Health and WHO are holding a press conference in Libreville today at 16h00\nlocal time. The press conference will be open to all interested journalists and is being held to\nprovide full information to the public about the outbreak and the measures being taken to end it,\nand to reassure the public that the situation is fully under control.",

Yellow fever:\n\n\n\n\n All travellers arriving from countries known to be infected with yellow fever (as shown in\nthe WHO Weekly Epidemiological Record) must present a valid yellow-fever vaccination\ncertificate in accordance with the International Health Regulations. In the absence of such a\ncertificate, the person will be vaccinated upon arrival and placed under strict surveillance for 6\ndays from the day of vaccination or the last date of potential exposure to infection - whichever\nis earlier. Health offices available at entry points will be responsible for notifying the appropriate\nDirector General of Health Affairs, in the region or governorate, about the place of residence of\nthe visitor.\n\n  Aeroplanes and other means of transportation arriving from areas infected with yellow\nfever are requested to submit a certificate indicating disinsection in line with the International\nHealth Regulations. \n\nII. Meningococcal meningitis\n\n\n\n For all arrivals. Visitors from all over the world arriving for the purpose of \"Umra\" or\npilgrimage or for seasonal work are requested to produce a certificate of vaccination against\nmeningitis issued not more than 3 years and less than 10 days before arrival in Saudi Arabia. The responsible authorities in the country from where the visitor comes must ensure that\nvaccination has been carried out as follows:\n\n\nAdults and children over the age of 2 years must be given one dose of the A/C vaccine\nChildren between 3 months and 2 years of age must be given two doses of the A vaccine with a 3-month interval between the two doses.\n\n\n\n  Arrivals from countries in the African meningitis belt. It must be ensured that all visitors\nfrom these countries have been vaccinated in their countries, not more than 3 years and not less\nthan 10 days before arrival. This should be documented on the vaccination certificate.\n\nVisitors from these countries will be checked at entry points to ensure that they are vaccinated.\nSuspect cases, shall be isolated and preventive measures will be taken in respect of their direct\ncontacts. If the authenticity of the vaccination certificate is felt to be questionable, revaccination\nis to be carried out. \n\nChemoprophylaxis will be administered to all visitors from these countries to lower the carrier\nrate among them.\n\nIII. Diphtheria\n\n\nVisitors arriving for pilgrimage or \"Umra\" purposes from the countries of the former USSR are\nrequested to present a certificate indicating diphtheria vaccination. They will also be given one\ndoes of benzathene penicillin as follows:\n\n600 000 units for persons weighing less than 30 kg;\n1 200 000 units for adults and children weighing more than 30 kg.\n\n\nThose allergic to penicillin should, instead, be given erythromycin, as follows: \n\n\nadults: 1 g daily (divided equally into four doses) for one week;\nchildren: 40 mg per kg body weight, daily (divided equally into four doses) for one week.\n\nFor all the above, certificates should be issued either in Arabic, English or French; in addition,\na copy in the official language of the country of origin may be enclosed.\n\nIV. Epidemiological surveillance\n\n\nTight control is exercised on entry points in respect of pilgrims and \"Umra\" visitors, and\nthorough surveillance shall be made in respect of visitors coming from countries infected with\ndiseases subject to the International Health Regulations, in addition to isolation of suspect cases\nand surveillance of their contacts.\n\nV.

        "Description of the Situation": "28 November 1996 Disease Outbreak Reported\n\n\nSummary:\n\n\nFrom 15 to 21 November 1996 an estimated 500 000 refugees returned from East\nZaire to Rwanda across the border at Gisenyi, a small Rwandese town next to the Zairian town\nof Goma. More than 90% of them crossed the border during the first three days. The massive\nand rapid influx of returnees occurred on an unexpectedly large scale and could have had very\nserious public health consequences. About 14 000 consultations and 47 deaths were registered\nby the epidemiological\nsentinel stations in place. Diarrhoeal diseases accounted\nfor two-thirds of all consultations. The crude mortality rate\nwas estimated to 0.1/ 10 000/day (based on a denominator\nof 500 000). In view of the potential risks associated with\nsuch a massive population movement, this figure can be\nconsidered a success.\n\nThe first groups of returnees arrived in\nGoma on 15 November 1996. They were held in the\nPetite Barri\u00e8re camp and released to relieve the pressure\ncreated by a massive influx of new arrivals. \"Way stations\"\nwere installed every 5 to 6 km on the route according to a\npreestablished plan as soon as these arrivals were\nannounced. Water, protein biscuits and some basic care,\nessentially oral and intravenous rehydration, were\nprovided. Two transit centres were opened for further\nhealth care. Local health centres were also contributing,\nparticularly those along the route of the returnees. Food\ndistribution was limited to protein biscuits since any\nslowdown could have caused panic and stampedes, and\nwould also worsen the risk of epidemics.\n\n\nEpidemiological surveillance\n\nSimple and practical\nforms for surveillance were developed mainly to detect\nillness with epidemic potential. The forms were distributed\nin advance to health centres concerned and to non-governmental organizations involved health care and\nworking in the Gisenyi Prefecture.\n\nMedical coordination was established in the regional health\ndirectorate under the chairmanship of the medical director\nof the health region concerned with technical support of\nthe representative from WHO on site. Members of the\nhealth directorate, medical representatives of the UN\nagencies and NGOs involved met formally on a daily\nbasis.\n\nThe epidemiological information presented below was\ncollected in the \"way stations\" on the transit route, the\ntransit centres and local health units. The NGOs such as\nAHA, COOPI, Merlin, MDM and MSF provided\nepidemiological data collected in the districts they had\nbeen allocated. Crude morbidity and mortality rates were\ncalculated on a denominator of 500 000 population\nalthough the exact number is not known. \n\nIn addition to medical coordination and data collection, a\nplan of action in the event of a cholera epidemic was\nestablished with the health authorities.\n\nResults:\n\n\nA total of 14 160 consultations were registered\nfrom 16 to 21 November 1995. The peak of the\nconsultations was on the third day of the migration. On\nthis day, almost all returnees were still within the District of\nGisenyi. Acute diarrhoeal disease was the main complaint\nand amounted to 9,407 or 66% of all registered\nconsultations. The peak of the consultations for diarrhoea\nalso occurred on the third day of the migration and then\ndecreased (see table 1).\n\nOnly 319 cases of bloody diarrhoea were reported, with no\ndeaths. In 23 cases of watery diarrhoea, Vibrio cholerae\n01 El Tor was isolated from faecal samples by the\nlaboratory in the central hospital in Kigali. None of the\nconfirmed cases of cholera was severe or needed\nantibiotic treatment. This was fortunate as the V.cholerae\nstrains isolated were resistant to doxycycline, tretracyline\nand cotrimoxazole. There were 38 deaths from diarrhoeal\ndisease (CFR=0.4%). One case of measles and a case\nof suspected meningitis were registered.\n\nIt seems likely that many patients who consulted for acute\ndiarrhoea were in reality exhausted and dehydrated after\ntheir long and sustained effort. Many presented with\nvomiting and stomach cramp and many complained of\nmuscular cramp. No blood tests were done to investigate\nbut it seems likely they suffered from hypoglycaemia and\nhypokalaemia. The patients recovered after receiving\nperfusion (Ringer's lactate) and a few protein biscuits and\ncould continue their route.\n\nComment\n\nThe public health indicators are surprisingly\ngood considering the massive repatriation taking place in\na short time. A crude mortality rate of 0.1 per 10,000/day\ncompares well with the mortality rate of 0.3/10 000/day\nestimated in the Mugunga camp where the refugee\npopulation stayed earlier. However, further steps need to\nbe taken to strengthen preparedness in case of future\nmassive population movements. This is particularly true\nif the health status of the population concerned continues\nto be precarious. The lessons learnt have served as a\nbasis for recommendations for the future.",

        "Description of the Situation": "18 November 1996 Disease Outbreak Reported\n\nA case of Ebola haemorrhagic fever was\nconfirmed in a nurse on 16 November. The illness started\nwith mild fever on 2 November and progressed to severe\nheadache on 6 November when she was admitted to\nhospital with suspected encephalitis. No evidence of\nencephalitis was found in cerebrospinal fluid. The patient\ndeveloped a fine rash and diarrhoea and platelet count\nwhich had been low on admission continued to fall. This\nwas accompanied by marked leukopenia and abnormal\nliver enzyme tests. Immunofluorescence test of serum\nwas negative for Ebola virus and a range of other\nhaemorrhagic fever viruses on 9 November. On 14\nNovember, serum inoculated into cell cultures gave\npositive IF reaction to Ebola virus. Serological results\nfurther confirmed the diagnosis. This is the first case of\nEbola fever diagnosed in South Africa. Tracing the\nsource of the infection established that the nurse had been\nexposed on 29 October to the blood of a very ill doctor\nwho had been brought from Libreville, Gabon on 27\nOctober. The doctor recovered and was discharged on\n11 November to convalesce in a nearby facility. He had\nantibody to Ebola virus; virus isolation is being attempted\nfrom blood specimens collected during his acute illness.\nThe nurse was in a critical but stable state on 17\nNovember. Immediately after the laboratory confirmation,\ncommittees were established to oversee infection control,\ncontact tracing and observation, and all other aspects of\noutbreak control. \n\nThe information was received from the National Institute\nfor Virology, Sandringham, South Africa which works in\nclose collaboration with WHO. The Institute posts further\ndetails on its web page at http://www.healthlink.org.za/niv. \n\nThe Government of Gabon is aware of the situation and\nhas indicated to WHO that they are currently conducting\nfurther investigations to determine whether this case is\nlinked to cases in the recent outbreak in Boou\u00e9.",

The information below is based on a report by Spanish health authorities. Travellers are\nrecommended to consult with their local physician for advice if necessary.\n\nDeaths from suspected meningococcal infection have been reported in two children visiting\nMallorca in May. The first was in a 13 year-old who arrived from the United Kingdom on\n18 May, had onset of illness the day after and died 20 May. The second death occurred in an 11\nyear-old tourist from Germany who arrived 17 May, had onset of clinical illness on 21 May, and\ndied 22 May. They stayed in the same hotel. Pending etiological confirmation, close case\ncontacts are receiving chemoprophylaxis.\n\nMeningococcal infection has been reported in two other tourists from the United Kingdom\nstaying at different hotels and without a history of contact with each other or the two fatal cases. One was a 5-years-old girl who arrived in Mallorca on 14 May, with onset of illness on 23 May\nand hospitalized the following day. She was still in hospital on 28 May. Neisseria meningitidis\ngroup C has been identified as the infectious agent. Case contacts have received\nchemoprophylaxis and have been recommended vaccination. The second confirmed case was\nin a 3-year-old boy who arrived in Mallorca on 4 May, and hospitalized since 17 May.\n\nThe reported incidence of meningococcal infection in the Balearic Isles was low for the first 13\nweeks of 1996 with a total of 4 notified cases against an average of 10 cases for the same period\nin the preceding five years. Identification of the serogroup and serotype of these cases is\nunderway.\n\nComment: Meningococcal disease is contagious and caused by the meningococcus\nN. meningitidis which is transmitted through direct contact with an infected person, including\nrespiratory droplets from nose and throat. The infection persists in the community by healthy\ncarriers. Of the two clinical forms of meningococcal disease, meningococcal meningitis is the\nmore common while meningococcal septicaemia is less common but more often fatal.\n\n In view of the often rapid clinical progression of meningococcal disease, early treatment of\nsuspected cases with antibiotics is recommended. Chemoprophylaxis should be offered to close\ncontacts of the index case. Surveillance of household and other close contacts for early signs of\nillness, especially fever, is necessary to initiate appropriate therapy without delay.\nMeningococcal vaccines that protect against serogroups A, C, W135 and Y are available.",

Following reports on outbreaks in neighbouring countries, the health authorities implemented\na preparedness strategy of strengthened surveillance, public health information campaigns and distribution of 20 000 doses vaccines and drugs to each of the 8 regions in December 1995. In\nthe strengthened surveillance system, each local health centre provides weekly reports to\nperipheral health centres for forwarding on to the regional and central health authorities. Most\ndistrict health centres have radio communication links with the peripheral health services.\n\nSince 15 March 1996 the national health authorities have allocated 200 million CFA for vaccine\nand field operations and have ordered 1 million doses of vaccine and other material needed for\nthe campaign. In addition, international agencies such as WHO, UNICEF, MSF, Fondation pour\nl'Enfance have contributed about 700 000 doses.

Although the Ebola virus-Reston strain has not been found to cause\nillness among humans, the Department of Health in collaboration with DENR/PAWB and the\nDepartment of Agriculture/BAI started investigation on April 18 1996 to determine the health-related effects to humans and monkeys exposed to the virus.\n\nA multi-agency committee was formed to conduct an investigation. The members of the\ncommittee are: 1) the Department of Health (Field Epidemiology Training Programme, Research\nInstitute of Tropical Medicine and the Bureau of Research Laboratories), 2) Department of\nEnvironment and Natural Resources (Protected Areas and Wildlife Bureau) and 3) Department\nof Agriculture (Bureau of Animal Industry).\n\nMethodology: An FETP team visited and interviewed personnel of Ferlite Scientific Research\nInc. Using a standard symptom survey questionnaire. The signs and symptoms of Ebola\ninfection include: High grade fever, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, cough\njaundice, lymphadenopathy, CNS disturbances, and hemorrhagic tendencies like maculopapular\nrash, petechiae, nose and gum bleeding, hematemesis, hemoptysis, and black stools.\n\nVisual inspection of the monkey farm was also conducted.\n\nResults: There were 20 employees at the monkey farm. Eighteen were interviewed. All were\nmales. Eleven (61%) were caretakers, 4 (22%) were veterinarians, 2 (11%) were carpenters, and\n1 (5%) housekeeper. Twelve (67%) had history of injuries (bites and scratches). All were\nnegative for any of the listed signs and symptoms related to Ebola infection.\n\nTwo employees found to be positive for Ebola antibody in the 1993 one in the 1990 studies are\nstill working in the farm.\n\nThe ferlite Scientific Research, Inc. Monkey farm is situated in a 2.5 to 3-hectare area in\nCalamba, Laguna, about 40km. South of Manila. They have open cages as their holding\nfacilities. The quarantine facility consists of individual cages. in 1995 they exported monkeys\nto the USA and Europe (Sweden). In 1996, they exported 100 monkeys to Hazleton, Alice,\nTexas, USA. A second batch of 100 monkeys to be exported to the same facility is still in their\nquarantine facility.\n\nCurrent monkey population is 1600. The monkeys used for breeding come from Zamboanga and\nIligan city. The last replacement of breeders were in November 1995. The monkeys are\nquarantined 30 days prior to shipment.",

The disease in these cases differs from classical CJD in several respects:\n\n\nearly age (CJD is usually a disease of older people)\ndifferences in pathological changes in the brain\nabsence of any hereditary factors (which are involved in typical CJD)\n\nThere is no direct evidence of a link between these cases and bovine spongiform\nencephalitis (BSE). However, in the absence of any apparent cause, the most likely\nexplanation at present is that these cases are linked to exposure to BSE before control\nmeasures were instituted in the UK in 1989. The measures now in force in the UK are\nconsidered to have minimized any possible risk from eating beef.\n\n No similar pattern of disease has been recognized in humans in any other country\nalthough BSE has also occurred in animals in Ireland, France, Portugal, and Switzerland.
