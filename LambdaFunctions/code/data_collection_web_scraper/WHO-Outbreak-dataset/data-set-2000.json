These are the first cases of Ebola ever reported in Uganda.\n\nAs of 16 October 2000, 71 suspected cases,\nincluding 35 deaths, have been reported. Cases were first reported in a local hospital in\nGulu town and are now occurring in the community.\n\ncoordinating the international response to the outbreak,\nimplementing disease control measures, such as barrier nursing procedures,\ncase finding, contact tracing and monitoring, and\nsupplying protective equipment.\n\n\nThe Ugandan Ministry of Health has\nestablished a National Task Force for the Control of Viral Haemorrhagic Fevers, for\nmanaging the response to the epidemic. WHO is supporting the Ministry of Health and this\nTask Force in disease containment by:\n\nEpidemiologists from the WHO African\nRegional Office and the WHO office in Kampala, Uganda are already assisting with\ninvestigation and implementation of control measures.

This viral haemorrhagic fever causes severe\ndisease amongst both humans and animals, posing a serious public health risk and economic\nlosses due to loss of livestock. \n\nIn September 2000, RVF was reported for the\nfirst time outside Africa. Cases were confirmed in Saudi\nArabia and Yemen. As of 9 October 2000, 321 cases with 32 deaths, and a case fatality rate\nof 10%, have been reported by the Ministry of Public Health, Yemen.\n\nThe response requires strengthening the\nbasic infrastructure, epidemiological surveillance and human resources in Yemen that are\nneeded for dealing with this emergency. In particular, the economic impact of the\nrestriction on animal movement and trade is causing severe hardship amongst local\ninhabitants.\n\nHigh-level agreement between Saudi Arabia\nand Yemen to conduct a joint investigation has ensured effective coordination of the\ninternational response to control the disease on both sides of the border. WHO experts are\nworking with both governments in the outbreak zone.\n\nFunds mobilized through the WHO Appeal will\nhelp to control and contain the outbreak of RVF within the immediately affected districts\nin Yemen, and build local capacity to predict and prevent further occurrence.\n\nThe Appeal seeks support for vector\nsurveillance and control, strengthening laboratory capacity, capacity building and human\nresource development, strengthening epidemiological surveillance of RVF and providing\nessential supplies, equipment and critical supportive materials.\n\nAn urgent response to the Appeal is needed\nto assist the Government of Yemen and strengthen local capacity to take effective action\non the first reported cases of RVF outside traditionally-affected areas in Africa.\n\nRVF is a zoonotic disease. It primarily\naffects animals (cattle, sheep, camels, goats) but can cause outbreaks of disease in\nhumans. Usually, the virus is spread by the bite of infected mosquitoes. During RVF\noutbreaks, people become infected with RVF either by being bitten by mosquitoes or through\ncontact with the blood, other body fluids or organs of infected animals. Such contact may\noccur during the care or slaughtering of infected animals or possibly from the ingestion\nof raw milk.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________________\n\nFor more information on Rift Valley fever\nin Yemen please see previous report.",

It is important to\nestablish whether this is a new introduction of the virus or whether, in fact, the\npathogen has been present for some time and only now has come to the attention of public\nhealth authorities. Ecological studies are being carried out to determine the factors that\nmay have triggered the outbreak.\n\nHigh-level agreement between Saudi Arabia\nand Yemen to conduct a joint investigation has ensured effective coordination of the\ninternational response to control the disease on both sides of the border. Saudi Arabia\nand Yemen are sharing useful information, including the investigation protocols, and there\nis good logistic coordination across the border.\n\nWHO Rift Valley Fever expert Dr Ray Arthur\nhas played a key role investigating and responding to previous RVF outbreaks. \"I'm\nworking with both governments in the outbreak zone to facilitate coordination of the\ninvestigation and implement control procedures across the border,\" he stated.\n\nIn Yemen, WHO and partners are assisting\nwith the control of an acute haemorrhagic fever syndrome (suspected to be Rift Valley\nFever). Laboratory studies are under way to confirm that the observed disease is in fact\nRVF.

A report of one case in a third district has not yet been verified. Laboratory results have confirmed\u00a0 yellow fever IgM in 1 of 5 clinical samples sent to Institut Pasteur, Abidjan, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, for testing; virus detection is now underway in this and the other samples.\n\nThese cases were detected following training in integrated surveillance for district surveillance officers in the county. As this training is introduced in the other counties, the outbreak may prove to be more extensive. Other districts are now beginning to detect suspected cases.\n\nAll cases which have been investigated have occurred among unvaccinated persons. The most recent YF vaccination campaign in the area was conducted in 1999 but was limited to a single refugee camp. Most of the refugees who were vaccinated in that exercise have left the area. A nationwide YF vaccination campaign was conducted in 1995, but coverage was reported to be low, leaving much of the population susceptible.\n\nThe population in the Grand Cape Mount County lives in small villages or towns of approximately 5-10 000 people. There is a lot of movement across the border with Sierra Leone. The road between Grand Cape Mount County and the capital of Liberia, Monrovia, is in good condition and there is a considerable amount of traffic to and from Monrovia. If YF were introduced in Monrovia there would be 1.5 million people at risk.\n\nIn response to the outbreak, the MOH, Liberia, WHO, and health sector non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have agreed to:  implement a mass vaccination campaign targeting the 150 000 population immediately at risk. WHO is providing vaccine and autodestruct syringes for this campaign.  intensify vaccination and surveillance in the affected communities and other districts not yet known to be affected. \n\nWHO is seeking to mobilize support for YF detection and response activities.",

        "Description of the Situation": "20 June 2000 Disease Outbreak Reported\n\nThe recent report of illness amongst 8 young children in\nVladivostock who had played with discarded ampoules of smallpox vaccine has now been\nconfirmed by the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation. Laboratory confirmation of\nthe illness in the children is being sought. The report has evoked much public concern. In\nsome of the reports, there were misconceptions about the components of the vaccine used to\nprevent smallpox, and about why any country might still be retaining stocks of smallpox\nvaccine. This note aims to clarify these issues.\n\n1) Smallpox vaccine is not made from smallpox virus.\n\nThe vaccine which was used for centuries to vaccinate\nagainst smallpox was not made from smallpox, but from vaccinia virus. Vaccinia is a\ndifferent virus from the virus which causes smallpox. However, it is a member of the same\nfamily of viruses to which the smallpox virus belongs. The smallpox virus is also known as\nvariola virus. Mass vaccinations with smallpox vaccine made from vaccinia virus led to the\neradication of smallpox announced by WHO in 1980. People vaccinated with smallpox vaccine\n(vaccinia) develop reactions to it which range from mild and transient to severe, and very\nrarely, fatal.\n\n2) Two countries still keep smallpox virus (variola)\nstocks.\n\nAlthough smallpox disease has been eradicated, two\nlaboratories still hold stocks of smallpox virus (variola). These are the WHO\nCollaborating Centres in Atlanta, USA and Koltsovo, Russian Federation.\n\n3) Many countries still hold smallpox vaccine (vaccinia)\nstocks.\n\nWHO recommends that countries which still have stocks of\nsmallpox vaccine (vaccinia) maintain these stocks. This recommendation has been made for\ntwo reasons. Firstly, small amounts of vaccine are still needed to vaccinate laboratory\npersonnel handling vaccinia virus and other members of this virus family. Some of these\nviruses are found in nature and cause illness among animals, and some are used in research\nto make new, safer vaccines against a variety of infectious diseases. Secondly, smallpox\nvaccine (vaccinia) will also be needed in case of a deliberate or accidental release of\nsmallpox virus (variola), which is a very unlikely event but currently of great concern to\nsome countries.\n\nFor further information on this topic, see the summary of the recent meeting of the WHO\nAdvisory Committee on Variola Virus Research, published in the Weekly Epidemiological\nRecord.\n\n4) Disposal of biological materials and pharmaceuticals\n\nAll biological materials and pharmaceuticals such as\nvaccines, drugs and diagnostic specimens should be disposed of safely. Some may require\ninactivation before disposal. This can be accomplished by autoclaving or incineration.",

However, the name of the brand has not yet been\nidentified and the Pasteur Institute in Paris is screening Listeria monocytogenes\nfood isolates to detect the epidemic clone.\n\nFood contaminated with L. monocytogenes is a significant source of illness and\ndeath worldwide. The case-fatality rate in recent outbreaks and sporadic cases is around\n20%-30%. From early August 1998 to 6 January 1999, at least 50 cases caused by a rare\nstrain of the bacterium L. monocytogenes, serotype 4b, were reported in the United\nStates.

A team from the\nMinistry of Health was sent to the affected area and was joined by an epidemiologist and\nwater sanitation officer from the WHO office.\n\nThe WHO team visited the 2 health centres where most cases had been reported and\nchecked the records from January 1997 to 15 January 2000 which showed that the number of\ncases had risen beyond the expected seasonal figures from November 1999 to January 2000.\nAs of 15 January 2000 a total of 1 862 cases with 28 deaths had been reported and adults\nwere more affected than children.\n\nProblems identified were lack of protection of latrines and inadequate water supplies.\nAll unprotected water springs/wells which were inspected were contaminated while most of\nthe protected springs had good quality water.\n\nControl measures were initiated which included intensive health education and case\nmanagement. Laboratory confirmation of the causative pathogen and analysis of sensitivity\nto drugs is still awaited. Currently the number of cases appears to be decreasing and the\nMinistry of Health has sufficient medical supplies to deal with this outbreak.",
