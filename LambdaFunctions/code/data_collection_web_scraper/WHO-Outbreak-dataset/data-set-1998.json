        "Description of the Situation": "04 December 1998 Disease Outbreak Reported\n\nThere have recently been reports of a small number of deaths and a\nlarger number of cases of diarrhoea (with and without vomiting) in the province of Cabo\nDelgado. This outbreak has been attributed to the consumption of fish contaminated with\npesticides, but little scientific data are available to substantiate these claims.\nConcurrently, there are outbreaks of both cholera and dysentery in the country and local\nhealth services have difficulty differentiating between symptoms of chemical poisoning and\nillness caused by microbial pathogens. Approximately 100 deaths have occurred and about\n600 cases of illness have been reported by the provincial health authorities, but\nattributing these to either chemical or microbiological contamination of food or water\nconsumed is not possible because of lack of reliable scientific data.\n\nAccording to local health authorities in Cabo Delgado, there have been\n2 deaths since 24 November, and the outbreak is under control. Data from the Ministry of\nHealth suggest that most of the cases of diarrhoea reported in Cabo Delgado province have\nbeen associated with cholera and dysentery, rather than with pesticide poisoning. Thus\ncaution is advised in the absence of reliable epidemiological data.\n\nIt would appear that the \"toxic event\" associated with pesticide poisoning\nhas passed its peak. The consumption of dried fish may be a possible route of exposure to\ntoxic levels of pesticides, as the use of non-food-grade pesticides has been frequently\nreported in different parts of the world as a method for reducing insect spoilage of dried\nfish. The fisheries services in Mozambique are taking the appropriate prevention and\ncontrol measures, and are collecting samples to be forwarded to an international reference\nlaboratory for analysis. WHO has assembled a multidisciplinary advisory team in\nconsultation with the national government agencies concerned and FAO.",

        "Description of the Situation": "26 November 1998 Disease Outbreak Reported\n\nPAHO/WHO REPORT ON THE EPIDEMIOLOGICAL\nSITUATION IN CENTRAL AMERICA\n\nCholera: As of November 20, the Ministry of Public Health has reported six cases\nand one death (San Alejo, La Union). V. cholera 01 El Tor Owaga has been isolated in one\ncase. Of the six reported cases, four were imported from Jutiapa, Guatemala; the other two\noriginated in border areas of El Salvador (Metep\u00e1n, Santa Ana and San Alejo, La Uni\u00f3n.)\nOn 19 November, an outbreak of diarrheal disease erupted in the San Juan de Dios Hospital\nin the department of Santa Ana on the Guatemala border. All fifteen cases required\nhospitalization. This is a suspected outbreak of cholera which is attributed to ingestion\nof food sold by a street vendor from Jutiapa, Guatemala. The Ministry of Health initiated\na public information and health education campaign and launched activities to control the\ndisease, targeting the areas along the Guatemala border.\n\nCholera: The Surveillance Department of the Ministry of Health reported that\nbetween 4-20 November there were 234 confirmed cases of cholera out of a total of 261\nreported. There were 17 deaths. On 20 November, an outbreak was reported in the Mental\nHealth Hospital of Guatemala, with 18 confirmed cases and one death. In Chinaltenango that\nsame day, there were 27 suspected cases and 37 confirmed cases, which correspond to the\ncumulative total notified cases for that area in the last two weeks. All reported\noutbreaks implied food-borne transmission.\n\nReporting by epidemiological weeks (through Week 45-November 14), as reported by the\nHealth Information Management System (SIGSA) on 19 November, shows a clear rise in cholera\nbeginning in Week 37 (September 13). However, this information service reports 395 cases\nof cholera during Week 44 (November 1-7) and 511 cases during Week 45 (November 8-14),\nsharply higher than the figures reported by the Surveillance Department of the Ministry of\nHealth. Diagnostic measures have been strengthened and treatment of cases and contacts\nstepped up.\n\nLeptospirosis: On 23 November, the Surveillance Department reported six cases of\nleptospirosis, five of which were confirmed. Four of the cases occurred in Guatemala City\nand two in Escuintla. No deaths were reported. \n\nDengue: SIGSA reports 277 cases of dengue for Week 45, a rise of almost 200\ncases from the previous week. \n\nMalaria: According to SIGSA, the situation is stable.\n\nCholera: As of 22 November, the Ministry of Health reported 335 cases of\ncholera, 301 of which were confirmed. Managua reported 156 cases or 52% , followed by\nCarazo (46 cases), Masaya (25) and Matagalpa (18 cases). According to an analysis of\ntrends by the Epidemiological Surveillance System, one can observe an increase in Week 45,\nwith 102 cases. Seventy-five were reported the preceding week. The Ministry of Health has\ntaken measures to treat the cases, distribute chlorine, and conduct community education\nand environmental health campaigns.\n\nLeptospirosis: Up to 22 November, the Ministry of Health reported 264 suspected\ncases of leptospirosis, 98.1% of which were in Chinandega and Estel\u00ed (136 and 123 cases\nrespectively). Of the 182 samples processed in laboratories, 42 resulted positive for\nLeptospira (23%). The Ministry of Health is sending medical brigades and epidemiologists\nto the affected departments and strengthening control measures and community support.\n\nDengue: The Ministry of Health reports a rise in notification of cases during\nthe last two weeks.\n\nMalaria: According to information from the Ministry, the situation is stable.\n\nCholera: As of 21 November, the Ministry of Health reported three confirmed\ncases of cholera and 11 suspected cases in Regions 1, 3 and 4 of the country.\n\nLeptospirosis: On 20 November, the Ministry of Health reported and outbreak of\nfebrile illness compatible with leptospirosis in three municipalities (San Pedro Zula,\nCholoma and La Lima in the department of Cortes (Region 3). Four cases were reported with\nthree deaths. Two of the cases were serologically confirmed. The Ministry of Health has\nsent an epidemiological team to the field, strengthening the diagnostic capacity and\nimproving epidemiological surveillance efforts.\n\nDengue: As of 21 November, the Ministry reported 1,080 cases of classic dengue,\n444 of which occurred in Region 3. A total of 33 suspected cases of hemorragic dengue have\nbeen analyzed, and 15 of these were confirmed. The remainder are being studied. To date, 4\npeople have died.\n\nCholera: Health authorities report, as of 20 November, an outbreak of cholera en\nSaint Martin Village in the Cayo District, with 11 suspected cases and five confirmed. The\nlatter have been hospitalized in the Belmopan Hospital. In one case, a 78-year-old person\ndied 12 hours after being hospitalized. The suspected source of infection was contaminated\ndrinking water from the Roaring Creek. Fifty-two contacts received treatment.\n\nThe following situations can be identified from available information: \nthere is epidemic activity of cholera in the five countries affected by Hurricane Mitch.\nGuatemala has the highest risk. \nthere is epidemic activity of leptospirosis in Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala. The\narea at greatest risk is Estel\u00ed and Chinandega, Nicaragua. \nthere is epidemic activity of hemorragic dengue in the metropolitan region of Honduras. \n\n\nPAHO recognizes the extraordinary efforts of the local and national health authorities\nin the five countries affected by Hurricane Mitch to control the risk of epidemics. These\nefforts, particularly the improved epidemiological surveillance, have sharply increased\nthe capacity to suspect and detect cases as well as to confirm instances and eventually\ntreat diseases that have the potential to cause epidemics. Consequently, we can expect a\nsignificant increase in the epidemiological reporting of cases in the coming weeks.\n\nHowever, PAHO recommends the immediate establishment of the following measures:\n\nCholera:\n\n1) Strengthen health control measures, including basic hygiene measures, provision of\nsafe water, and handling and consumption of food from street vendors, among the at-risk\npopulation, particularly in shelters.\n\n2) Intensify local epidemiological surveillance measures of cholera (active\nidentification of cases) in the affected population.\n\n3) Implement social communication campaigns particularly in shelters and among the\ndisplaced population and native communities.\n\nLeptospirosis:\n\n1) Strengthen the local capacity to diagnose and quickly treat cases.\n\n2) Stimulate community participation in expanding the application of preventive\nmeasures and the early detection of suspected cases.\n\n3) Step up health surveillance measures, including rodent control.\n\nHemorragic Dengue:\n\n1) Ensure that health authorities have prompt access to suspected cases.\n\n2) Intensify health measures to control vectors.\n\n3) Strengthen local community participation in the control of breeding sites of\nmosquitos.",

While we don't expect catastrophic\noutbreaks, that doesn't mean there will be no cases. Cholera, malaria, dengue and\nleptospirosis are all present in Central America. To control them, we must invest\nsignificant amounts in control of vectors, food, and water supplies.\"\n\nFloods also increase risk of schistosomiasis, dengue, yellow fever, malaria,\nhantavirus, and other diseases, according to PAHO experts. PAHO's Assistant Director, Dr.\nMirta Roses, cited the latest figures on communicable diseases that have been reported to\nPAHO by Ministries of Health, noting that many doctors and epidemiologists are out looking\nfor cases to ensure that any outbreaks are rapidly controlled and the people treated. As a\nresult of this increased attention, reporting is also increased, she said.\n\nEl Salvador has reported six confirmed cases of cholera including one\ndeath, all related to contaminated food sold by street vendors near the border of\nGuatemala.\n\nGuatemala has reported 234 confirmed cholera cases with 17 deaths,\nalong with seven cases of leptospirosis, six cases of dengue, and 70 cases of malaria.\nCholera cases have appeared in different areas of the country, and all have been\nfood-related. Five confirmed cases of leptospirosis have been reported, four in Guatemala\nCity and two in Esquintla.\n\nNicaragua has reported 335 cholera cases and confirmed 301 in\nlaboratories. The cases include 156 in Managua, 46 in Carazo, 25 in Masaya, 18 in\nMatagalpa, 16 in Chinandega, and 13 in Estel\u00ed, with the rest scattered in six other\nareas. Nicaragua has also reported 264 possible leptospirosis cases, of which 42 have been\nconfirmed by laboratory, including 30 in Chinandega, 11 in Estel\u00ed, and one in Madriz.\nSeven people have died from leptospirosis, often transmitted by contact with water\ncontaminated by rodent urine or feces.\n\nHonduras has reported 14 cases of cholera, 4 cases of leptospirosis\nwith three deaths, 1,080 cases of dengue, 15 confirmed cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever\nwith four deaths, and 1,567 cases of malaria, including seven deaths.\n\nBelize has reported a cholera outbreak in Saint Martin Village, with\n11 suspected and five confirmed cases, including one death. The source of infection is\nthought to be contamined water from Roaring Creek, authorities said.\n\nIn all countries, health authorities have taken control measures to improve food safety\nand to guarantee the quality of water for human consumption, and have sent doctors and\nepidemiologists to areas where outbreaks have been reported to take control measures and\neducate the communities on preventive measures, Dr Roses said.\n\nEmergency supplies are arriving and being widely distributed, using the PAHO-designed\nSUMA Humanitarian Supply Management system, Dr. de Ville said, \"but we already see in\nthe field many unusable supplies and expired medicines.\"\n\nThe real problem for Central America will be reconstruction and rehabilitation, Dr. de\nVille said. \"The big item for the health sector in Honduras, for example, is\nreconstruction of the water system, which we estimate will cost some $180 million out of\nan estimated $220 million in health reconstruction costs, and is a very important\npriority.\"\n\nNoting that PAHO has mobilized some 60 experts to the countries hardest hit by the\nhurricane, in addition to the 150 already there, Dr. de Ville said, \"We have a lot to\nlearn from this disaster. Were we sufficiently prepared? Could we have done better? How\ncan we emphasize disaster mitigation to ensure damages will not be so heavy\u00a0 next\ntime?\" He said an evaluation meeting will be held on Hurricanes Mitch and Georges\nFebruary 9th to 12th.\n\nPAHO, founded in 1902, provides technical collaboration in a broad range of fields\nincluding emergency preparedness and disaster relief.

        "Description of the Situation": "23 November 1998 Disease Outbreak Reported\n\nBased on reports from the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), Regional Office\nfor the Americas, WHO\n\nLocal WHO offices in the affected countries have been reinforced by technical personnel\nwith a range of specialities, including environmental sanitation, epidemiological\nsurveillance, food hygiene and vaccination. 31 experts have been sent to Honduras, 19 to\nNicaragua, 4 to Guatemala, 3 to Belize and 2 to El Salvador.\n\nNicaragua. The areas most damaged are along the Pacific coast and in the\nnorthern part of the country. Until now, 2 362 deaths have been confirmed, 970 persons\nhave disappeared and over 55\u00a0000 have been displaced. Major damage has been sustained\nby the infrastructure (roads, water supply and sanitation systems) and by agricultural\nproduction.\n\nReports of suspected cases of cholera in Matalgalpa and Esteli reflect high levels of\nwater contamination and the difficulties associated with chlorine distribution. In\naccessible areas, suspected cases of cholera have been managed in a timely fashion by\nhealth personnel. Although there is a risk of an epidemic outbreak, the situation has so\nfar been under control. Reports on dengue from Leon, Boaco and Rivas do not differ from\nthe annual averages, however there is probably underreporting of cases in the affected\nareas.\n\nOn 13 November 1998, 16 suspected cases of leptospirosis were reported in Chinandega,\nin the community of El Viejo: 8 were hospitalized, 5 have died and 3 have received\nlaboratory confirmation. In addition, 1 suspected case has been reported in Matagalpa, 1\nin Managua and 1 in Esteli.\n\nOf the 8 areas suffering the greatest problems, communication has been reestablished by\nroad in 5. The 3 others can only be reached by air, thus the quantity of drugs, food and\nfuel that can be transported there is limited. Many communities remain isolated in all of\nthe affected areas.\n\nHonduras. The country has been severely affected and losses in human lives,\ninfrastructure and agriculture continue to rise. Earlier estimates of deaths and of\npopulations at risk have been exceeded as health teams reach previously isolated areas.\nCurrently 7 000 deaths have been confirmed, 12 000 people have disappeared and over 500\n000 were estimated to be living in 938 shelters as of 13 November (down from 800 000 in\nthe first 24 hours after the passage of the hurricane).",

        "Description of the Situation": "10 November 1998 Disease Outbreak Reported\n\nHurricane Mitch approached the coast of Honduras on 27 October as a Category V\nhurricane. At that point, and subsequently for a number of days, it stalled off the coast,\nproducing very heavy rainfall. The rains in many countries in Central America, caused\nrivers to overflow and provoked serious mudslides in many areas.\n\nTo date, it has been very difficult to finalize an evaluation of health sector needs\nbecause of conditions in the country. There are no communications within the country.\nTegucigalpa is inaccessible from the north, south and west of the country, making it very\ndifficult for fuel and food to arrive. The roads to the north and to the south are\nseriously damaged. At this writing, more than 5,000 people have lost their lives,\napproximately 1.5 million persons have been affected, 500,000 have been evacuated, an\nestimated 70,000 homes have been damaged. (These figures are conservative.)\n\nThe 50-bed San Lorenzo Hospital was destroyed. The Social Security Hospital is not\nserviceable. The roof of the Roatan Hospital was totally destroyed. Other units of the\nhealth services network suffered considerable damages, and are without electrical energy\nand water supply. A large percentage of health workers are themselves among the affected\nand/or evacuated.\n\nSome of the most pressing needs are for medicines and other critical supplies; vector\ncontrol; adequate collection and treatment of solid waste; rehabilitation of primary\nhealth services; health education and communication; equipment for the San Lorenzo\nHospital; and assessment of the damages and project design for the rehabilitation phase.\n\nThe water distribution system is damaged, and the network needs urgent repair. The\nmajority of surface water outlets have disappeared. In coming weeks, Tegucigalpa will\nsuffer water rationing, and even the areas that can be repaired most quickly will only\nhave water once or twice a week.\n\nNicaragua's National Civil Defense System has provided the following figures (as of 4\nNovember) on the number of people affected by Hurricane Mitch:\n\n\n\nFamilies\nAdults\nChildren\nInjured\nDeaths\nMissing\n\n\n136,930\n405,526\n342,037\n229\n1,368\n1,804\n\n\n\nThe Pacific and northern regions of the country were most affected. In addition to the\nactual and potential loss of life, the principal damages can be summarized as follows: \nIn addition to the widespread threat of vector borne diseases, there is a severe threat\nof diarrhea, respiratory and dermatological diseases. \nMuch of the country's infrastructure was partially or totally destroyed, including 2500\nkm. of roads and more than 80 bridges. \nEnvironmental deterioration, contamination and destruction of basic services such as\nwater supply systems, wells, latrines, as well as an increase in the number of areas which\nhave become a breeding ground for vectors. \nGeneralized overcrowding in shelters designed to accommodate fewer people, with a lack\nof proper waste management services. \n\nEL SALVADOR \n\nThere has been a great deal of damage to infrastructure in this country. The death toll\nis 239 and 60,000 people have been displaced and are being housed in 107 shelters\nthroughout the country.\n\nIn spite of efforts by national authorities to adequately house all of the population\nwho need shelter, health and sanitation conditions may deteriorate in the current\nconditions persist for a lengthy period of time.

        "Description of the Situation": "16 October 1998 Disease Outbreak Reported\n\nThe cholera season in Somalia is now approaching. It is expected to be particularly\ndeadly in Mogadishu this year, owing to the following factors:\n\nThe World Food Programme/Food and Agriculture Organization (WFP/FAO) have estimated the structural food deficit to be quite large. It is expected to result in the additional movement of around 200,000 internally displaced people from Bay and other regions to Mogadishu. These people will be malnourished and obliged to live on the outskirts of Mogadishu without access to safe water.\n\n\nNo international NGO is currently present in Mogadishu. Although Somali professionals have been adequately trained in cholera prevention and treatment, NGO financial support to the staff of cholera treatment centres in the past has greatly contributed to their success in combating the disease. This year, it appears very unlikely that any donor will financially support the staff of these centres.\n\n\nThe United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) has notified termination to many staff in Mogadishu. As a result, their support to chlorination activities in the city is expected to be significantly reduced. However, UNICEF will step up the use of mass media for hygiene awareness and safe water campaigns.\n\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has withdrawn from the Mogadishu area. Its past support to cholera treatment activities in southern Mogadishu was instrumental in preventing many deaths, but it will not be available this season.\n\n\nWHO currently employs a local laboratory technician and two local doctors in Somalia as\npublic health coordinators.\n\nUnless the current security conditions in Mogadishu are improved, the cholera epidemic\nresponse this season will be seriously compromised.",

        "Description of the Situation": "22 September 1998 Disease Outbreak Reported\n\nWHO stresses importance of careful monitoring of Vibrio\ncholerae O139 strain\n\nIn 1992, the world was alarmed by a severe outbreak of cholera in the Bay of Bengal\ncaused by a non-O1 strain of Vibrio cholerae, serogroup O139. The fast spread of\nthis new strain to neighbouring countries and the notification of imported cases in\ndeveloped countries, raised concern as to the possible occurrence of a new pandemic of\ncholera.\n\nVibrio cholerae O139 has been detected since then in 10 countries. This new\nstrain continues to be confined to South-East Asia. In 1998, V. cholerae O139 has\nbeen isolated from 3 patients in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China and 3 in India.\n\nAlthough no major outbreaks have been caused by V. cholerae O139 since 1994, the\nfear that this new strain could become a global threat is still present, particularly in\nAsia, where extremely heavy rainfalls and floods have contributed to an increase in cases\nand deaths due to cholera.\n\nThe WHO Global Cholera Task Force recommends that efforts to monitor the spread of V.\ncholerae O139 at a global level must be continued and/or strengthened.",

Only six\nhospitals in Kabul last week reported 1400 cases of acute severe diarrhoea,\ngastroenteritis, and suspected cholera. This is the third week of the epidemic and more\nemergency medical supplies provided by WHO -Afghanistan have now reached Kabul and\ndistribution is underway.\n\nIn Bamyan from the 19th to the 26th of August 1998, 328 cases of acute severe diarrhoea\nand suspected cholera were reported including 28 deaths of affected men, women, and\nchildren. The civil war in Afghanistan has brought thousands of internally displaced\npeople into the Bamyan area from the North. This overcrowding has further aggravated the\ndangerous situation of water and sanitation. At the same time, the isolation of the area\nmeans that the health facilities have little surplus to respond to the pressure of an\nepidemic. The hospital and clinics in Bamyan have minimal supplies of antibiotics and ORS\nto last until the end of the week. Their supply of intravenous fluid is exhausted and they\nare borrowing from Afghan Red Crescent Society supplies of fluids provided by ICRC for war\nwounded.\n\nIn response to the suspected cholera outbreak, WHO-Afghanistan began shipping emergency\nsupplies to every region of Afghanistan in the middle of August. Supplies for Bamyan were\nwaiting for the next UN flight from Islamabad when the US missile attacks on Afghanistan\noccurred and all flights were suspended. This week WHO is arranging for transfer of\nemergency medical supplies from Ghazni by road. Using the only available land route, the\nsupplies can reach Bamyan no sooner than 3-4 days due to the bad road conditions.\n\nThe long road to Bamyan also crosses two front lines in the civil war. However, since\nthe World Health Organisation has a long-standing reputation as being neutral and\nimpartial and having a good relationship with authorities on either side of the border,\npermit has been granted and their trucks of supplies expect to get through safely.\n\nIn other areas of Afghanistan the outbreak of suspected cholera has continued to claim\nlives -- Baghlan, Laghman, Takhar, Samangan, Kunduz, Badakhshan, Uruzgan and Ghazni. A new\noutbreak of acute gastroenteritis was reported this week from Herat with 86 hospitalized\nand one death. Control of the outbreak depends on providing safe drinking water through\nchlorination or other means and health education about using ORS to treat diarrhoea to\nprevent dehydration. To contain the epidemic and avoid future outbreaks, city-wide and\nnation-wide efforts are required to improve water and sanitation.",

A total of 271 cases have been\nhospitalised with serious complications (aseptic meningitis, encephalitis). Ninety percent\nof deaths and 86% of hospitalised cases were below six years of age.\n\nThe number of hospitalised cases has gradually increased since April 1998, peaked\nduring the period from 24 \u0096 30 May, and thereafter began to decline. Cases have been\nreported from all regions of Taiwan, with the highest number from the Northern Region.\nVarious estimates put the total number of infants and children affected by hand, foot and\nmouth disease between 60,000 and 300,000.\n\nEnteroviruses, in particular EV-71, have been isolated from throat and rectal swabs,\nstools, cerebrospinal fluid and other specimens from fatal and non-fatal cases. Two cases\nwith brain stem encephalitis have been autopsied in Taipei, and EV-71 has been detected in\nbrain stem and spinal cord in one case (8-year-old female), These discoveries have led\nDepartment of Health officials to believe that enterovirus type-71 is implicated.\n\nThe Department of Health in Taiwan formed a special task force to monitor the epidemic\nand to prevent its spread. As there is no vaccine for the virus, the health authorities\nrecommend that parents keep their children away from public places and make sure that\nchildren wash their hands often to reduce the risk of infection.\n\nA Singaporean boy aged two and a half years died on 25 June following hand, foot and\nmouth disease complicated by encephalitis. The boy had no history of travel to Taiwan\nrecently. Laboratory investigation for enteroviruses is being carried out, and the result\nwill be available in one to four weeks. No enterovirus 71 infection has been detected in\nSingapore this year.\n\nRecently reports in the media in Hong Kong have quoted Department of Health sources\nindicating that during the last two weeks of June four cases associated with hand, foot\nand mouth disease were hospitalised, although no deaths were reported. Currently many\ncountries in the region implement heightened surveillance for hand, foot and mouth disease\nand for severe complications in children.",

        "Description of the Situation": "08 June 1998 Disease Outbreak Reported\n\nMany countries/areas in south-east Asia (Malaysia, Taiwan\n[China], Cambodia, Viet Nam, Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia, Myanmar), the western\nPacific (Guam, Cook Islands, Fiji, New Caledonia, Kiribati) and Latin America (Brazil,\nVenezuela, Columbia) have recently been experiencing unusually high levels of\ndengue/dengue haemorrhagic fever activity. Although there is often a seasonal increase in\ndengue in some of these countries/areas at this time of the year, the level of activity in\n1998 is considerably higher than in previous years. Changes in weather patterns as a\nresult of the El Nino phenomenon are thought to be a major contributing factor.\n\nUnless more effective measures are taken to control the main vector, Aedes aegypti,\nin these and other countries/areas, dengue will continue to be a growing problem in\ntropical and subtropical regions of the world. Essential elements of an effective\nprogramme are integrated mosquito control with community and intersectoral involvement,\nvector surveillance for monitoring and evaluation, emergency preparedness, capacity\nbuilding and training, and applied research.\n\nA total of 16,647 cases of dengue/dengue haemorraghic fever with 55 deaths (case\nfatality rate = 0.3%) has been reported since the beginning of 1998. The incidence of\ncases has more than doubled compared with the same period last year. In 1997 the number of\ndengue cases reported (108,000 cases and 245 deaths) was the highest since 1991. As the\ntraditional peak season for dengue (June to November) has only just started a major\nepidemic is expected to occur. While dengue 2 virus was the most prevalent strain in 1997,\nearly data suggests that dengue 3 virus predominates this year, but it should be noted\nthat very few viruses have been typed. Six provinces in southern Viet Nam have been\nprovided with materials for surveillance and testing and all provincial district hospitals\nin the southern region have been supplied with haematocrit equipment for the management of\ncases of dengue haemorrhagic fever.\n\nA total of 5,337 cases (of which 194 were dengue haemorraghic fever) with five deaths\nhas been reported since the beginning of 1998. The number of cases is comparable to the\nnumber reported for the same period last year. The 1997 total of reported cases (19,544\ncases and 50 deaths) was the highest since 1990. As the traditional dengue season only\nbegan in May it is too early to assess the trend during 1998.\n\nThere has been a rapid increase recently in dengue/dengue haemorrhagic fever cases and\nall provinces of the country are now affected. As of 5 May a total of 32,665 cases with\n774 deaths had been reported. This number of cases is considerably higher than in the same\nperiod last year. It is expected that cases will continue to increase during the peak\ntransmission season of May to July. WHO is assisting the Ministry of Health in their\nefforts to control the situation by providing guidelines on clinical management of cases\nand laboratory services during epidemics, sending an expert to assist in developing a\ncontrol strategy, and providing support for laboratory studies.\n\nThis year Brazil is experiencing the highest levels of dengue transmission in its\nhistory. A total of 234,828 cases was reported during the first four months of 1998,\ncompared with 159,965 cases during the same period in 1997 and 254,942 cases reported for\nthe entire year in1997. Transmission appears to have peaked in April, as it did last year.\nThere have been 60 cases of dengue haemorrhagic fever reported and eight deaths. Both\ndengue 1 and dengue 2 viruses are circulating. Approximately 60% of all dengue cases in\nthe Americas are reported from Brazil, but less than 1% of the dengue haemorrhagic fever\ncases. The area with the greatest transmission has been the south-east region, with 89,000\ncases in the State of Minas Gerais and 35,000 cases in the State of Espirito Santo. All\nbut four of the 27 states/territories in Brazil are affected.\n\nIn 1997 Brazil launched its Aedes aegypti Eradication Program. About US$448\nmillions were spent to hire, train and equip tens of thousands of inspectors to visit each\nhouse in infested areas every three months to eliminate breeding sites. Unfortunately, the\ndeployment process has been very slow, because it involves making contracts with each of\nthe 2,500 infested municipalities. At present, inspectors are working in 1,300\nmunicipalities. Emergency measures have included ultra-low-volume application of\ninsecticides with vehicle-mounted sprayers, massive dissemination of information to the\npublic about Aedes breeding sites and how to eliminate them, and plans for aircraft\napplication of insecticide.",

Antibiotic susceptibility testing showed the Sd1 strains were sensitive to\nquinolones and cephalosporines but resistant to antibiotics commonly recommended for\ntreatment of shigella. Shigella dysenteriae type 1, also known as Shiga bacillus, is the\nmost virulent of the four serogroups of Shigella and the only cause of epidemic dysentery.\nIn Africa epidemic dysentery due to Sd1 appeared in eastern Democratic Republic of the\nCongo (former Zaire) in 1979 and has regularly affected more than 15 countries in the\ncontinent.",

        "Description of the Situation": "22 April 1998 Disease Outbreak Reported\n\nDuring 1996 and 1997 many countries in the African meningitis belt experienced severe\nepidemics of meningococcal meningitis with 188,341 cases reported from Africa in 1996 and\n69,518 case in 1997. So far 7,595 cases have been reported from the WHO African Region in\n1998. However not all countries are experiencing this generally reduced level of activity\nand recent weeks have witnessed a large outbreak in Chad. In the period 29th December 1997\nto 22nd of March 1998 there have been 2835 cases and 239 deaths reported from Chad which\nis more than twice the annual total number of cases reported in Chad in 1996 (1,079 cases)\nand 1997 (1,123 cases).\n\nThe district of Bokoro reached the epidemic attack rate of 15 cases/100,000 per week in\nweek 3 (12-18 January) with the capital N'Djamena crossing that threshold in week 8 (16-22\nFebruary). Vaccination campaigns have been carried out in districts where the weekly\nattack rate has exceeded 5 cases/100,000 population. This has resulted in 1,650,000\nvaccinations carried out in 13 of 15 Prefectures. The security stock of meningococcal\nvaccine in place in order to respond to epidemic meningitis has been exhausted and\nadditional vaccine has been supplied through MSF-Belgium and WHO.\n\nThe very real threat of epidemics of cerebrospinal meningitis during the hot dry season\nfrom late December to early May means that the countries of the \"African meningitis\nbelt\" must continue to strengthen surveillance, reporting systems and rapid\nlaboratory confirmation of the etiology. Having a security stock of vaccine is useful but\nearly detection is crucial to mounting a response that can cut short these devastating\nepidemics.",

Of the 19,544 cases, 806 were dengue haemorrhagic fever with 50 deaths. Cases were\nreported throughout the year but peaked in July. Although all the states in the country\nwere affected, most cases were reported in urban areas with high population density.\n\nOf the 5,433 specimens submitted to the WHO Collaborating Centre for Arbovirus\nReference and Research in Kuala Lumpur, for laboratory confirmation 56.5% were positive\nserologically. The male:female ratio was 1.28:1 and the 21-25 years age group was the most\naffected. Of the 100 virus strains isolated, 64 were dengue 1, 33 were dengue 2 and 3 were\ndengue 3.\n\nThe WHO Centre is intensifying its surveillance in 1998 since several factors may\naffect disease patterns. The prolonged drought caused by El Nino may affect vector density\nand the economic downturn has caused a reduction in massive construction which previously\nwas associated with dengue outbreaks. Hopefully, the reduction in the health budget will\nnot adversely affect the dengue situation.\n\nDengue endemic countries in South-East Asia which share problems similar to those of\nMalaysia are advised to monitor the situation closely and submit country data to the WHO\nRegional Offices in Manila and New Delhi on a regular basis.\n\nBased on a report from the WHO Collaborating Centre for Arbovirus Reference and\nResearch, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
