Vibrio cholerae O1 El Tor\nsubtype Ogawa had been confirmed in a 26-year-old male from New Zealand who had visited a\nsmall offshore reef island in Fiji as a tourist in June 1999. He had experienced onset of\nsymptoms on the fourth day of his visit. A similar case in a visitor from New Zealand,\npossibly acquired at the same Fiji island resort, was investigated by the Ministry of\nHealth of Fiji 8 months earlier. No other cases were found at that time.\n\nAfter the second report, the Ministry of Health of Fiji launched a thorough\ninvestigation, in collaboration with WHO. No further cholera cases have been detected, but\nthe investigators did find evidence of faecal contamination of the island's fresh water\nsource (i.e. the groundwater lens) and of the salt water intake for a desalination\nfacility purchased by the resort a few years earlier. Water samples from boreholes that\ndraw from the groundwater lens have revealed the presence of Vibrio parahaemolyticus,\nV. mimicus O36, and V. cholerae O19. Vibrio cholerae O1 has not been\nfound in the water samples taken.\n\nThe island's drinking-water is separately obtained from a rainwater catchment system,\nsupplemented by barged water from outside the island, and supplied to guest rooms in\nplastic jugs. All water sources (borehole, desalinator, rain catchment, and barged water)\nare chlorinated before distribution. Although the borehole and desalinated water is not\nintended for drinking, investigators considered it likely that the infections had occurred\neither by consumption of foods contaminated in the kitchen with inadequately treated\nborehole water, or by inadvertent consumption of the water itself when free residual\nchlorine was absent.\n\nRevised chlorination procedures are currently in place to provide added protection in\nthe short term for residents and visitors. Other measures have already been taken to\nprovide a long-term solution on the affected island. There is no evidence to suggest that\na problem exists in Fiji beyond this small resort island, and Fiji's water supply is\ngenerally considered safe.\n\n\n\nNote: The public health response in this case\nillustrates the usefulness of quick and effective communication between countries. There\nis no risk for travellers to this area in view of the long term measures put into place to\nsolve the problem on this small offshore island.",

These findings indicate widespread transmission of wild poliovirus in\nIraq, where wild poliovirus type 1 was last isolated from a case each in Ninevah and Wasit\ngovernorates with onset in April and May 1997, respectively. The outbreak presents a\nserious challenge to the polio eradication initiative in Iraq, and threatens\nre-introduction of virus in neighbouring countries, especially Islamic Republic of Iran,\nJordan, Syrian Arab Republic and Turkey.\n\nNine of 16 wild-virus confirmed cases (onset May to July)\nbelong to nomadic cattle-herding families, while most cases reported since August are\namong children of resident families. Fourteen of 16 (88%) wild-virus confirmed cases are 2\nyears of age or younger, and 11 of 16 cases (69%) had either no previous oral polio\nvaccine dose (9/16) or were incompletely immunized (2/16).

Two rounds of NIDs will follow\nthese in the spring of 2000. To assure that all children in high-risk populations are\ncovered, existing NID plans at governorate and district level (microplanning) will be\nrevised, where necessary.

He\nencouraged the people to support the chlorination campaign saying, \"lack of hygienic\ndrinking water is the main cause of the emergence of diarrhoea and cholera\".\nAccording to the action plan of the campaign, Kabul City is divided into 28 clusters, each\nwith one supervisor of 3-6 teams. Each team is to chlorinate 20-30 wells per day, handling\nup to 600-900 households during the campaign. The whole process will be thoroughly\nsupervised by a joint team representing MOPH and the aforementioned UN agencies and NGOs.\n\nThe campaign will continue until October 1999 and will include house-to-house field\nvisits by 30 female hygiene educators. The female health educators have been selected from\nthe targeted communities, or have been identified by MOPH to convey health messages to\neach family about family and environmental sanitation and to raise public awareness about\nthe entire sanitation process. School teachers, mullahs, Imams, and mass and print media\nare also fully involved and playing a constructive role in the implementation of this\nlife-saving project.\n\nThe World Food Programme has kindly provided 205 MT of wheat as food for work to\nthis life-saving project and each of the other agencies are providing appropriate support\nin cash and kind.

Following notification of an increase in cholera cases at the\nmain hospital by the chief of the Rumonge health district, a team from M\u00e9decins sans\nfronti\u00e8res and WHO went to the area to investigate and to initiate control measures.\n\nFrom 24 May to 5 June a total of 89 cases with 6 deaths had occurred. No cases have\nbeen reported among the refugees from the Democratic Republic of the Congo who passed\nthrough the area during that period. The cause of the outbreak was probably the early\nonset of the dry season and consequent drinking of water from the lake, as well as lack of\nprevention measures by the population. Action was taken to provide ORS and medicaments as\nwell as clean water by truck. Epidemiological surveillance was also strengthened. A\ncommittee met to mobilise the resources and to coordinate the measures of the aid\nagencies.\n\nA cumulative total of 587 cases had previously been reported in Burundi since the\nbeginning of the year.\u00a0\n\nMadagascar. The cholera outbreak is still continuing in both Mahajanga\nand Antananarivo Provinces. The majority of cases has occurred in several districts of\nMahajanga (3365 cases 215 deaths) since the beginning of the outbreak in March this year\nup to 15 June. A total of 642 cases and 3 deaths occurred in Antananarivo Province up to\nthe same date.\n\nAmericas\n\nHonduras. A cholera outbreak has been reported in areas bordering\nNicaragua and Guatemala. Thirty-two cases have occurred to\ndate, 20 of which (not yet laboratory confirmed) occurred in La Mosquitia area. The health\nauthorities of Honduras, Nicaragua and Guatemala are cooperating to control the disease\nand prevent further spread. Technical cooperation is being provided by the WHO Regional\nOffice for the Americas.\n\nNicaragua. A total of 359 cases with 7 deaths has been reported up to\n5 June. The most affected regions are: Region Autonoma Atlantico Norte (R.A.A.N.),\nManagua, Nueva Segovia and Jinotega.\n\n\u00a0Asia\n\nAfghanistan. A suspected cholera outbreak has been reported in the\nCentral Region which began on 29 May. Three out of 4 samples tested have been laboratory\nconfirmed. In the South-Eastern Region (Ghazni) a suspected cholera outbreak has also been\nreported and an investigation team has been sent to verify the outbreak and to take\nsamples. Medical supplies are needed as well as transport facilities for mobile health\nteams especially for those areas which are difficult to access.\n\nBrunei Darussalam. A cholera outbreak has been reported in Muara\nDistrict by the health authorities in which 72 confirmed cases and 29 suspect cases have\noccurred up to 18 June. Thirty-two of the cases were in an outbreak at a school with date\nof onset mainly on 3 June. No secondary cases have been detected. The source of the\noutbreak has not yet been identified and prevention and control measures are continuing.\n\nNo cholera cases have been reported in Brunei Darussalam since 1982 when 6 cases\noccurred. In 1970 24 cases were reported and in 1965 a larger outbreak with some 198 cases\nwas notified.",

The last case identified occurred on 15 April\n1999. The goal of the Ministry of Health is to vaccinate 100% of the population in the\nendemic yellow fever zones this year.\n\nBrazil: For 1999, the total number of confirmed sylvatic yellow fever cases has\nreached 18, with 3 deaths (case fatality rate of 16.7%). Fifty percent of the cases have\nbeen in persons >15 years old, 44.4% have been in children ages 1-15 years and 5.6%\n(representing one case) have been in children <1 year of age. Most of the cases have\noccurred in males (72.2%). The outbreak seems to be concentrated in two\nmunicipalities\u0097 Afu\u00e1 and Breves, in the State of Para. Reports from Brazil show that\nmany of the cases from Afu\u00e1 were identified through active surveillance and serological\nsurveys after a death due to yellow fever occurred in February 1999.\n\nAlthough a vaccination campaign was carried out in Afu\u00e1 achieving 100% coverage, cases\ncontinue to occur due to the migration of unimmunized people into the area. Families are\nmigrating to this area for work, primarily harvesting heart of palm. In the process of\nharvesting the trees, the habitat of the mosquitoes is disrupted and contact with humans,\nincluding unimmunized young children, occurs.\n\nColombia: To date in 1999, the total number of confirmed sylvatic cases is two and\nboth cases were fatal. These two cases were in males, ages 17 and 21 years. The cases\noccurred in the Departments of Caqueta and Meta. No cases have been reported since\nJanuary.\n\nPeru: The first confirmed case of sylvatic yellow fever for 1999 was reported in a\n25 year old male from the department of Loreto, Amazon region who died on 7 April. In\nresponse to this case, mass yellow fever vaccination was initiated in the area. Other\ncases have occurred in San Martin Department, in the districts of Moyobamba, Jepelacio and\nAlonso de Alvarado (26 cases), Ayacucho Department in the province of La Mar, district of\nAnco y Santa Rosa (12 cases), Huanuco Department (5 cases) and Junin Department (5 cases).\nOf these a total of 13 cases have been confirmed to date.",

Samples from four other suspected cases were negative.\nInvestigations will be initiated to establish whether Marburg fever was responsible for an\nestimated 76 cases of hemorrhagic fever (52 deaths) that have been reported in Watsa and a\nnearby community of Durba. Most of the cases were gold miners working in mines near Durba.\nEpidemiological experts from WHO Headquarters, the WHO\u00a0 Regional Office for Africa\nand WHO country offices in Kinshasa, DRC and Kampala, Uganda are joining the M\u00e9decins\nsans fronti\u00e8res (MSF Belgium and MSF Netherlands) team already in the area. Experts\nfrom the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and from the Institut Pasteur are\nalso expected to arrive in the DRC within several days to join the investigation to\ndetermine the current size of the outbreak and further investigate the aetiology of the\nepidemic. The team will also provide technical assistance to further implement control\nmeasures. MSF is establishing a ward to isolate patients and training local healthcare\nstaff to use barrier nursing procedures and protective equipment.\n\nMarburg virus infections, a lethal relative of Ebola (both viruses are\nin the Filovirus family), are found in sub-Saharan Africa and occur infrequently.\nSince the virus was first recognized in 1967 when laboratory workers in Marburg, Germany\nand Belgrade, Yugoslavia were infected by handling monkeys and monkey tissues from animals\nimported from Uganda, there have only been\u00a0 three reports of sporadic cases (1975 in\nZimbabwe and South Africa, and in 1980 and 1987 in Kenya). The virus is transmitted to\npeople following contact with infected animals and animal tissues, and from\nperson-to-person by close contact with infected patients and body fluids. The natural\nreservoirs of Marburg virus and of Ebola virus are unknown.\n\nBoth the Marburg and Ebola viruses are often characterized by the sudden onset of\nfever, malaise, muscle pain, headache and conjunctivitis. This is followed by sore throat,\nvomiting, diarrhoea, rash, and both internal and external bleeding. Liver function may be\nabnormal and platelet function may be impaired. No specific treatment or vaccine exists\nfor Marburg disease. Severe cases require intensive supportive care, as patients are\nfrequently dehydrated and in need of intravenous fluids. Experimental studies involving\nthe use of hyperimmune sera on animals demonstrated no long-term protection against the\ndisease after interruption of therapy.\n\nSuspected cases should be isolated from other patients and strict\nbarrier nursing techniques practised. All hospital personnel should be briefed on the\nnature of the disease and its routes of transmission. Particular emphasis should be placed\non ensuring that high-risk procedures such as the placing of intravenous lines and the\nhandling of blood, secretions, catheters and suction devices are done under barrier\nnursing conditions. Hospital staff should have individual gowns, gloves and masks. Gloves\nand masks must not be reused unless disinfected. Patients who die from the disease should\nbe promptly buried or cremated.\n\nPlease see previous reports about this outbreak:\u00a0 5 May 1999; 30 April 1999.",

        "Description of the Situation": "05 May 1999 Disease Outbreak Reported\n\nAn outbreak has been reported in the Watsa zone, in the northeastern part of the\ncountry. Clinical features include fever, severe headache, lassitude, gastrointestinal\nbleeding and agitation, but according to the health care workers who have looked after\nmany of the patients, haemorrhagic features are not the norm. Death has generally occurred\n5-6 days after onset. The first cases are believed to have taken place in January 1999,\nhowever there are indications that since 1994, there have been multiple small outbreaks of\napparently similar illness in the vicinity of Durba, hence the locally-used description of\n\"Durba syndrome\". Durba, the site of pit gold-mining operations, is situated\nabout 20 km from Watsa. Up to 3 May, 68 cases have been recorded, with 63 deaths\n(case-fatality rate 93%). Most of the cases have occurred in gold miners, and a few in the\ngeneral community. The chief medical officer of the zone was among the fatalities, but it\nseems that secondary spread to family contacts or health care workers has been a rare\nevent.\n\nStaff from the WHO Regional Office for Africa and a joint team from M\u00e9decins sans\nfronti\u00e8res (Belgium and the Netherlands) have arrived in the area. Clinical samples\ncollected from 5 patients have been sent to a reference laboratory for diagnostic testing\nand an epidemiological investigation is under way. An isolation unit has been set up in\nDurba, and local health care personnel are being instructed in preventive and protective\nmeasures, as well as in case management. This report is preliminary, and updated\ninformation will be provided as soon as it becomes available.",

        "Description of the Situation": "29 March 1999 Disease Outbreak Reported\n\nOn 26 March, authorities in Hong Kong SAR reported that an H5 virus was\nisolated on 10 March from cage swabs taken in the city's western wholesale poultry\nmarket, from a stall dealing only with imported waterfowl. It has not caused any illness\nin poultry in the market. The virus was immediately sent to local and international\nlaboratories for further characterization. Even though the virus has the same\nhaemaglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) subtype, it was found to be genetically distinct\nfrom the H5N1 virus found in 1997.\n\nLocal health officers visited the market following the incident and\nfound that no workers reported any illness. Waterfowl are natural carriers of various\ninfluenza viruses, so that isolation of an H5 virus is not unusual and poses no public\nhealth risk on this occasion.\n\nImport control and environmental monitoring of the market have taken\nplace regularly since the importation of birds resumed in early 1998. This is the first\ntime an H5 virus has been isolated. There is no evidence of infection with H5 virus in\nother poultry, nor in local farms. The supply of birds to Hong Kong SAR from any farm\nshowing signs of infection will be suspended.",

Other villages were visited by M\u00e9decins\nsans fronti\u00e8res and Focus (Aga Khan Foundation).\n\nThe outbreak began around mid-January after 2 young men returned from the village of\nWaram, both suffering from an acute respiratory infection. Over the next 2 days,\napproximately 40 persons living in the same household became ill. The disease then spread\nthrough the whole village, affecting 70%-80% of households. The village has a population\nof 5\u00a0400. The deaths occurred among both males and females and involved primarily\ninfants and the elderly. The most recent case was reported on 26 February. Cases were\ntreated by the team with chloramphenicol, which resulted in a significant improvement,\nsuggesting that severely ill patients were suffering from secondary bacterial infections.\nThere were no deaths among those treated.\n\nThe disease is flu-like and is characterized by abrupt onset of fever, headaches and\nmyalgia, followed by chest pain and cough. Living and sanitary conditions are crowded, and\nthe water supply is unprotected. Nutrition is of poor quality. There are no health\nservices in this very remote area, which has not been accessed by routine immunization\nteams.\n\nPreliminary conclusions of the WHO team in the field is that the outbreak now declining\nwas an influenza-like illness which has affected a large proportion of the population. The\nrate of secondary complications (mainly pneumonia) was high. Mortality is 1%-2% of the\ntotal population primarily due to lack of antibiotic availability and overall poor living\nand nutritional conditions.\n\nWHO and its local partners are now helping local authorities to organize follow-up\ntreatment and arranging for additional medical supplies to the area. Clinical specimens\ncollected by the field team will be analysed shortly.",

Three associated human cases have also been reported, all with a benign\nfebrile illness.\n\nTowards the end of January, six pregnant buffalo were observed to abort, and, shortly\nafter, 3 giraffes and 1 waterbuck were found dead without obvious signs of predator\nattack. Three veterinarians in contact with tissues from these animals developed an\nuncomplicated, febrile illness. Deaths among goat kids in adjacent areas have also been\nrecorded.

Mosquito control measures\nhave been increased in tourist destinations. However, most human cases of RVF reported in\nthe past from South Africa were acquired through contact with diseased animals and their\ntissues, rather than through mosquito bites, so the general public is not perceived to be\nat particular risk of contracting the illness.\n\nLarge outbreaks of RVF occurred in South Africa's inland plateau in 1974-76, and a\nsmall outbreak was recorded in 1981 in a coastal area of KwaZulu-Natal, but no disease\nactivity has been detected in the intervening period. Several consecutive years with high\nrainfall have favoured the explosion of the Aedes mosquito population which is the\nvector for the virus.",
