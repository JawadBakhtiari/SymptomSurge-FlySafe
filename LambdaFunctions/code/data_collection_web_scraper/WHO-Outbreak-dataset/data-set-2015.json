        "Description of the Situation": "On 14 December 2015, the National IHR Focal Point (NFP) of Panama notified PAHO/WHO of one (1) additional laboratory-confirmed case of Zika virus infection.As of 17 December, 4 cases of Zika virus had been confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). All laboratory-confirmed cases of Zika virus infection are female ranging in age between 25 and 59 years.A total of 95 suspected cases, with symptoms compatible with Zika virus infection, have also been reported in the Ustupu and Ogobsugun islands, Guna Yala province. Of the 95 suspected cases, 4 tested positive for dengue virus by RT-PCR. The first case of dengue was confirmed approximately two weeks prior to the confirmation of Zika virus infection. This indicates co-circulation of the two viruses in the same community. Of the remaining 91 suspected cases, 30 were negative for both dengue and chikungunya. Suspected cases are distributed across all ages, with the highest number concentrated in the age group 25-34. Women account for the majority of cases (66%).",

        "Public Health Response": "Panamanian health authorities are implementing various public health measures:carrying out information, education and communication activities \u2013 e.g., leaflets in three languages (Guna, Spanish and English) have been developed and distributed;conducting vector control activities.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "",
        "WHO Advice": "The proximity of mosquito vector breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for Zika virus infection. Prevention and control relies on reducing the breeding of mosquitoes through source reduction (removal and modification of breeding sites) and reducing contact between mosquitoes and people. This can be achieved by reducing the number of natural and artificial water-filled habitats that support mosquito larvae, reducing the adult mosquito populations around at-risk communities and by using barriers such as insect screens, closed doors and windows, long clothing and repellents. Since the Aedes mosquitoes (the primary vector for transmission) are day-biting mosquitoes, it is recommended that those who sleep during the daytime, particularly young children, the sick or elderly, should rest under mosquito nets (bed nets), treated with or without insecticide to provide protection. Mosquito coils or other insecticide vaporizers may also reduce the likelihood of being bitten.During outbreaks, space spraying of insecticides may be carried out following the technical orientation provided by WHO to kill flying mosquitoes. Suitable insecticides (recommended by the WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme) may also be used as larvicides to treat relatively large water containers, when this is technically indicated.Basic precautions for protection from mosquito bites should be taken by people traveling to high-risk areas, especially pregnant women. These include use of repellents, wearing light-colored, long-sleeved shirts and pants and ensuring rooms are fitted with screens to prevent mosquitoes from entering.WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction to Panama based on the current information available.",

        "Description of the Situation": "On 11 December 2015, the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) of China notified WHO of 2 additional laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A (H7N9) virus.Details of the casesThe first case is a 74-year-old male from Meizhou City, Guangdong Province, with onset date of 19 November. He purchased poultry from a market and raised poultry at home. At the time of report, the case was in severe condition.The second case is a 60-year-old male from Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province, with onset date of 20 November. He has a history of slaughtering domestic poultry. At the time of report, the case was in severe condition.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "The Chinese Government has taken the following surveillance and control measuresstrengthening outbreak surveillance and situation analysis;reinforcing all efforts on medical treatment; andconducting risk communication with the public and dissemination of information.WHO is assessing the epidemiological situation and conducting further risk assessment based on the latest information. Based on the information received thus far, the overall public health risk from avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses has not changed.If the pattern of human cases follows the trends seen in previous years, the number of human cases may rise over the coming months. Further sporadic cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus are expected in affected and possibly in the neighboring areas. Should human cases from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during travels or after arrival. If this were to occur, community level spread is considered unlikely as the virus has not demonstrated the ability to transmit easily among humans.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO advises that travelers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid poultry farms, or contact with animals in live bird markets, or entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travellers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, in order to ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005), and continue national health preparedness actions.",

        "WHO Advice": "Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS\u2010CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.WHO remains vigilant and is monitoring the situation. Given the lack of evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission in the community, WHO does not recommend travel or trade restrictions with regard to this event. Raising awareness about MERS-CoV among travellers to and from affected countries is good public health practice.",

Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS\u2010CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.WHO remains vigilant and is monitoring the situation. Given the lack of evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission in the community, WHO does not recommend travel or trade restrictions with regard to this event. Raising awareness about MERS-CoV among travellers to and from affected countries is good public health practice.* Updated on 3 December 2015. The age was corrected from 54 to 57 years old.",

Patients developed fever, headache, general body aches and abdominal pain with occasional vomiting and/or diarrhea but experienced no further complications or fatalities. They have been responding to the given medical care. Some of the cases come from the same household. Several samples including oropharyngeal swabs, blood and serum samples were collected. A total of 28 out of the 118 serum samples were positive for Dengue virus type I by ELISA and PCR at the Central Public Health Laboratories.

A training workshop was conducted for all health care workers to enhance their capacity for the early detection and prompt management of cases. Surveillance is ongoing in the surrounding villages and districts for early detection of cases.Entomological surveillance revealed the presence of Aedes aegypti larvae and adult mosquito at the sites where cases are living; consequently, entomological control measures for dengue vector were immediately set up. So far, these measures have resulted in a dramatic decline in the density of adult mosquito (from 23% to 0%) and larvae (from 25% to 0.5%). Entomological surveillance and vector control measures continue to be implemented in the affected villages and its surrounding areas.",

As of 8 October, autochthonous cases of Zika virus had been detected in 14 states: Alagoas, Bahia, Cear\u00e1, Maranh\u00e3o, Mato Grosso, Par\u00e1, Paran\u00e1, Para\u00edba, Pernambuco, Piau\u00ed, Rio de Janeiro, Rio Grande do Norte, Roraima, and S\u00e3o Paulo.Public health measures implemented by national and state authorities include the development and dissemination of sentinel protocol for Zika virus surveillance, development and validation of protocol for surveillance of neurological syndromes, and vector control activities.ColombiaAs of 16 October, 9 samples were laboratory-confirmed as Zika virus infections out of 98 samples from the Bol\u00edvar department (13 from Cartagena and 85 from Turbaco). These are the first cases of Zika virus infection detected in the country.BackgroundZika fever is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by Zika virus, consisting of mild fever, rash (mostly maculo-papular), headaches, arthralgia, myalgia, asthenia, and non-purulent conjunctivitis, occurring about three to twelve days after the mosquito vector bite. One out of four people may not develop symptoms, but in those who are affected the disease is usually mild with symptoms that can last between two and seven days. Its clinical manifestation is often similar to dengue, also a mosquito-borne illness.Since 2014, indigenous circulation of Zika virus has been detected in the Americas. In February 2014, the public health authorities of Chile confirmed the first case of indigenous transmission of Zika virus infection on Easter Island, and cases were reported until June 2014. Recent outbreaks of Zika virus fever in different regions of the world demonstrate the potential for the arbovirus to spread through territories where the (Aedes) vector is found.",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 14 October 2015, the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) of China notified WHO of 2 additional laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A (H7N9) virus.Details of the casesThe cases are a 55-year-old female and a 53-year-old male, with onset dates of 18 September and 21 September, respectively. Both cases had exposure to poultry and live poultry markets. No epidemiological link between the cases was reported. The cases were reported from 2 municipalities (Huzhou city and Jinhua city) in Zhejiang province.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "The Chinese Government has taken the following surveillance and control measures:strengthen outbreak surveillance and situation analysis;reinforce all efforts on medical treatment; andconduct risk communication with the public and dissemination of information.WHO is assessing the epidemiological situation and conducting further risk assessment based on the latest information. Based on the information received thus far, the overall public health risk from avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses has not changed.As of June 2015, FAO reported continued AI A(H7N9) virus detections in the animal population in multiple provinces in China, indicating that the virus persists in the poultry population. If the pattern of human cases follows the trends seen in previous years, the human case number may rise over the coming months. Further sporadic cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus are expected in affected and possibly neighboring areas. Should human cases from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during or after arrival. If this were to occur, community level spread is considered unlikely as the virus has not demonstrated the ability to transmit easily among humans.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid poultry farms, or contact with animals in live bird markets, or entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travellers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, in order to ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005), and continue national health preparedness actions.",

        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "The Cholera task force led by the Ministry of Health (MoH) has established a Cholera Command and Control Centre to enhance multisectoral coordination for effective response to the outbreak. In the affected governorates, active surveillance has been stepped up for case findings in the community and case management has been standardized across all health facilities currently admitting the cholera cases.In cholera affected areas, and particularly in the camps hosting the internally displaced people and refugees, preparedness activities have been geared up as well. These include distribution of bottled water, water kits, hygiene kits, bleaching powder and chlorine tablets; establishment of water distribution points; sanitation activities, such as disinfecting septic tanks at health facilities, conducting targeted sanitation improvements including for the water treatment plant, as well as regular cleaning of latrines and bathing facilities and proper solid waste collection, disposal and management; and dissemination of key messages on cholera prevention through several networks including social media, national radio channels, SMS messages and door to door campaigns.Furthermore, discussions are ongoing with the International Coordinating Group to release oral cholera vaccine from the global stock. A risk assessment to identify priority groups for vaccination and a vaccination plan is being developed.WHO has deployed a team of international experts under the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) to support MoH respond to this outbreak. Additional requests have also been sent out to the technical partners in GOARN in case of request for additional international support for cholera response.",

Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.Food hygiene practices should be observed.

        "Description of the Situation": "On 14 September 2015, the National IHR Focal Point for Portugal notified WHO of a confirmed human case of West Nile virus (WNV) infection. The patient is a 71-year-old male from the town of Almancil (Loul\u00e9 municipality) \u2013 Algarve Region, Portugal with no recent history of travel. On 20 July, he was hospitalized with neurological symptoms. Following a full recovery, on 4 August, the patient was discharged from hospital.Seroconversion (IgM and IgG) was confirmed in two separate samples on 7 and 19 August. Real-time PCR was negative in the first sample. Neutralization tests were positive for WNV on samples collected on 14 September.Even though the presence of WNV is known in Portugal, where three previous probable human cases were reported (two in 2004 and one in 2010), this is the first laboratory-confirmed human case that fully meets the European Union case definition for WNV.",
        "Epidemiology": "West Nile virus is a member of the flavivirus genus and belongs to the Japanese encephalitis antigenic complex of the family Flaviviridae. The virus is commonly found in Africa, Europe, the Middle East, North America and West Asia. WNV is mainly transmitted to people through the bites of infected mosquitoes. Humans, horses and other mammals can all be infected. Infection with the virus can cause neurological disease and death in people. Vaccines are available for use in horses but not yet available for people.",
        "Public Health Response": "Regional and local health authorities performed the necessary epidemiological, serological and clinical investigations. The Directorate-General for Food and Veterinary at the local and regional levels performed the epidemiological, serological and clinical investigations in the animals of the area.On 3 September, Portuguese national authorities informed the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) of three foci of WNV infection in equines in the municipalities of Faro and Loul\u00e9 \u2013 Algarve region.The Portuguese National authorities also implemented the following preventive measures:issued a national-level press release for the general public and health professionals;took actions aimed at ensuring safety of blood, blood components and transplantations;delivered a blood alert notification;set up mosquito control actions.",

A second sample taken on 19 August showed an IgG seroconversion at the same laboratory. Samples were then sent for further testing to the Institute of Health Carlos III, the national reference laboratory (NRL). ELISA results at the NRL were inconclusive both for IgM and IgG on the sample taken on 23 July. These results were not confirmed neither by indirect immunofluorescence nor neutralization tests. Samples taken on 19 August were negative. Further tests carried out at the NRL showed a positive ELISA result for IgM against Parvovirus B19 in the sample taken on 23 July that turned negative in the sample taken on 19 August, suggesting a possible recent past parvovirus infection, which could explain the symptoms experienced by the patient.",

        "Description of the Situation": "On 9 September 2015, the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs (MOHSA) of Senegal notified WHO of active circulation of chikungunya virus in the region of K\u00e9dougou. The circulation began on 27 August 2015. Samples were collected from 14 suspected cases for laboratory-confirmation at the Institut Pasteur of Dakar. Ten (10) samples tested positive for chikungunya virus. As of 8 September 2015, ten (10) chikungunya confirmed cases were reported. The latest active circulation in the affected area was reported between 2009 and 2010.",
        "Epidemiology": "Chikungunya is a viral disease transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes. It causes fever and severe joint pain. Other symptoms include muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue and rash. Joint pain is often debilitating and can vary in duration. The disease shares some clinical signs with dengue, and can be misdiagnosed in areas where dengue is common. There is no cure for the disease. Treatment is focused on relieving the symptoms. The proximity of mosquito breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for chikungunya. The disease occurs in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Indian subcontinent. Senegal was affected by the disease in 2009.",
        "Public Health Response": "On 7 September 2015, the MOHSA discussed the situation during the routine weekly meeting. The meeting provided technical directives to the different teams and departments involved in the response. The overall coordination of the response will be led by the MOHSA\u2019s Preventive department with the support of WHO and partners.Official declaration of this public health event was made by the MOHSA through press release. Control actions that are being implemented include case management, distribution of technical documents on the disease to all health centres in the country and reinforcement of the epidemiological surveillance. Social mobilization is ongoing in the affected region and in all the other regions. The deployment of a multidisciplinary team of experts is under preparation. The team will conduct a sero-entomo-epidemiological investigation and provide technical support for surveillance and vector control activities.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO recommends protective measures against mosquito bites, vector control activities targeting major breeding sites of mosquitoes, community-based surveillance and social mobilization to avoid misconceptions and false rumours.WHO does not recommend any trade or travel restriction to Senegal based on the information available on the current active circulation of the chikungunya virus.",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "The Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW) of Tanzania has notified WHO of foci of cholera outbreaks in the country. Rorya district in the Mara region of Tanzania was the first area to report a cholera outbreak. By late July 2015, the Kigoma region also became affected \u2013 although no new case has been recorded in this area in more than three weeks. On 25 August, new foci of cholera were identified in Dar es Salaam, Pwani (Coast), Iringa and Morogoro. The cholera outbreak in the Dar es Salaam region began on 15 August, whilst the outbreak in the Morogoro region started on 18 August. As of 6 September, the cumulative number of cholera cases (both suspected and confirmed) is 971 cases, including 13 deaths. Laboratory tests confirmed the presence of Vibrio cholerae O1 Ogawa in the affected areas.",
        "Epidemiology": "Cholera is a diarrhoeal disease caused by Vibrio cholerae. Cholera outbreaks are recurrent in many African countries and are linked to poor hygiene and sanitation as well as insufficient preparedness and capacities. Tanzania has experienced cholera outbreaks in the past, with the Kigoma region being the most affected. This year, the country developed a long-term plan for cholera prevention and control.Cholera is predictable and preventable, and can ultimately be eliminated where access to clean water and sanitation facilities, and satisfactory hygienic conditions are ensured and sustained for the whole population. Effective cholera prevention and control interventions rely primarily on the implementation of integrated multidisciplinary and comprehensive approaches that involve activities outside the health sector and that address several elements, including environmental living conditions, access to treatment and clinical management of cases, vaccination with Oral Cholera Vaccines, social mobilization of communities and epidemiological surveillance.",
        "Public Health Response": "Rapid assessment has been conducted to identify gaps and urgent needs. Regional authorities, the MOHSW, WHO and partners are holding bi-weekly meetings to coordinate the response efforts. A national task force has been activated to control the outbreak. With support from WHO and partners, five treatment centres have been established in Dar es Salaam and Morogoro to manage cases. The MOHSW has deployed technical experts to provide assistance with surveillance activities including case finding, water supply and sanitation monitoring, laboratory management and social mobilization interventions.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction to Tanzania based on the current information available.",

        "WHO Risk Assessment": "",
        "WHO Advice": "Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS\u2010CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.WHO remains vigilant and is monitoring the situation. Given the lack of evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission in the community, WHO does not recommend travel or trade restrictions with regard to this event. Raising awareness about MERS-CoV among travellers to and from affected countries is good public health practice.Public health authorities in host countries preparing for mass gatherings should ensure that all recommendations and guidance issued by WHO with respect to MERS-CoV have been appropriately taken into consideration and made accessible to all concerned officials. Public health authorities should plan for surge capacity to ensure that visitors during the mass gathering can be accommodated by health systems.",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "The Ministry of Health of Madagascar has notified WHO of an outbreak of plague. The first case was identified on 17 August in a rural township in Moramanga district. The case passed away on 19 August. As of 30 August, 14 cases, including 10 deaths, were reported. All confirmed cases are of the pneumonic form. Since 27 August, no new cases have been reported from the affected or neighbouring districts.",
        "Epidemiology": "Plague is a bacterial disease caused by Yersinia pestis, which primarily affects wild rodents. It is spread from one rodent to another by fleas. Humans bitten by an infected flea usually develop a bubonic form of plague, which produces the characteristic plague bubo (a swelling of the lymph node). If the bacteria reach the lungs, the patient develops pneumonia (pneumonic plague), which is then transmissible from person to person through infected droplets spread by coughing. If diagnosed early, bubonic plague can be successfully treated with antibiotics. Pneumonic plague, on the other hand, is one of the most deadly infectious diseases; patients can die 24 hours after infection. The mortality rate depends on how soon treatment is started, but is always very high.The current outbreak follows another plague outbreak that occurred in Madagascar between 2014 and 2015, with a peak in November 2014 when over 335 cases and 79 deaths were reported.",
        "Public Health Response": "The national task force has been activated to manage the outbreak. With support from partners \u2013 including WHO and the Pasteur Institute of Madagascar \u2013 the government of Madagascar is implementing thorough public health measures, including active case and contact finding, provision of chemoprophylaxis, case and contact management, enhanced epidemiologic surveillance, infection prevention and control (house disinfection), vector control activities, social mobilization, coordination and resource mobilization.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction based on the current information available. In urban areas, such as Antananarivo, the surveillance of epidemic risk indicators is highly recommended for the implementation of preventive vector control activities.",

        "WHO Advice": "Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS\u2010CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.WHO remains vigilant and is monitoring the situation. Given the lack of evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission in the community, WHO does not recommend travel or trade restrictions with regard to this event. Raising awareness about MERS-CoV among travellers to and from affected countries is good public health practice.Public health authorities in host countries preparing for mass gatherings should ensure that all recommendations and guidance issued by WHO with respect to MERS-CoV have been appropriately taken into consideration and made accessible to all concerned officials. Public health authorities should plan for surge capacity to ensure that visitors during the mass gathering can be accommodated by health systems.",

An international team comprising experts from WHO and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was deployed to support the Ministry of Public Health in carrying out epidemiological investigations and strengthening the national surveillance capacity.Together with its partners, WHO assisted the government of Niger in the implementation of mass vaccination campaigns and other emergency control measures. The International Coordinating Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision for Epidemic Meningitis Control approved four vaccination requests and released 965,000 doses of multivalent C and W containing polysaccharide vaccine and, 200,000 doses of ACYW conjugate vaccine. Furthermore, the government of Niger obtained 200,000 doses of polysaccharide ACWY vaccine from the government of Mali.In addition to mass immunization campaigns and enhanced surveillance, social mobilization and case management activities were performed in all affected areas. These measures led to the control of the outbreak. Currently, all districts are below the epidemic threshold.",

Overall, the public health risk from avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses has not changed.Comparing with the previous two months, the infection case number is decreasing. Further sporadic human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) infection are expected in affected and possibly neighboring areas. Should human cases from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during or after arrival.

Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travellers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, in order to ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005), and continue national health preparedness actions.",

Between 10 and 18 June, he travelled to Saudi Arabia and stayed in Riyadh, Jeddah and Dammam. The patient had cough before travelling to Saudi Arabia; however, while in Saudi Arabia, he did not feel unwell and did not seek medical attention. Investigation of history of exposure to known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms is ongoing.On June 18, the patient left Saudi Arabia, stayed overnight in Dubai, United Arab Emirates and travelled to Manila, Philippines on June 19. He was asymptomatic when he left Saudi Arabia. From 20 to 22 June, the patient was in the areas of Taguig and Makati in Manila. Between 23 and 24 June, he travelled from Manila to Penang, Malaysia via Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. On 25 June, the patient travelled from Penang, Malaysia to Singapore and from Singapore to Manila. During his travels from Malaysia to Singapore and back to Manila, he was asymptomatic. On June 30, the patient developed fever and cough and on 2 July he visited a hospital where he had specimens taken for laboratory testing. Against medical advice, he decided to leave the hospital. The patient stayed home on 3 July. On 4 July, he returned to the hospital to obtain the results of the tests but the clinic was closed. Then, the patient went to another hospital where he was seen by health care professionals. Once the patient tested positive for MERS-CoV on 4 July, he was brought by ambulance to a third hospital and placed in isolation. Currently, the patient is afebrile and remains in stable condition.Global situationGlobally, since September 2012, WHO has been notified of 1,368 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 487 related deaths. *",

However, the infant's viral genotype was confirmed as H1; this virological evidence may relate cases 1 and 2 as part of the same chain of transmission.A 38-year-old male from Santiago developed symptoms on 1 June, within the incubation period of case 1. As with case 2, H1 viral genotype was determined.A 44-year-old male health care worker from the municipality of Las Condes in Santiago developed symptoms on 3 June and tested positive for measles on 6 June. The patient was admitted to hospital, and currently is recovering at home. A 21-year-old male, relative of the second case, developed symptoms on 4 June and tested positive for measles on 10 May.",

        "Public Health Response": "Public health measures have focused on alerting public and private networks along side intensifying surveillance to ensure timely investigation of cases. All identified suspected case contacts are being immediately vaccinated (without waiting for laboratory confirmation) while vaccination of children is being strengthened. The objective is to interrupt the chain of transmission.In relation to \u201cCopa America Chile 2015\u201d, which is being hosted in Chile from 11 June to 4 July, the health authorities of Chile and the Pan American Health Organization have recommended travelers to the country to make sure that they are up-to-date with vaccinations for measles or to be vaccinated two weeks before departure.",

        "Description of the Situation": "Between 8 and 12 June 2015, the National IHR Focal Point of the Republic of Korea notified WHO of 62 additional confirmed cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), including 6 deaths.Additional information on the outbreak in the Republic of Korea To date, a total of 126 MERS-CoV cases, including 11 deaths, have been reported. One of the 126 cases is the case that was confirmed in China and also notified by the National IHR Focal Point of China. The median age of the patients is 56 years old (ranging from 16 to 84 years old). The majority of cases are men (59%). Ten cases (7.9%) are health care professionals. To date, all cases have been linked to a single chain of transmission and are associated with health care facilities (excluding the index case). So far, authorities have identified 44 hospitals where either transmission occurred or a confirmed MERS patient visited before diagnostic confirmation. Scientists in Korea and China have completed full genome sequencing of coronaviruses from the current outbreak. Findings were analysed by a group of virologists convened by WHO. Preliminary analysis of these findings does not suggest that a more transmissible virus is emerging in Korea. An explanation for the rapid expansion of Korea\u2019s outbreak almost certainly lies elsewhere.Global situationGlobally, since September 2012, WHO has been notified of 1289 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 455 related deaths.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "National authorities are implementing containment strategy which consists in early detection of cases, early isolation and contact tracing. As of 12 June 2015, 3,680 contacts have been identified (3,453 are under home monitoring and 227 under facility monitoring) and 1,249 contacts have been released.The large number of contacts currently being monitored makes the detection of at least some further cases inevitable.In addition, on 10 June, public health authorities in Korea carried out a MERS-CoV screening day in about 3,000 health care facilities to proactively detect cases.A joint Korea-WHO high level mission is currently ongoing to gain information and review the situation in the Republic of Korea including the epidemiological pattern, the characteristic of the virus and clinical features. The team will also assess the public health response efforts and provide recommendations for response measures going forward. The joint mission ends on 13 June 2015.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "",
        "WHO Advice": "Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because, like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS\u2010CoV infection. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing, should be adhered to.WHO remains vigilant and is monitoring the situation. Given the lack of evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission in the community, WHO does not advise special procedures at points of entry, or travel or trade restrictions with regard to this event.Starting from 12 June 2015, Disease Outbreak News concerning MERS-CoV in the Republic of Korea will be published on a bi-weekly basis (on Tuesdays and Fridays).",

It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS\u2010CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.Food hygiene practices should be observed.

On 21 May, two additional confirmed cases were reported.Details of the cases are as follows:The first case is a 68 year-old male with the following travel history: 18-29 April, Bahrain; 29-30 April, United Arab Emirates; 30 April to 1 May, Bahrain; 1-2 May, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia; 2 May, Bahrain; and 2-3 May, Qatar. The patient arrived at Korea\u2019s Incheon International airport via Qatar on 4 May. He was asymptomatic on arrival. The patient developed symptoms on 11 May and sought medical care at a clinic from 12 May to 15 May on an outpatient basis. He was then admitted to hospital on 15 May and discharged on 17 May. On the evening of discharge, the patient visited the emergency department of another hospital. A sputum sample tested positive for MERS-CoV on 20 May, whereupon he was transferred to the nationally designated treatment facility for isolation. The patient has no history of exposure to known risk factors in the 14 days prior to detection. Investigation of the source of infection is ongoing.The two additional cases were laboratory-confirmed for MERS-CoV on 21 May. One is a household contact. The other is a patient who shared the same hospital room with the first case. Currently, all three patients are in stable condition.Contact tracing of household contacts and healthcare contacts is ongoing for the cases.Globally, WHO has been notified of 1134 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 427 related deaths.",

The outbreak is of high concern because it affects a densely populated urban area of more one million people, creating a high risk of rapid spread and a large caseload.Laboratory tests have confirmed the predominance of Neisseria meningitidis (Nm) serogroup C in the affected areas, with Nm serogroup W also being identified in several patient samples. Although serogroup C has been the predominant cause of meningitis in wealthy countries, it has never been of high concern in Africa. Over the past 40 years, serogroup C has caused only sporadic cases and a few localized outbreaks in Africa, generally of mixed serogroup A and C origin. These outbreaks occurred in Nigeria in 1975, in Niger in 1991, and in Nigeria in 2013\u20132014. Viewed against this historical pattern, the outbreak in Niger is an alarming development. Since this is the first large outbreak in Africa of meningitis caused by serogroup C, vaccines against this form of the disease are in short supply.Public health response: case fatality drops despite vaccine shortageA national epidemic committee has been activated to manage the outbreak. An international team, composed of staff from WHO and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), was deployed to support the Ministry of Public Health\u2019s investigation of the outbreak and reinforce the country\u2019s surveillance capacity. WHO and partners are providing support to the government of Niger for the implementation of mass vaccination campaigns and other emergency control measures. Instrumental in this effort is the International Coordinating Group on Vaccine Provision for Epidemic Meningitis Control (ICG). ICG is a partnership uniting WHO, UNICEF, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, and M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF). It works closely with vaccine manufacturers. It was established in 1997 following exceptionally large and deadly meningitis outbreaks in Africa. To date, ICG has approved four vaccination requests. Vaccines released include 460,000 doses of the older polysaccharide vaccine (produced by Instituto Finlay and Bio-Manguinhos), which protects against the A, C and W serogroups, and 200,000 doses of the newer conjugate vaccine (produced by Sanofi-Pasteur), which protects against serogroups A,C, W, and Y.The conjugate vaccine, which is produced in small quantities for use in the US and European markets at prices that are unaffordable in Africa, was a result of the intervention of ICG and financial support from the GAVI Alliance. In addition, Niger\u2019s government has obtained 200,000 doses of polysaccharide ACWY vaccine from the government of Mali.Since multivalent conjugate vaccines were licensed in the US and Europe, the production of polysaccharide vaccines has dropped considerably and is now largely limited to use by international travellers. No further polysaccharide multivalent vaccines are available outside the stockpile maintained by ICG. In response to this emergency situation, WHO, on behalf of ICG, has negotiated with public sector vaccine manufacturers and the pharmaceutical industry to start the urgent production of multivalent polysaccharide vaccines. An additional 640,000 doses will be dispatched to Niger in the coming weeks.Vaccine campaigns targeting children aged 2 to 15 years are ongoing in 8 of the 11 epidemic districts, including Niamey. MSF is supporting the Ministry of Public Health with teams of doctors and case management facilities; 18,500 vials of ceftriaxone, a highly effective antibiotic, have been made available with ICG support. Thanks to these interventions, case fatality from meningitis has dropped in the past few weeks from 11% to 6.8%. WHO and partners are supporting the Ministry of Health in the outbreaks surveillance, population sensitization and preventive measures.Meningitis vaccines: a problematic supplyOutbreaks of meningitis pose an enormous burden to the populations of African countries. The area known as the African meningitis belt, which stretches across the continent from Senegal to Ethiopia, affecting 21 countries, is hyperendemic for this disease. Cases frequently recur, with periodic outbreaks during the dry season, which runs from December to June.Large-scale outbreaks in 1996\u20131997 caused more than 200,000 cases, including 20,000 deaths. The most recent large outbreak occurred in 2009, causing more than 80,000 cases, mainly in Nigeria and Niger. The vast majority of these outbreaks were caused by serogroup A. Since 2010, a new conjugate vaccine, MenAfriVac, which protects against serogroup A and costs less than $1 a dose, has been progressively introduced in preventive mass campaigns in countries of the African Belt. The new vaccine was developed especially for Africa by the Meningitis Vaccine Project, coordinated by WHO and PATH.Since introduction of the new vaccine, the number of meningitis A cases in Africa has decreased dramatically, with no outbreaks caused by this serotype occurring in vaccinated areas (see the Weekly Epidemiological Record published on 27 March 2015 \u2013 among the Related Links). The meningitis A conjugate vaccine is the only currently available and affordable vaccine that can be used to prevent meningitis outbreaks in Africa, as it confers long-lasting immunity. All other vaccines used in Africa for other serogroups are the older polysaccharide vaccines, which confer immunity lasting only 3 to 5 years. These vaccines are now used only in the emergency response to outbreaks, and are not suitable for the preferred objective of prevention.Following introduction of the meningitis A conjugate vaccine, the market for polysaccharide vaccines shrank considerably and is now largely limited to international travellers. The International Coordinating Group on Vaccine Provision for Epidemic Meningitis Control, or ICG, which manages an emergency vaccine stockpile, has been instrumental in maintaining an adequate supply of these older polysaccharide vaccines for use in emergencies. To prepare for the 2015 epidemic season, WHO and its partners in ICG sent an advance request to vaccine manufacturers for 1.5 million doses of multivalent polysaccharide vaccines and 1.5 million doses of the new meningitis A conjugate vaccine.Due to production problems with one manufacturer, this request could not be fully met. To fill the gap in the stockpile supply, WHO asked two public sector manufacturers, the Instituto Finlay in Cuba and Bio-Manguinhos in Brazil, and one pharmaceutical company, GlaxoSmithKline, to supply 600,000 and 500,000 doses of polysaccharide vaccine respectively.This vaccine shortage highlights the importance of accelerating the development of a multivalent conjugate vaccine affordable for the people and governments of Africa. For now, WHO continues to work with ICG and other partners to ensure that the stockpile of polysaccharide vaccines is maintained at a level sufficiently high to manage future outbreaks in Africa\u2019s meningitis belt.",

        "Description of the Situation": "On 9 May 2015, the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) of China notified WHO of 6 additional laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A (H7N9) virus, including 2 deaths.Onset dates ranged from 26 March to 12 April 2015. Cases ranged in age from 3 to 67 years with a mean age of 36 years. Of these 6 cases, 4 (67%) were male. Four cases (67%) reported exposure to poultry related environment and 2 cases (33%) had unknown exposure. No clusters were reported. Cases were reported from five provinces and municipalities: Anhui (1), Fujian (1), Jiangsu (1), Shanghai (1), and Zhejiang (2).The Chinese Government has taken the following surveillance and control measuresStrengthen outbreak surveillance and situation analysis;Reinforce case management and medical treatment;Conduct risk communication with the public and dissemination information.WHO is assessing the epidemiological situation and conducting further risk assessment based on the latest information. Overall, the public health risk from avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses has not changed.Comparing with previous two months, the infection case number is decreasing. Further sporadic human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) infection are expected in affected and possibly neighboring areas. Should human cases from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during or after arrival. If this were to occur, community level spread is considered unlikely as the virus does not have the ability to transmit easily among humans.",

        "WHO Advice": "WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid poultry farms, or contact with animals in live bird markets, or entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travellers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, in order to ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005), and continue national health preparedness actions.",

        "Description of the Situation": "On 10 April 2015, the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) of China notified WHO of 20 additional laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A (H7N9) virus, including 4 deaths.Onset dates ranged from 14 February to 21 March 2015. Cases ranged in age from 32 to 80 years with a mean age of 55 years. Of these 20 cases, 15 (75%) were male. The majority (18 cases, 90%) reported exposure to live poultry. One case is a health care worker, who had also poultry exposure. No clusters were reported. Cases were reported from five provinces: Anhui (3), Fujian (2), Guangdong (4), Shandong (1), and Zhejiang (10). The Chinese Government has taken the following surveillance and control measuresStrengthen epidemiological and etiological monitoring and situation analysis;Strengthen case management and medical treatment;Provide information to the public and conduct risk communication with the public.WHO is assessing the epidemiological situation and conducting further risk assessment based on the latest information. Overall, the public health risk from avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses has not changed. Comparing with the previous two months, the infection case number is decreasing and no new infected province has been reported. Further sporadic human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) infection are expected in affected and possibly neighboring areas. Should human cases from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during or after arrival. If this were to occur, community level spread is considered unlikely as the virus does not have the ability to transmit easily among humans.",

        "WHO Risk Assessment": "",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid poultry farms, or contact with animals in live bird markets, or entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travellers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, in order to ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005), and continue national health preparedness actions.",

        "Description of the Situation": "On 24 February 2015, the Ministry of Health of Uganda notified WHO of a typhoid fever outbreak.The outbreak started in Kampala City at the beginning of 2015. As of 5 March 2015, a total of 1940 suspected cases have been reported. From the first epicentre in downtown Kampala, the outbreak has now spread to all divisions in the capital city and to neighbouring districts. The most affected groups are young males aged between 20 and 39 years. The majority of cases work in the business sector or as casual labourers. Food and juice vendors and cooks are also affected, hence the potential for wide spread of the disease. At the beginning of the outbreak Salmonella Typhi was laboratory-confirmed in 4 of 16 tested specimens. Further specimens have been tested during the outbreak identifying 5 isolates of Salmonella paratyphi group A. Contaminated drinking water and juices have been identified as the main sources of infection. The majority of water sources that have been tested were heavily contaminated with Escherichia coli and fecal matter.",
        "Epidemiology": "Typhoid fever is a bacterial disease caused by Salmonella typhi. It is transmitted through the ingestion of food or drink contaminated by the feces or urine of infected people. Symptoms usually develop 1\u20133 weeks after exposure, and may be mild or severe. They include high fever, malaise, headache, constipation or diarrhoea, rose-coloured spots on the chest, and enlarged spleen and liver. Healthy carrier state may follow acute illness. Typhoid fever can be treated with antibiotics. However, resistance to common antimicrobials is widespread. Healthy carriers should be excluded from handling food.",
        "Public Health Response": "The National Task Force has been activated to manage the outbreak. With support from WHO and other partners such as CDC, UNICEF, AFENET, Red Cross and others, the country is implementing control measures. Case management is ongoing. Surveillance has been improved and the situation is being monitored to provide evidence-based guidance for decision-making. Unsafe water sources have been closed and a work plan to address the outbreak is under finalization. Safe water is being provided in the affected locations and intensive social mobilization is ongoing to inform the population on expected behaviours. Due to the high risk of disease spread, urgent interventions are needed to provide a global and systemic response to the outbreak, including reinforcement of a multi-sectorial approach, qualified human resources to support the surveillance and financial resources for timely implementation of the validated work plan.",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "Between 26 January and 5 March 2015, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) of the Federal Ministry of Health of Nigeria notified WHO of 652 suspected cases of meningococcal disease, including 50 deaths. Cases have been reported in 10 local government areas of 2 states, Kebbi and Sokoto. Laboratory tests have confirmed the predominance of Neisseria meningitidis serogroup C in the affected areas, with no other serogroups being identified.In Zamfara state, there has been a recent emergence of suspected cases of meningococcal disease; however, an outbreak has not yet been confirmed.",
        "Epidemiology": "Cerebrospinal meningitides is a bacterial disease caused by infection of several microorganisms; among these,\u00a0Neisseria Meningitides\u00a0(Nm) is the most common cause of bacterial meningitis. The disease is highly contagious with seasonal epidemics in many African countries. Since the introduction of the Men A conjugate vaccine (MenAfrivac), which protects against the most prevalent type of Nm (serogroup A) the occurrence of the disease has declined significantly. From 2011 to 2014, the government of Nigeria conducted mass campaigns with the type A vaccine in all states at risk, including Kebbi state. Still, the risk of other types of Neisseria meningitides persists, as evidenced by the current Nm C outbreak. The disease can be cured with antibiotics and prevented with vaccines.",
        "Public Health Response": "A national task force was activated to manage the outbreak. WHO and partners, including M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res and UNICEF, are closely monitoring the situation, and providing support to the government of Nigeria for the implementation of a mass vaccination campaign and other emergency control measures. The International Coordinating Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision for Epidemic Meningitis Control has released 204 850 doses of vaccine, with the support of the GAVI Alliance, as well as 5 000 antibiotic vials to respond to the outbreak. Case management and social mobilisation activities are also ongoing.",

It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS\u2010CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.",

        "Description of the Situation": "On 9 March 2015, the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) of China notified WHO of 59 additional laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus, including 17 fatal cases. Onset dates ranged from 21 January to 25 February 2015. Below is a breakdown of the 59 cases included in this notification by epidemiological week of symptom onset:Week 4 (19 \u2013 25 January) 5 casesWeek 5 (26 January \u2013 1 February) 13 casesWeek 6 (2 \u2013 8 February) 9 casesWeek 7 (9 \u2013 15 February) 15 casesWeek 8 (16 \u2013 22 February) 14 casesWeek 9 (24 \u2013 25 February) 3 casesOf these 59 cases, 44 (75%) were male. The majority (49 cases, 83%) reported exposure to live poultry or live poultry markets; the exposure history of six cases is unknown or unavailable. Three family clusters were reported, each comprised of two cases; four of the six cases had exposure to live poultry or live poultry markets, one case had no exposure to poultry, and one case is still under investigation. Cases were reported from nine provinces: Anhui (4), Fujian (1), Guangdong (35), Guizhou (1), Hunan (2), Jiangsu (3), Jiangxi (1), Shanghai (1), and Zhejiang (11).The Chinese Government has taken the following surveillance and control measuresStrengthen epidemiological and etiological monitoring and situation analysis.Strengthen case management and medical treatment.Further strengthen measures like disinfection of commercial live poultry markets, closure of live poultry markets in places where infections occurred, and promotion of centralized slaughter and frozen products.Provide information to the public.WHO is monitoring the epidemiological situation and conducting further risk assessment based on the latest information.Further sporadic human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) infection are expected in affected and possibly neighbouring areas. Should human cases from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during or after arrival. If this were to occur, community level spread is considered unlikely as the virus does not appear to have the ability to transmit easily among humans.",

Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travellers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, in order to ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005), and continue national health preparedness actions.",

The majority of cases (103) are linked to an amusement park in California, which they visited between 17 and 20 December 2014. The outbreak likely started from a traveler who became infected overseas with measles and visited the amusement park while infectious; however, no source has been identified.CanadaCanada is investigating two separate measles outbreaks. On 3 February, the Lanaudiere Public Health Department of the Agency for Health and Social Services in Quebec province reported a total of 8 suspected cases of measles since the beginning of 2015. These suspected cases are members of the same family, who are unimmunized for religious reasons. They are linked to the current outbreak in the United States. On 2 February 2015, in Ontario province, the Toronto Public Health reported 4 laboratory-confirmed cases of measles, involving 2 children under the age of two and 2 adults from four different families. As of yet, no source has been identified and there are no known links or contact between the cases. Contact tracing of exposed contacts is underway for the two outbreaks.MexicoThe Mexico IHR National Focal Point reported 2 imported cases of measles with history of travel to the United States. The first case is a 22-month-old female from Baja California Sur, Mexico (rash onset 30 December 2014) with history of travel to California from 16 to 18 December 2014.

So far, no further cases have been registered in Mexico.\nBrazilOngoing measles transmission has being reported in the northern states of Pernambuco and Cear\u00e1, Brazil for the period 2013-2015. Measles virus was first detected in Pernambuco on 19 March 2013. From that time to the end of the outbreak, on 14 March 2014, a total of 224 confirmed cases, including one fatal case, were reported in 24 municipalities. The most affected group was children under 1 year old (44.6%; 110/224).

Of the 83 cases, there were 19 deaths reported, ranged in age from 7 to 78 years with a mean age of 50 years. 60 of these 83 cases were male. The majority (78 cases, 93%) reported exposure to live poultry or live poultry markets; the exposure history of 4 cases is unknown.Three family clusters were reported, each comprised of 2 cases; all had exposure to live poultry or live poultry markets. Cases were reported from 8 provinces: Fujian (30), Guangdong (30), Jiangsu (7), Jiangxi (1), Shandong (1), Shanghai (2), Xinjiang (1), and Zhejiang (11).The Chinese Government has taken the following surveillance and control measuresStrengthen surveillance and situation analysis.Reinforce case management and medical treatment.Conduct risk communication with the public and release information.WHO, in close collaboration with China, is monitoring the epidemiological situation and conducting further risk assessment based on the latest information.Further sporadic human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) infection are expected in affected and possibly neighbouring areas. Should human cases from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during or after arrival.

Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.",
