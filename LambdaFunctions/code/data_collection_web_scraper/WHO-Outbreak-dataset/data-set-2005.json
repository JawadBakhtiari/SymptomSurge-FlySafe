        "Description of the Situation": "30 December 2005\n\nThe Ministry of Health of China has confirmed an additional case of human infection on the mainland with the H5N1 avian influenza virus. The case is a 41-year-old woman from the south-eastern province of Fujian. She developed symptoms of fever followed by pneumonia on 6 December, and was admitted to hospital two days later. The patient died on 21 December. \n\nOn 13 December, initial laboratory tests on samples from the patient tested negative for H5N1. But further tests on 23 December \u2013 including PCR tests carried out at the Chinese Center for Disease Control in Beijing \u2013 showed positive results. The virus was also isolated from the patient.\n\nClose contacts who have been placed under medical observation have not displayed any symptoms, health authorities report. \n\nAgricultural authorities so far have not been able to confirm the presence of the H5 virus subtype in poultry in the vicinity of the patient\u2019s residence or place of work. Investigators have not been able to confirm any direct contact between the patient and poultry prior to the onset of illness. The investigation, however, is continuing and answers to these and other questions are still being sought.\n\nThis is China\u2019s seventh laboratory-confirmed human case. Of these cases, three have been fatal (including this latest case). To date, China has reported human cases in six provinces and regions: Hunan, Anhui, Guangxi, Liaoning, Jiangxi and Fujian.",

        "Description of the Situation": "9 December 2005\n\nChina\n\nThe Ministry of Health in China has confirmed a further case of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus. The case is a 31-year-old female farmer from the north-eastern province of Liaoning. She developed symptoms on 30 October and subsequently underwent extensive hospital care for severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress. She recovered and was discharged from hospital on 29 November.\n\nInitial tests on this case produced negative results for infection with the H5 virus subtype. Diagnostic confirmation was made following antibody testing using a microneutralization test. Using this test, a positive diagnosis is made when antibody levels in a blood sample taken late in illness are at least four times higher than those found in a sample taken early in illness. Diagnostic confirmation using antibody tests, though reliable, is thus slower than that achieved using direct tests for virus RNA.\n\nBeginning in late October, Chinese authorities have reported several outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in poultry in Liaoning Province. Investigation of this case has linked the woman\u2019s infection to direct exposure to diseased poultry. Agricultural authorities have detected the H5N1 virus in samples taken from poultry in the province.\n\nAs a precaution, local authorities placed contacts of the woman under medical observation pending definitive laboratory results. No signs of influenza-like illness were detected, and all contacts have now been released from observation.\n\nThis is China\u2019s fifth laboratory-confirmed case. Of these cases, two were fatal. The cases have been reported from four provinces: Anhui, Hunan, Guangxi, and Liaoning.\n\nThailand\n\nThe Ministry of Public Health in Thailand has confirmed a further case of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus. The case occurred in a 5-year-old boy, who developed symptoms on 25 November, was hospitalized on 5 December, and died on 7 December. The child resided in the central province of Nakhonnayok.\n\nA thorough investigation of this case is currently under way. Early results suggest that the child may have acquired his infection from dead chickens in the neighbourhood. His family members and neighbours have been placed under medical observation. All remain healthy to date.\n\nThe child is the fifth laboratory-confirmed case in Thailand this year and the second death. Since January 2004, Thailand has reported 22 cases, of which 14 were fatal.",

The case is a 16-year-old boy from West Java Province. He developed symptoms of fever and cough on 6 November, followed by breathing difficulties a few days later. He was hospitalized on 16 November and remains in stable condition.\n\nA field investigation of this case determined that two siblings had died 5 days before his hospitalization. His two brothers, aged 7 and 20 years, had onset of illness on 3 November and died on 11 November, following symptoms of fever and breathing difficulty. The presumptive diagnosis was typhoid fever. No samples were taken before burial, which precludes definitive diagnosis. WHO reports laboratory-confirmed cases only.\n\nNo other cases of influenza-like illness were detected in the 80 households of the village.\n\nThe field investigation found that chickens in the family household had died during the two weeks preceding onset of illness in the deceased brothers. Samples from animals have been collected for testing and the investigation continues.\n\nThe newly confirmed case brings the total number in Indonesia to 12. Of these cases, 7 were fatal.\n\nChina\n\nAt the invitation of the Chinese Ministry of Health, WHO is participating in a joint mission to Anhui Province to investigate circumstances surrounding the recent detection of two human cases of H5N1 infection in that province. Both cases, which were confirmed by laboratory tests earlier this month, occurred in female farmers aged 24 and 35 years. Both cases were fatal.\n\nThe team will be gathering information about the sources of exposure in these two cases and will also assess the effectiveness of public health measures introduced in the areas. The two cases lived some distance apart; no link between the two cases is thought to exist.\n\nChina has recently experienced a recurrence of outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in poultry. Beginning in mid-October of this year, officials have reported 25 fresh outbreaks in poultry in nine provinces.

She developed symptoms on 1 November, was hospitalized with severe pneumonia on 7 November, and died on 10 November.\n\nTesting was conducted by the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention in Beijing.\n\nAn additional two possible human cases have been investigated in Hunan Province. The first is the boy\u2019s 12-year-old sister. She was hospitalized on 16 October and died the following day of severe bilateral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Samples from the girl are inadequate for testing, and the cause of her death will probably never be known with certainty. Although evidence pointing to H5N1 infection is considered substantial by Chinese experts, WHO reports only laboratory-confirmed cases.\n\nThe additional case under investigation in Hunan is a 36-year-old schoolteacher. He was hospitalized with pneumonia on 24 October. Definitive test results are pending. A WHO team with expertise in virology and laboratory diagnosis has collaborated with national experts in the investigation of the cases in Hunan.\n\nSurveillance for human cases in China intensified over the past month following a recurrence of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in poultry. Since 19 October, China has reported 11 fresh outbreaks of the disease in six provinces, from Liaoning in the northeast of the country to Xinjiang in the far west. Hunan and Anhui \u2013 the two provinces with confirmed cases \u2013 are among the recently affected provinces.\n\nIndonesia\n\nThe Ministry of Health in Indonesia has today confirmed a further two cases of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus. Both cases were fatal.\n\nThe first newly confirmed case was a 16-year-old girl from Jakarta. She developed symptoms on 4 November, was hospitalized on 6 November, and died on 8 November.\n\nThe second case was a 20-year-old woman from Jakarta. She developed symptoms on 5 November, was hospitalized on 9 November, and died on 12 November.\n\nBoth cases were confirmed by a WHO reference laboratory in Hong Kong. Field investigations are under way.\n\nThe newly confirmed cases bring the total in Indonesia to 11. Of these, 7 have been fatal.",

        "Description of the Situation": "7 November 2005\n\nToday, the Angolan Ministry of Health has declared the Marburg haemorrhagic fever outbreak over.\n\nThe largest and deadliest outbreak of Marburg haemorrhagic fever on record* In mid-March the Angola Ministry of Health (MOH) along with WHO actively investigated reports of 63 deaths (mostly children and three health care workers) among patients at the Uige Provincial Hospital, Angola. On 21 March, Marburg haemorrhagic fever was identified as the cause of the outbreak by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Following the laboratory confirmation, the MOH asked WHO to mobilize technical assistance and financial aid to help control the outbreak.\n\nThe international response to the outbreak in Angola began on 22 March. The team from WHO, included experts from the Inter-country programme for southern Africa, the Regional Office for Africa (AFRO) and from Headquarters, and partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN). (see below the list of partners and organizations who worked with the Ministry of Health to control the outbreak). In addition M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res (Belgium, France, Holland and Spain) assisted with infection control and established isolation facilities in Uige, Luanda, Songo and Negage hospitals.\n\nThe Angolan Government, WHO and other partners, established a surveillance system for identification of suspected cases and follow up of their contacts. Mobile teams were sent to the field to investigate rumours, obtain clinical specimens for laboratory tests, hospitalize suspected patients and monitor their contacts.\n\nA portable field laboratory established by the Canadian National Microbiology Laboratory began operating in Uige on 4 April and a second laboratory operated by the US CDC in Luanda became operational on 10 April. Field laboratories provide rapid and sufficiently reliable results for use during an outbreak, when decisions about appropriate case management and contact tracing need to be made quickly.\n\nThe disease spread particularly among people exposed to the Marburg virus during home care or at funerals, via contact with body fluids of those who died from the disease. The dangerous use of home-based injections was also identified as a major cause of the outbreak's spread.\n\nEarly in the outbreak there was considerable confusion among the local population due to mistrust of the health-care system. Most preferred home-based care given by their traditional healers or family members. Intensive social mobilization campaigns were implemented successfully in the whole province to restore confidence and trust. A key element of the strategy was to include in the team traditional healers, pastors, teachers and community workers and to use a wide variety of communication formats. Guidance from two medical anthropologists, from the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique in Paris, who joined the outbreak control team was also critical for the community compliance with outbreak control measures.\n\nThe last laboratory-confirmed case was on 22 July 2005.\n\n* From \"Marburg haemorrhagic fever: Angola 2005 outbreak\".

        "Description of the Situation": "13 October 2005\n\nTests conducted by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) have today confirmed the presence of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in samples taken from domestic birds in Turkey.\n\nIn Romania, investigations of recent poultry deaths have, to date, identified the H5 subtype of avian influenza virus. Further testing is under way to determine the strain and whether the virus is highly pathogenic. Authorities in the two countries have undertaken control measures as recommended by OIE and FAO. WHO is sending diagnostic reagents and other supplies to support testing in national laboratories. Viruses from both outbreaks have been sent for further analysis to the Central Veterinary Laboratory Agency-Weybridge (UK), which is an OIE/FAO reference laboratory. Viruses are also being sent to WHO reference laboratories for comparison with human H5N1 isolates from Asia.\n\nPublic health implications\n\nThe spread of H5N1 to poultry in new areas is of concern as it increases opportunities for further human cases to occur. However, all evidence to date indicates that the H5N1 virus does not spread easily from birds to infect humans. WHO advises countries experiencing outbreaks in poultry to follow certain precautions, particularly during culling operations, and to monitor persons with a possible exposure history for fever or respiratory symptoms. The early symptoms of H5N1 infection mimic those of many other common respiratory illnesses, meaning that false alarms are likely.\n\nThe WHO level of pandemic alert remains unchanged at phase 3: a virus new to humans is causing infections, but does not spread easily from one person to another.\n\nWHO continues to recommend that travellers to areas experiencing outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 in poultry should avoid contact with live animal markets and poultry farms. Large amounts of the virus are known to be excreted in the droppings from infected birds. Populations in affected countries are advised to avoid contact with dead migratory birds or wild birds showing signs of disease.\n\nDirect contact with infected poultry, or surfaces and objects contaminated by their droppings, is considered the main route of human infection. Exposure risk is considered highest during slaughter, defeathering, butchering, and preparation of poultry for cooking. There is no evidence that properly cooked poultry or poultry products can be a source of infection.\n\nCountries located along migratory routes need to be vigilant for signs of disease in wild and domestic birds. Recent events make it likely that some migratory birds are now implicated in the direct spread of the H5N1 virus in its highly pathogenic form.",

        "Description of the Situation": "29 September 2005\n\nThe Ministry of Health in Indonesia has today confirmed another fatal human case of H5N1 avian influenza. The patient, a 27-year-old woman from Jakarta, developed symptoms on 17 September, was hospitalized on 19 September, and died on 26 September.\n\nConfirmatory testing was conducted at a WHO reference laboratory in Hong Kong.\n\nInitial investigation has revealed that the woman had direct contact with diseased and dying chickens in her household shortly before the onset of illness.\n\nThe woman is the fourth laboratory-confirmed case of H5N1 infection in Indonesia. Three of these cases were fatal.\n\nAs a result of intensified surveillance and heightened public concern, growing numbers of people with respiratory symptoms or possible exposure to the virus are being admitted to hospital for observation and, when appropriate, treatment. Until a conclusive diagnosis is made, these patients are classified by the Ministry of Health as suspect cases. While many do not have symptoms compatible with a diagnosis of H5N1 infection, screening of patient samples is being undertaken in national laboratories as part of efforts to ensure that no new cases are missed.\n\nLaboratory testing to confirm human infection with H5N1 avian influenza is technically difficult; some tests produce inconclusive or unreliable results. To ensure a reliable assessment of the situation in Indonesia, authorities are, after initial screening, continuing to send samples from people considered likely to have H5N1 infection to WHO reference laboratories for diagnostic confirmation.\n\nAccording to FAO, highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza is now endemic in poultry in many parts of Indonesia. As influenza virus activity in Indonesia may increase during the wet season, from November to April, human exposure to animal virus could be greater during the coming months. Further sporadic human cases can be anticipated.",

        "Description of the Situation": "23 September 2005\n\nThe current wave of cholera outbreaks which had begun several weeks ago in West Africa is still ongoing (see map below). Seasonal factors, with a particularly heavy rainy season, along with increased population movements in the area contribute to this unusually high incidence of cholera.\n\nWHO, with international and national health partners, is providing technical support to the ministries of health at the country and sub-regional level. WHO is working to strengthen surveillance activities. Supplies for case management and chlorination of water have also been dispatched to some of the countries.\n\nBreakdown by country:\n\nBenin: The outbreak which started in Cotonou in early June has now spread to Oueme region. A total of 210 cases including 4 deaths has been reported between 6 June and 4 September. Information is being provided to the community and water points are being chlorinated.\n\nBurkina Faso: A total of 615 cases including 9 deaths (case fatality rate -CFR 1.5%) have been reported in Ouagadougou town between the 8 August and 4 September, affecting sectors of the town with precarious water and sanitation conditions. Efficient control measures have been put in place, focusing on providing relevant information to the public. The outbreak currently seems to be under control.\n\nGuinea: 1956 cases including 72 deaths (CFR 3.7%) have been reported between mid-July and 4 September. Control efforts are ongoing with special emphasis on environmental management for the two most affected towns, Conakry and Kindia.\n\nGuinea-Bissau: 14 303 cases including 252 deaths (CFR 1.8%) occurred between 6 June and 11 September in the country. The regions of Bissau and Bimbo account for 77% of cases; cholera has spread to all 11 regions of the country. A WHO team is currently providing on site support to the Ministry of health.\n\nMali: 158 cases including 20 deaths (CFR 12.65%) have occurred between 20 June and 24 July. The situation appears to be under control, although cholera is an ongoing problem in Mali.\n\nMauritania: A total of 2640 cases including 55 deaths (CFR 2%) has been reported from 6 regions between the 20 July to 21 September. Nouakchott accounts for 89% of all the cases.\n\nNiger: Between the 10 and 19 September, 72 cases including 9 deaths have been reported from Tahoua region, with Bouza district being the most affected. The outbreak is spreading to Tilaberi region who reported 3 cases from Tera district. To date, a total of 431 cases including 44 deaths (CFR 10%) has been reported between 13 July and 19 September.\n\nSenegal: A resurgence of the cholera outbreak which started early this year has recently occurred. Dakar is most affected, due to the unusually heavy rains. To date, a total of 23 325 cases including 303 deaths (CFR 1.2%) has been reported during the outbreak which began in January and peaked at the end of March..\n\nFor more information WHO cholera website\n\n\n\n\n  The boundaries and names shown and the designations used on this map do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of the World Health Organization concerning the legal status of any country, territory, city or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries.

        "Description of the Situation": "22 September 2005\n\nThe Ministry of Health in Indonesia has today confirmed a further human case of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza. The case, in an 8-year-old boy, was confirmed as positive for H5N1 infection by a WHO reference laboratory in Hong Kong. The boy remains in hospital for observation and treatment. Current investigations in Indonesia have produced no evidence that the H5N1 virus is spreading easily from person to person. \n\nBackground on avian influenza in Indonesia\n\nSince mid-2003, Indonesia has experienced outbreaks of avian influenza in its poultry population. Prior to the new case announced today, two human cases of H5N1 infection in Indonesia have been laboratory confirmed, one in July and another in September. All three cases have been investigated by the Indonesia health authorities, with WHO support, and searches for further cases have been conducted.\n\nAs investigations have produced no evidence that the H5N1 virus is spreading easily from person to person, WHO has not raised its current level of pandemic alert. WHO will, however, continue to monitor the situation closely. Given the experience of other H5N1 affected countries in Asia, the detection of further human cases in Indonesia or elsewhere would not be surprising.\n\nLaboratory confirmation of cases in Indonesia has led to heightened public concern, intensified surveillance for further cases, and strengthened government commitment to contain the disease. As a result, several patients with respiratory symptoms and a history of possible exposure to the avian virus are being evaluated as part of ongoing surveillance efforts. Samples from these patients have also been sent for analysis by the WHO reference laboratory in Hong Kong.\n\nOverall assessment\n\nIn all affected countries, most human cases of H5N1 infection have been linked to contact with poultry. In a few instances, limited human-to-human transmission of the virus may have occurred following close contact with a patient during the acute phase of illness. In all known instances, such transmission has been limited and has not led to larger outbreaks in the general community, indicating that the virus does not spread easily among people at this time.\n\nWHO has sent all countries a document outlining recommended strategic actions for responding to the avian influenza pandemic threat. Recommended actions aim to strengthen national preparedness, reduce opportunities for a pandemic virus to emerge, improve the early warning system, and accelerate vaccine development.\n\nThis document and others can be found at:\n\nWHO avian influenza site\nResponding to the avian influenza pandemic threat.

        "Description of the Situation": "Situation assessment and implications for human health\n\n18 August 2005\n\nBeginning in late July 2005, official reports to the OIE from government authorities indicate that the H5N1 virus has expanded its geographical range. Both Russia and Kazakhstan reported outbreaks of avian influenza in poultry in late July, and confirmed H5N1 as the causative agent in early August. Deaths in migratory birds, infected with the virus, have also been reported. Outbreaks in both countries have been attributed to contact between domestic birds and wild waterfowl via shared water sources.\n\nThese are the first outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza recorded in the two countries. Both countries were previously considered free of the virus.\n\nSince the initial reports, the Russian H5N1 outbreak in poultry, which has remained confined to Siberia, has spread progressively westward to affect 6 administrative regions. In Kazakhstan, several villages bordering the initial outbreak site in Siberia are now known to have experienced disease in poultry. To date, outbreaks in the two countries have involved some large farms as well as small backyard flocks, with close to 120,000 birds dead or destroyed in Russia and more than 9,000 affected in Kazakhstan.\n\nIn early August, Mongolia issued an emergency report following the death of 89 migratory birds at two lakes in the northern part of the country. Avian influenza virus type A has been identified as the cause, but the virus strain has not yet been determined. Samples have been shared with WHO reference laboratories and are currently being investigated. Also in early August, an outbreak of H5N1 in poultry was detected in Tibet, China.\n\nIn all of these recent outbreaks, authorities have announced control measures in line with FAO and OIE recommendations for highly pathogenic avian influenza. To date, no human cases have been detected, vigilance is high, and rumours are being investigated by local authorities.\n\nThe outbreaks in Russia and Kazakhstan provide evidence that H5N1 viruses have spread beyond their initial focus in south-east Asian countries, where outbreaks are now known to have begun in mid-2003. Despite aggressive control efforts, FAO has warned that the H5N1 virus continues to be detected in many parts of Viet Nam and Indonesia and in some parts of Cambodia, China, Thailand, and possibly also Laos. The south-east Asian outbreaks, which have resulted in the death or destruction of more than 150 million birds, have had severe consequences for agriculture and most especially for the many rural farmers who depend on small backyard flocks for income and food. Human cases, most of which have been linked to direct contact with diseased or dead poultry in rural areas, have been confirmed in four countries: Viet Nam, Thailand, Cambodia, and Indonesia. Only a few instances of limited human-to-human transmission have been recorded. Poultry outbreaks of H5N1 avian influenza in Japan, Malaysia, and the Republic of Korea were successfully controlled.\n\nWHO fully agrees with FAO and OIE that control of avian influenza infection in wild bird populations is not feasible and should not be attempted. Wild waterfowl have been known for some time to be the natural reservoir of all influenza A viruses. Migratory birds can carry these viruses, in their low pathogenic form, over long distances, but do not usually develop signs of illness and only rarely die of the disease. The instances in which highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses have been detected in migratory birds are likewise rare, and the role of these birds in the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza remains poorly understood.\n\nVery large die-offs of migratory birds from avian influenza, such as the one detected at the end of April at Qinghai Lake in central China, in which more than 6,000 birds died, are considered unusual. Research published in July indicates that H5N1 viruses in that outbreak are similar to viruses that have been circulating in south-east Asia for the last two years.\n\nAnalyses of viruses from the Russian outbreak, recently published on the OIE website, show apparent similarity to viruses isolated from migratory birds during the Qinghai Lake outbreak. Specimens from the Mongolian outbreak in migratory birds should also prove useful in shedding light on these recent developments. Monitoring the spread and evolution of avian H5N1 viruses in birds and rapidly comparing these results with previously characterized H5N1 viruses is an essential activity for assessing the risk of pandemic influenza.\n\nImplications for human health\n\nThe poultry outbreaks in Russia and Kazakhstan are caused by a virus that has repeatedly demonstrated its ability, in outbreaks in Hong Kong in 1997, in Hong Kong in 2003, and in south-east Asia since early 2004, to cross the species barrier to infect humans, causing severe disease with high fatality. A similar risk of human cases exists in areas newly affected with H5N1 disease in poultry.\n\nExperience in south-east Asia indicates that human cases of infection are rare, and that the virus does not transmit easily from poultry to humans. To date, the majority of human cases have occurred in rural areas. Most, but not all, human cases have been linked to direct exposure to dead or diseased poultry, notably during slaughtering, defeathering, and food preparation. No cases have been confirmed in poultry workers or cullers. No cases have been linked to the consumption of properly cooked poultry meat or eggs.\n\nFactors relating to poultry densities and farming systems seen in different countries may also influence the risk that human cases will occur. During a 2003 outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza, caused by the H7N7 strain, in the Netherlands, more than 80 cases of conjunctivitis were detected in poultry workers, cullers, and their close contacts, and one veterinarian died. That event, which was contained following the destruction of around 30 million poultry, underscores the need for newly affected countries to follow FAO/OIE/WHO recommended precautions when undertaking control measures in affected farms.\n\nPandemic risk assessment\n\nThe possible spread of H5N1 avian influenza to poultry in additional countries cannot be ruled out. WHO recommends heightened surveillance for outbreaks in poultry and die-offs in migratory birds, and rapid introduction of containment measures, as recommended by FAO and OIE. Heightened vigilance for cases of respiratory disease in persons with a history of exposure to infected poultry is also recommended in countries with known poultry outbreaks. The provision of clinical specimens and viruses, from humans and animals, to WHO and OIE/FAO reference laboratories allows studies that contribute to the assessment of pandemic risk and helps ensure that work towards vaccine development stays on course.\n\nThe expanding geographical presence of the virus is of concern as it creates further opportunities for human exposure. Each additional human case increases opportunities for the virus to improve its transmissibility, through either adaptive mutation or reassortment. The emergence of an H5N1 strain that is readily transmitted among humans would mark the start of a pandemic.",

Of these human cases, 38 have been fatal. As reported by China, 18 patients are critically ill.\n\nVirtually all cases have occurred in Sichuan Province, where infections with Streptococcus suis have been detected in pigs in a concurrent outbreak. The province has one of the largest pig populations in China.\n\nInvestigation and containment of the outbreak have been given high priority by Chinese authorities. The country\u2019s ministries of health and agriculture are working in close collaboration, and WHO and FAO are being promptly informed of new developments.\n\nInvestigations conducted by Chinese epidemiologists indicate that the first human cases occurred at the end of June in Ziyang City, Sichuan Province. From 24 June through 21 July, the authorities reported 20 cases of illness, of unknown cause, admitted to three hospitals in that city. WHO was officially informed of the outbreak on 22 July, at which time 20 cases and 9 deaths had been reported.\n\nCases have since been reported in 11 prefectures in Sichuan Province. Most cases reported have occurred in adult male farmers. Information reported to WHO suggests that close contact with diseased or dead pigs is the principal source of human infection.\n\nSymptoms reported by local clinicians include high fever, malaise, nausea, and vomiting, followed by meningitis, subcutaneous haemorrhage, toxic shock, and coma in severe cases. The incubation period is short and disease progression is rapid.\n\nLocal experts are conducting active searches for further cases. To date, Chinese authorities say they have found no evidence of human-to-human transmission.\n\nThe outbreak in humans has some unusual features and is being closely followed by WHO. Diagnostic testing to further characterize the causative agent is recommended as an essential part of ongoing efforts to understand this outbreak, ensure its rapid containment, and prevent further deaths.",

The Minister of Agriculture stated that laboratory results detected H5-infected bird faeces in a bird cage opposite side of the road of the family's house; cloacal and throat swabs of the pet bird inside the cage were negative for H5. This is the first, and, thus far, the only, indication of a possible source of exposure. Other environmental sampling was negative.\n\nThe Ministry of Health is continuing to monitor over 300 contacts. None of the contacts have shown any symptoms to date. Seroprevalence results are still pending. Surveillance has been intensified in affected areas and throughout the country. Forty-four referral hospitals have been identified and are being prepared to receive possible cases. Health education campaigns are being conducted nationwide.\n\nThe government has reinforced coordination between relevant government bodies, including the Ministries of Health and Agriculture, and is monitoring the situation in close collaboration with the World Health Organization.",

        "Description of the Situation": "1 July 2005\n\nOn 24 June 2005, the Ministry of Health of Angola reported a polio case. Angola has not had a case of polio since 2001. A 17-month old girl with a previous history of oral polio vaccine (OPV) developed fever and paralysis in both legs on 25 April, in the metropolitan area of the capital, Luanda.\n\nGenetic sequencing of the type-1 wild poliovirus shows that it originated in India. Virological and epidemiological evidence suggest a recent importation. The affected child and her family have no travel history. An investigation did not detect spread beyond the community.\n\nOutreach from routine immunization services has been stepped up in advance of the campaign. The national routine immunization coverage of children against polio is estimated to be 45%.\n\nA nationwide polio vaccination campaign is planned 29-31 July. Authorities are considering the use of a combination of monovalent oral polio vaccine (mOPV) in the immediate area of the case and trivalent oral polio vaccine in the rest of the country for maximum impact. This will be followed by another round in August.\n\nHealth authorities have immediately intensified Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) surveillance in the infected district and surrounding areas and WHO/African Region has notified neighbouring countries.\n\nBriefings with all community and religious leaders, non-governmental organizations and traditional healers are taking place in all municipalities of Luanda.\nFor more information\n\n\nAngola: Polio importation into Angola (01 July) (pdf)  \n\nGlobal Polio Eradication Initiative",

        "Description of the Situation": "30 June 2005\n\nAt the request of the Ministry of Health, WHO sent a team of international experts to Viet Nam last week to assess laboratory and epidemiological data on recent cases and determine whether the present level of pandemic alert should be increased. Team members were drawn from institutes in Australia, Canada, Hong Kong SAR, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America having extensive experience in the testing of avian influenza viruses in human clinical specimens.\n\nThe team completed its work on Wednesday and submitted its preliminary findings to the government. The team found no laboratory evidence suggesting that human infections are occurring with greater frequency or that the virus is spreading readily among humans. The current level of pandemic alert, which has been in effect since January 2004, remains unchanged.\n\nSome reports now circulating suggest that WHO has downgraded its assessment of the pandemic threat. These reports are unfounded. The experts were specifically asked to search for evidence that could substantiate concerns raised first at a  WHO consultation of international experts held at the beginning of May in Manila. That consultation considered suggestive findings, largely based on epidemiological observations, that the H5N1 virus had changed its behaviour in ways consistent with an improved, though not yet efficient, ability to spread directly from one human to another. The specific epidemiological observations considered included milder disease across a broader age spectrum and a growing number of clusters of cases, closely related in time and place.\n\nMore recently, testing of clinical specimens by international experts working in Viet Nam provided further suggestive evidence of more widespread infection with the virus, raising the possibility of community-acquired infection. These findings have not been confirmed by the present investigative team.\n\nFirm evidence of improved transmissibility would be grounds for moving to a higher level of pandemic alert. Because of the huge consequences of such a change, WHO is following a cautious approach that combines heightened vigilance for new cases with immediate international verification of any suggestive findings.\n\nBecause the detection of H5N1 in clinical specimens is technically challenging and prone to errors, members of the investigative team took sophisticated laboratory equipment with them to Hanoi for on-site testing. Tests were performed using WHO-approved reagents and primers.\n\nWhile these first results are reassuring, further retesting of clinical specimens will continue over the next few weeks to provide the most reliable possible foundation for risk assessment.",

        "Description of the Situation": "27 May 2005\n\nAs of 26 May, the Ministry of Health in Angola has reported 399 cases of Marburg haemorrhagic fever. Of these cases, 335 were fatal. The vast majority of cases have occurred in Uige Province, where 388 cases and 324 deaths have been reported.\n\nYesterday, four new suspected cases, of which three were fatal, were reported in Bungo municipality, in Uige Province. Two of these cases have been laboratory confirmed. These are the first cases in this municipality detected since early April. An urgent investigation has been launched to determine whether the Bungo cases can be linked to Uige municipality, where transmission is known to be ongoing. Another focus of transmission would be a disturbing development for outbreak control.\n\nIn Uige municipality, procedures for contact tracing are now operating with greater efficiency. This week, staff from the mobile surveillance teams were able to visit and look for signs of illness in more than half of the 100 persons known to have had close contact with a Marburg patient. New cases are, however, continuing to occur with no known link to a previous case, suggesting that the surveillance system has not yet reached the efficiency needed to interrupt chains of transmission.\n\nLocal and international staff have continued to identify cultural practices that create opportunities for exposure to the virus and thus allow the outbreak to continue. Most recently, around 200 traditional healers have been trained in ways to reduce risks to themselves and their clients and given masks and gloves. To date, at least two traditional healers have died of Marburg haemorrhagic fever.\n\nIntensive educational campaigns, supported by local religious leaders and Red Cross volunteers, about the hazards of home treatment using injections have resulted in the collection and safe disposal of large numbers of syringes. It is not certain, however, that this practice, which is a highly efficient way to spread the virus, has been fully eliminated in Uige\u2019s population.",

        "Description of the Situation": "29 April 2005\n\nAs of 27 April, the Ministry of Health in Angola has reported 275 cases of Marburg haemorrhagic fever. Of these cases, 255 were fatal. In Uige Province, which remains the epicentre of the outbreak, 266 cases, of which 246 have been fatal, were reported as of 28 April.\n\nWith all control measures \u2013 teams, equipment, and protocols \u2013 needed to contain the outbreak now in place, extreme care must be taken to guard against any practices that could again amplify transmission. At this point in the outbreak, an amplification event would be a setback capable of extending the presently intense containment efforts for several weeks. During past outbreaks of viral haemorrhagic fevers, such events have historically resulted in an additional two transmission cycles and a second wave of cases.\n\nControl operations in Uige have experienced some recent setbacks. On two occasions earlier this week, doctors at Uige\u2019s large provincial hospital were directly exposed to blood from Marburg patients being treated on general wards, without adequate infection control. The doctors are under observation. These high-risk exposures should not have occurred.\n\nSuch incidents indicate that infection control procedures at the hospital have been seriously compromised. They occurred despite a system put in place, and supported by equipment and training, to safely screen new admissions for exposure history and fever and ensure the separation of possible cases from patients on the general wards.\n\nIn another recent incident, the body of a deceased patient was left, uncleaned and uncollected, on an open ward for more than eight hours, placing hospital staff and other patients at risk. In another incident, a severely ill baby admitted to the paediatric ward was placed in a cot, without disinfection, immediately after the body of another baby, who died from the disease, had been removed. In line with cultural practices, mothers are present on the paediatric ward and share the care of severely ill children, thus also sharing the exposure risk.\n\nUnder such conditions, amplification of transmission is highly likely to occur. Had safety protocols, set in place by the international team, been followed, none of these incidents would have occurred. Closing of the hospital has been considered but is not a viable option. Such a step would deprive many patients of potentially life-saving care while re-directing others to private clinics, where conditions and practices are even more unsafe and even more likely to result in additional cases.\n\nYesterday, the Minister of Health, accompanied by a vice-minister and the head of the WHO office in Angola, flew to Uige to investigate the situation, find solutions, and oversee their implementation. The officials have recognized that strong measures will be needed to ensure that patients admitted to the hospital for other conditions are not placed at risk of Marburg infection. The first steps to correct the situation were put in place today, and involve the collaboration of ministry officials, WHO, and M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res.\n\nWHO has decided to strengthen the presence in Uige of international staff specialized in infection control. WHO welcomes the direct intervention of ministry officials. This high-level support should help ensure that containment measures, previously set in place and of proven efficacy, are restored and fully adhered to.\n\nInvestigation of several recent fatalities in Uige indicates a clear link between home-based treatments using unsafe syringes and spread of the virus. This problem is being addressed urgently. A massive door-to-door campaign, supported by banners and posters throughout Uige municipality, was launched yesterday to inform residents of the associated dangers and collect and safely destroy syringes. The campaign has continued today.",

        "Date Reported": "22 April 2005",
        "Location": "Angola",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "22 April 2005\n\nAs of 20 April, the Ministry of Health in Angola has reported 266 cases of Marburg haemorrhagic fever. Of these cases, 244 were fatal. In Uige Province, which remains the epicentre of the outbreak, 253 cases, of which 233 have been fatal, were reported as of 21 April.\n\nAssessment of the outbreak\n\nThe international response to the outbreak in Angola began one month ago, on 22 March. The features of Marburg haemorrhagic fever, and the conditions in Angola, have been an extreme test of international capacity to hold emerging diseases at bay. The outbreak in Angola is the largest and deadliest on record for this rare disease, which is presently showing a case fatality rate higher than 90%. For comparison, outbreaks of the closely related Ebola haemorrhagic fever have shown mortality rates ranging, according to the virus strain involved, from 53% to 88%. The only other large outbreak of Marburg, in the Democratic Republic of Congo from 1998 through 2000, had a case fatality of 83%.\n\nTwo factors make the rapid detection of outbreaks of Marburg haemorrhagic fever difficult: the extreme rarity of this disease and its similarity to other diseases seen in countries where deaths from infectious diseases are common. Neither the source nor the date of the initial cases in Angola can be presently identified with any certainty.\n\nThe number of cases began increasing in February and then, more dramatically, in March. On 21 March, Marburg virus was detected in patient samples sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta (USA), and WHO assistance was requested by the Ministry of Health in Angola. The operational response began the following day. As known from extensive experience with outbreaks of other viral haemorrhagic fevers, including Ebola, outbreaks of Marburg can be brought to an end using classic public health interventions. In theory, the measures needed to end the Angolan outbreak are few in number and straightforward in nature. Rapid detection and isolation of patients, tracing and management of their close contacts, infection control in hospitals and protective clothing for staff work to interrupt chains of transmission and thus seal off opportunities for further spread.\n\nSuch straightforward measures are complicated by the distinct features of this disease. The sudden onset, dramatic symptoms, and rapid deterioration of patients, and the absence of a vaccine and effective treatment, invariably incite great anxiety in affected populations. This anxiety, in turn, can interfere with control operations, especially when communities begin hiding cases and bodies because of suspicions about the safety of hospitals.\n\nIn the current outbreak, such suspicions are understandable. Very few patients with laboratory-confirmed Marburg haemorrhagic fever have survived; most hospitalized patients have died within a day or two following admission. For affected communities, staff from the mobile teams, fully suited in protective gear, are seen as taking away relatives and loved ones who may never again be seen alive.\n\nWHO staff in Uige have today reported further signs that community attitudes are improving, though hostility towards the mobile teams remains of concern in one area known to have recent cases and deaths. Efforts to sensitize affected communities are continuing, with local volunteers supported by Portuguese-speaking experts from Brazil and Mozambique.\n\nConditions in Angola \u2013 a country weakened by almost three decades of civil unrest \u2013 have presented additional challenges. Supplies of water and electricity are intermittent, also in health care facilities. Weakened infrastructures, including those for communications and transportation, are another problem. Yesterday, the WHO office in Uige was informed of a death in another municipality, but was unable to collect the body for safe burial because of poor road conditions.\n\nFortunately, spread of the disease beyond Uige Province, located in the interior of the country, has been limited. Of the 266 cases and 244 deaths, 197 cases and 183 deaths occurred in Uige municipality. Other municipalities in Uige Province account for an additional 56 cases and 50 deaths.\n\nWHO believes that the risk of international spread is low. No foreign nationals, with the exception of those involved in the direct care of patients, have been infected. There is no evidence that people can spread the virus before the onset of symptoms. Shortly after symptom onset, patients become rapidly and visibly very ill\n\nWHO is optimistic that the outbreak can be controlled if present activities continue with sufficient vigour. All the essential containment measures are being applied with extensive international support, including more than 60 international staff drawn from institutions in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, and the cooperation of national authorities and experts.\n\nTools and methods developed during international responses to outbreaks of other diseases have all been brought to bear on the present outbreak, and the success of this collaborative effort has surpassed initial expectations. Needs, which have ranged from satellite telephones and hand-held radio sets to vehicles, protective equipment, disinfectants, and specialized staff, have been rapidly communicated and immediately met.\n\nWHO and its partners are nonetheless prepared and organized to continue the outbreak response for several additional months, if this is needed. An important present goal is to transfer skills and responsibilities for outbreak response to national staff, and training efforts are under way with this goal in mind.",

In Uige Province, which remains the epicentre of the outbreak, 250 cases, of which 228 were fatal, were reported as of 20 April.\n\nA team of 28 Angolese health care professionals, assembled by the government, arrived today in Uige to provide further support to control activities. They have been assigned to work on infection control, surveillance for new cases, and the tracing and management of contacts, and are being trained and equipped for these tasks. The new staff will also join teams visiting communities within the affected municipalities in order to improve public understanding of the disease and acceptance of control measures. These teams are already supported by traditional community leaders, known as Sobas, and local volunteers.\n\nPublic understanding of the disease and participation in the outbreak response remain the most important factors influencing successful control. Activities needed to prevent further transmission within the hospital setting are well under way. In addition, protective gloves, soap, and instructions about the importance of their use have been provided to traditional healers and midwives.\n\nSignificant progress has been made in increasing the engagement of affected communities. Some cases and deaths have, however, continued to occur within the community. Efforts to rapidly isolate cases, shortly after symptom onset, and follow up contacts need to be further intensified.\n\nTeams investigating recent deaths within the community have determined that some families providing care in their homes are administering injections to patients. This practice carries a high risk and can perpetuate transmission within the community. Educational messages and materials communicating the associated dangers were developed today and will be added to the information already being provided to communities.\n\n\nImages from the outbreak of Marburg haemorrhagic fever in Uige Province, Angola 2005",

        "Description of the Situation": "15 April 2005\n\nData on cases of Marburg haemorrhagic fever in Angola are being reclassified and no nation-wide data can be reported today.\n\nDetailed data are available for Uige, the most severely affected province, where surveillance has been steadily improving. As of 14 April, 224 cases have been reported. Of these cases, 207 were fatal. Most cases have occurred in Uige municipality, which has reported 175 cases and 163 deaths. Much smaller numbers of cases have been reported from a further 7 municipalities in this province.\n\nImprovement of public understanding of the disease and acceptance of control measures has become one of the most urgent priorities. Today, meetings were held in the WHO office in Uige with traditional community leaders, known as Sobas, for all of Uige municipality. The governor of the province and the director of its health services have released the Sobas from their present duties for seven days so that they can accompany mobile surveillance and medical teams as they search for cases and collect bodies.\n\nThis decision is welcomed as an important step forward in achieving community acceptance of measures needed to bring the outbreak under control. WHO staff in Uige now plan to systematically extend the same procedures, using locally respected Sobas, to all other municipalities known to be affected by the disease. This plan is supported by the authorities.\n\nTraining to protect staff at the provincial hospital from infection and reduce the risk of transmission is continuing. Today, training was provided for 82 nurses in high-risk departments, including the maternity ward and the laboratory. Heads of departments and doctors were trained yesterday. Training for health staff in private clinics and for health workers in the police force is planned for early next week.\n\nIn response to an international appeal launched on 8 April, WHO has received pledges of funding, to support the outbreak response, from Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the European Commission Humanitarian Office (ECHO).",

        "Description of the Situation": "14 April 2005\n\nAs of 12 April, 235 cases of Marburg haemorrhagic fever have been reported in Angola. Of these cases, 215 have died. \n\nUige Province remains the most severely affected area, reporting a cumulative total of 208 cases and 194 deaths. The isolation ward at the province\u2019s large 400-bed hospital, which has been specially equipped and staffed for the care of Marburg patients, is empty, despite the fact that cases and deaths are known to be occurring in the community. It is apparent that, for the time being, the community does not accept the concept of isolation. Residents are unwilling to report suspected cases and allow these people to be managed under conditions that reduce the risk of further transmission.\n\nMeasures such as patient isolation and infection control that reduce opportunities for further transmission are the principal tools for bringing the outbreak under control. Given the urgency of the situation, WHO may temporarily introduce, as an emergency measure, a harm reduction strategy aimed at making a dangerous situation somewhat better. Family members and other caregivers who refuse to allow patients to be cared for in the isolation facility are being informed of ways to protect themselves from infection and given appropriate supplies. WHO has placed urgent orders for disinfectants, which are currently in short supply in Angola.\n\nToday, international staff drawn from the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network began training sessions for staff at the provincial hospital in the use of equipment and supplies to reduce the risk of infection in the health care setting. This training, which has been very well received, will continue through Saturday. Fever-screening units are being established to ensure that all persons admitted to hospital are initially screened for symptoms of Marburg haemorrhagic fever before being admitted to the general hospital wards.\n\nApart from continuing security concerns, another pressing problem is poor access to remote communities in Uige Province and correspondingly poor surveillance for cases in these areas. With the assistance of a military helicopter, international staff have begun pre-positioning supplies and equipment needed for outbreak control in these areas so that a response can be launched immediately should cases begin to occur.\n\nIn a tragic development, four Red Cross volunteers, freshly trained in social mobilization, were killed today by lightning while on their way to work. Support from Red Cross volunteers has been instrumental in controlling large outbreaks of the closely related Ebola haemorrhagic fever. WHO recognizes the importance of this support and deeply regrets the death of these volunteers.",

        "Description of the Situation": "13 April 2005\n\nAs of 11 April, 231 cases of Marburg haemorrhagic fever have been reported in Angola. Of these cases, 210 have died. Uige Province, with 202 cases and 190 deaths, remains the most severely affected area.\n\nThe present outbreak of Marburg haemorrhagic fever is unprecedented in its size and urban nature, and its dimensions are still unfolding. Although surveillance to detect cases has improved, it remains patchy. In Uige, where daily mobile teams are active, surveillance continues to be largely concentrated on the investigation of deaths and collection of bodies. The security of teams remains a concern. More vehicles are needed and WHO is making the necessary arrangements on an urgent basis.\n\nTo bring the outbreak under control, the detection and isolation of patients needs to be much earlier, but this will not happen until the public understands the disease and the high risks associated with treating patients in homes. Infection control needs to improve in heath care settings, and WHO is continuing to supply effective personal protective equipment, for both national and international staff, adapted to conditions in African countries.\n\nA welcome development is the decision by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies to strengthen its presence in Uige. Volunteers from these societies are part of a group of workers mobilized to conduct a door-to-door public information and education campaign in collaboration with community and church leaders and traditional healers. Today, workers received specialized training from experts in social mobilization and medical anthropology drawn from the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network. These workers have been rapidly deployed to deliver public talks at markets and schools.\n\nThe International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies has extensive experience in responding to emergencies in Africa and has been instrumental in bringing large outbreaks of Ebola under control. Because of this experience, workers from the Federation are usually viewed by communities as welcome help. WHO anticipates that this added and welcome support to response activities will help create greater acceptance of control measures and reduce high-risk behaviours.\n\nAdvice for travellers\n\nAll currently available data indicate that casual contact plays no role in the spread of Marburg haemorrhagic fever. Transmission requires extremely close contact involving exposure to blood or other bodily fluids from a patient who will most likely be showing visible signs of illness. The disease can also be transmitted following exposure to items, including bedding and clothing, recently contaminated by a patient.\n\nIn addition, transmission can occur in hospitals lacking adequate equipment and supplies for infection control and training in their proper use. The hospital system in Angola has suffered from almost three decades of civil unrest, and several cases of Marburg haemorrhagic fever have occurred in health care staff exposed during the treatment of patients in Uige.\n\nTo date, WHO is not aware of any cases of Marburg that have occurred in foreign nationals other than those involved in the care of cases in Uige.\n\nWHO does not recommend restrictions on travel to any destination within Angola, but does advise some precautions. Travellers to Angola should be aware of the outbreak of Marburg haemorrhagic fever and of the need to avoid close contact with ill persons. Persons with existing medical conditions who might require hospitalization should consider deferring non-essential travel to Angola, particularly to Uige Province.\n\nThose travelling to Angola for the purpose of working in health care settings should be fully informed regarding the outbreak of Marburg haemorrhagic fever, equipped with effective personal protective equipment, and trained in the procedures to prevent transmission in such settings.\n\nTravellers leaving Angola should be advised to seek medical attention should any illness with fever develop within 10 days of their departure. Information about recent travel to Angola should be included when symptoms are reported.\n\nHealth care workers and health authorities in countries neighbouring Angola should be aware of the symptoms of Marburg haemorrhagic fever and maintain vigilance for cases. Countries having close ties with Angola, necessitating frequent travel there by their citizens, may want to consider the introduction of measures to increase vigilance for potential symptoms in persons returning from Angola. In some cases, the introduction of screening procedures to identify potentially infected persons may be considered.\n\nWHO recommends that travellers with a clear exposure history be treated as contacts and placed under surveillance for 21 days, during which time their temperature should be monitored daily.",

Her condition deteriorated rapidly on 7 April, when she was taken to a district referral hospital and then transferred to Kuntha Bopha Hospital in Phnom Penh, where she died. Samples from the girl tested positive for avian influenza H5N1 virus at the Pasteur Institute, Phnom Penh.\n\nA field investigation was conducted immediately, with team members from the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Agriculture, WHO, Pasteur Institute and FAO. Poultry deaths occurred in this village in February, but no poultry deaths occurred in the two weeks prior to the girl\u2019s onset of symptoms. Human-to-human transmission as a source of the girl\u2019s infection appears unlikely, as none of her known contacts were sick with similar symptoms before she became ill. Investigations as to the source of the girl\u2019s infection are continuing.\n\nSamples were collected from four close contacts who cared for her at the village and nine medical contacts from Kampot and Phnom Penh. All have tested negative for the H5N1 virus.\n\nThe public education campaign in Banteay Meas and neighbouring districts is continuing.

Staff at Uige\u2019s large provincial hospital also need training and equipment to reduce the risk that routine surgical and laboratory procedures might endanger staff and other patients.\n\nAn isolation ward, dedicated to the care of Marburg haemorrhagic fever patients, has been established at this hospital by M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res.

Zaire Province has reported its first 6 cases, bringing the number of affected provinces to seven, all concentrated in the north-western part of the country.\n\nMobile surveillance teams in Uige were forced to suspend operations yesterday when vehicles were attacked and damaged by local residents. As the situation has not improved, no surveillance teams were operational today in this province, which remains the epicentre of the outbreak.\n\nWHO staff in Uige were notified today of several fatalities but teams were unable to investigate the cause of death or collect the bodies for safe burial. Discussions have been held with provincial authorities to find urgent solutions.\n\nThe dramatic symptoms of Marburg haemorrhagic fever and its frequent fatality are resulting in a high level of fear, which is further aggravated by a lack of public understanding of the disease. Moreover, because the disease has no cure, hospitalization is not associated with a favourable outcome, and confidence in the medical care system has been eroded.\n\nWHO is familiar with such reactions, which have been seen during previous outbreaks of the closely related Ebola haemorrhagic fever. Two medical anthropologists are already in Uige and will be joined shortly by experts in social mobilization from Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Mozambique. Public compliance with control measures is not expected to improve in the absence of intense campaigns to educate the public about the disease.\n\nIn African countries, the single most important factor in controlling viral haemorrhagic fevers is the engagement of affected communities as partners in control. To achieve this engagement, local belief systems about the causes of disease and traditional rituals for mourning the dead must be respected. When the public understands and accepts a few simple messages \u2013 avoid contact with blood and other fluids when caring for the ill, don\u2019t touch bodies of the deceased \u2013 transmission within the community can be stopped and the outbreak brought under control.\n\nInternational appeal\n\nSpecialized international staff and equipment have been deployed rapidly and measures are beginning to have an impact. Control of the outbreak will require intensified and sustained technical support from multidisciplinary teams, and additional materials and supplies. Provision of adequate personal protective equipment is a particularly urgent need. Increased field coordination of technical, operational and logistic support is likewise needed.\n\nToday, WHO has launched an appeal, through the United Nations, for funding to support the emergency response to this outbreak. WHO needs US$ 2.4 million to support the Ministry of Health, Angola to intensify ongoing operations in the field.\n\nTo reduce the risk of transmission in the community, priority activities include intensive social mobilization and health education in the towns and villages of Uige Province. To reduce the risk of transmission in health care facilities, priorities include the provision of personal protective equipment for front-line staff and essential supplies for infection control, including disinfectants. Additional activities that urgently need to be strengthened include the early detection and isolation of cases and the tracing and follow up of contacts.",

        "Description of the Situation": "7 April 2005\n\nAs of 6 April, 200 cases of Marburg haemorrhagic fever have been reported in Angola. Of these cases, 173 have died. Kuanza Sul has reported its first case, bringing the number of affected provinces to six, all concentrated in the north-western part of the country.\n\nInternational diagnostic and laboratory support\n\nFor laboratory work, Marburg virus has been classified as an extremely hazardous pathogen and can be handled safely only in specialized high-containment laboratories. WHO has established an international network of expert laboratories for the diagnosis of Marburg and other viral haemorrhagic fevers. Within this network, laboratories in Canada, Germany, South Africa, and the USA are providing diagnostic support for the Angolan outbreak. All have experience in working with Marburg virus.\n\nScientists from these laboratories are sharing test results and information on laboratory techniques in a virtual network and during weekly teleconferences. To ensure accurate tracking of the outbreak, members of the network are also standardizing methods for sample collection, testing, and the interpretation of results. The various diagnostic tests for Marburg haemorrhagic fever require skilled technical interpretation, as findings can vary according to the phase of the patient\u2019s illness, the way in which samples were taken, and the type of test used.\n\nIn Angola, a portable field laboratory is now operating in Uige and a second one should be operational in Luanda shortly. Field laboratories provide rapid and sufficiently reliable results for use during an outbreak, when decisions about appropriate case management and contact tracing need to be made quickly. The laboratory network is providing backup support for situations in which exceptionally precise diagnostic results are important because of the implications for control measures. Such situations include the possible exportation of a case to another country, and a suspected case in a person who may have placed numerous other people at unusually high risk.\n\nSophisticated laboratory studies of the virus may help shed some light on certain unusual features of the outbreak, including the high fatality rate and the overwhelming concentration of initial cases in children under the age of five years. In this regard, comparisons of the virus with strains from previous outbreaks may be instructive.\n\nA longer-term objective, whose achievement has long proved elusive, is to determine where Marburg virus hides in nature between outbreaks. Studies of viruses from Angola may offer some clues. Prior to the present outbreak, Angola was not considered to fall within the geographical \u201chot zone\u201d, thought to be in central and eastern Africa, for outbreaks and sporadic cases of this rare disease.\n\nLaboratories in the Marburg virtual network include:\n\nCanadian National Microbiology Laboratory,Winnipeg, Canada and field laboratory in Uige, Angola\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, Special Pathogen Branch, Atlanta, USA and field laboratory in Luanda, Angola\nBernhard-Nocht-Institut f\u00fcr Tropenmedizin, Hamburg, Germany\nInstitut f\u00fcr Virologie, Marburg, Germany\nNational Institute for Communicable Diseases of the National Health Laboratory, Special Pathogens Unit, Sandringham, South Africa.",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "6 April 2005\n\nAs of 5 April, the Angolan Ministry of Health has reported 181 cases of Marburg haemorrhagic fever. Of these, 156 have died. Cases have now been reported from five provinces. Uige remains the epicentre of the outbreak. While children under the age of 5 years initially accounted for around 75% of cases, recent cases are including an increasing number of adults.\n\nOne person is currently under investigation for Marburg haemorrhagic fever in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nAssessment of the outbreak\n\nWHO is concerned about the further evolution of the outbreak of Marburg haemorrhagic fever in Angola, and this concern is fully shared by the government. Following confirmation of Marburg virus as the causative agent, on 21 March, WHO sent its senior epidemiologists to Uige to assess the situation and organize an initial emergency response. That assessment prompted a rapid and massive augmentation of support in the form of international teams of specialized staff, presently in Uige and Luanda, and several shipments of supplies. Staff have been drawn from WHO and its partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN). Equipment to strengthen local diagnostic and communication capacity is also now in place.\n\nThis escalation of support is continuing, with the government making great efforts to facilitate the rapid influx of staff and supplies and set up the basic infrastructure for a sustained emergency response.\n\nWHO has acquired extensive experience in the successful control of viral haemorrhagic fevers, including Ebola, a closely-related disease that is clinically almost identical. Based on this experience, WHO remains confident that the outbreak can be brought under control. At the same time, however, the implementation of effective control measures faces several significant challenges, some of which may be unique to this outbreak.\n\nMarburg haemorrhagic fever is an extremely rare disease that remains poorly understood. Information on the behaviour of Marburg virus once it enters a human population is sparse. As detailed in a fact sheet recently issued by WHO, the outbreak in Angola is one of only two large outbreaks of this disease that have occurred in indigenous African populations since the virus was first detected in 1967. The only other large outbreak, which began in late 1998 in the Democratic Republic of Congo, was confined to two sparsely populated villages in an isolated corner of the country, caused sporadic cases with small chains of transmission over two years, and never reached the intensity of transmission seen in just the past few weeks in Angola. The outbreak in Angola is not only the largest on record, with the highest fatality, but is also the first to occur in an urban setting.\n\nAlmost three decades of civil unrest have left Angola with a severely weakened health infrastructure, a hospital system in dire need of basic equipment and supplies, inadequate communication and transportation systems, and a population weakened by economic hardship. These weaknesses hamper containment efforts, which depend on active surveillance for cases, rapid detection and isolation in specially designated and equipped facilities, and rapid tracing of contacts.\n\nBased on experiences with Ebola, control measures can have an immediate impact by interrupting chains of transmission. The eventual success of such measures depends on their sustained application, supported by efficient surveillance, and requires very good communication and transportation systems. Such systems are not presently available in Angola and cannot be established quickly. As another consequence of the country\u2019s recent history, hundreds of thousands of landmines are thought to remain in the country, making transportation by rail and road precarious and necessitating air transport of staff and equipment.\n\nIntensified surveillance in Uige over the past few days has determined that some patients are not being hospitalized and are dying within the community, creating an urgent need to organize services for the safe collection and burial of deceased persons.\n\nCases in health care workers point to the need to greatly increase supplies of protective equipment for front-line workers, particularly in hard-hit Uige and densely populated Luanda. WHO has arranged three shipments of this equipment to date; more shipments are on their way. Personal protective equipment is also being supplied by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res, and UNICEF. Nonetheless, supplies still fall short of the need. The symptoms of Marburg haemorrhagic fever, and its rapid fatality in the majority of cases, can cause great anxiety in affected populations. This anxiety increases the risk that people in affected areas may flee to other areas, thus fanning wider spread. Moreover, control measures are socially disruptive and may further increase public unease. In Uige, there is some evidence of a reluctance to seek treatment or remain under care in hospitals. Efforts are urgently needed to strengthen the hospital system, restore public confidence, and thus improve compliance with control measures.\n\nNumerous alerts are now being received each day, and teams from the Ministry of Health and WHO are being rapidly deployed to conduct investigations. Outcomes are reported daily by radio, and information about the evolution of the outbreak is improving.\n\nThe incubation period of this disease, which can be as short as 3 days, necessitates rapid and efficient contact tracing, and this has been made a priority. Good tracing and management of contacts helps to ensure that possible cases are isolated prior to the onset of symptoms, when the risk of transmission to others is highest. Other current priorities include the protection of front-line staff, strengthening of infection control in designated isolation wards, improved transportation of suspected cases to these wards, and public education to encourage protective behaviours and improve compliance with control measures.\n\nIn addition to these fundamental tasks, a top priority at present is to prevent the virus from establishing a foothold in densely populated urban or peri-urban parts of the country. For example, Uige, which is presently the epicentre of the outbreak, has around 500,000 inhabitants, but Luanda, where some cases have been reported, has a population close to 3 million. Response capacity in Luanda is being strengthened by the Ministry of Health, and WHO is increasing the number of international staff there as a support.\n\nInternational collaboration\n\nOver the past two weeks, WHO has provided support to the Ministry of Health from Headquarters, the Regional Office for Africa, and Country Offices in Angola and in Mozambique.\n\nGOARN partners and several additional organizations, working with the Ministry of Health to control the outbreak, are as follows:\n\nBernhard-Nocht-Institut f\u00fcr Tropenmedizin (BNI).

        "Description of the Situation": "29 March 2005\n\nViet Nam\n\nThe Ministry of Health in Viet Nam has confirmed three additional cases of human infection with H5N1 avian influenza. The cases concern a 5-year-old boy from the central province of Quang Binh, a 17-year-old girl from the northern province of Nam Dinh, and a 40-year-old woman from the northern province of Quang Ninh. The 17-year-old girl has died.\n\nAn earlier case has also been confirmed. These recently confirmed cases bring the total in Viet Nam since mid-December to 28.\n\nWHO is aware of reports of suspected H5 avian influenza infection in five members of a family who are presently hospitalized in the northern port city of Haiphong. These cases, which include the parents and their three young daughters, are undergoing further investigation following initial tests indicating infection with the H5 subtype of avian influenza. Reports indicate outbreaks of avian influenza in poultry in the vicinity. Field investigation of this family cluster is under way.\n\nThe current outbreak of human cases in Viet Nam has included several clusters, mostly in family members, of cases closely related in time and place. Thorough investigation of all such clusters is essential to determine possible changes in the behaviour of the virus and thus support assessment of the risk of an influenza pandemic.\n\nThere is currently no evidence that the H5N1 virus is spreading easily from person to person. Rapid sharing with WHO of viruses from recent clusters of cases has become increasingly important. Analysis can determine whether any significant changes in the virus have taken place and provide further support for risk assessment.\n\nSeveral media reports have recently covered rumours of a large outbreak of influenza-like illness in Quang Binh Province. The outbreak is presently under investigation by provincial and central health authorities. Samples have been taken for testing, and WHO is awaiting the results. The number of cases with influenza-like illness appears much smaller than initially reported by the media.\n\nCambodia\n\nThe Ministry of Health in Cambodia has today confirmed the country\u2019s second human case of avian influenza.\n\nThe 28-year-old man, from Kampot Province, developed symptoms on 17 March and was hospitalized in Phnom Penh on 21 March. He died on 22 March. The same day, laboratory tests by the Pasteur Institute in Phnom Penh confirmed that the man was infected with H5 avian influenza virus. The Cambodian government immediately launched an investigation to search for possible additional cases and identify possible sources of exposure to the virus. The investigation team, which is continuing its work in Kampot Province, includes Cambodian Ministry of Health and Ministry of Agricultural officials joined by staff from the WHO country office and the Pasteur Institute in Phnom Penh. FAO is assisting the investigation of animal disease. Numerous deaths among chickens in the area have been reported and samples taken from sick chickens have tested positive for avian influenza. The results from the investigation indicate the deceased man had contact with sick poultry. An 18 year-old boy initially identified as an additional suspected case has tested negative for the avian influenza virus. Samples taken from twenty seven other people, including family contacts of the confirmed case and Phnom Penh medical staff involved in his care, have all tested negative for H5 avian influenza infection. Results from a further six people from Kampot Province have also tested negative for H5 influenza virus.\n\nCambodia\u2019s previous case, a 25-year-old woman who died in late January, was also from Kampot Province but lived in another district.\n\nThe majority of poultry in Cambodia are raised in small backyard flocks in rural areas, making surveillance for outbreaks especially challenging. A campaign to educate rural populations about the dangers of contact with dead or diseased poultry is being undertaken by the government, with support from WHO.",

Rapid field investigation of each new case is essential to ensure timely detection of clusters of cases occurring in family members or health care workers. Such cases can provide the first signal that the virus is altering its behaviour in human populations and thus alert authorities to the need to intervene quickly.\n\nTotal human cases (all countries) since January 2004\n\nThe first human cases of H5N1 infection, linked to poultry outbreaks in parts of Asia that have been ongoing since December 2003, were reported in January 2004 in Viet Nam and Thailand. Since then, altogether 69 cases have been reported, of which 46 were fatal.\n\nHuman cases have occurred in three phases: from January through March 2004 (35 cases, 24 deaths), from August through October 2004 (9 cases, 8 deaths), and from December 2004 to the present (25 cases, 14 deaths).

This activity, which aimed to upgrade laboratory capacity and included a training component, involved the retesting in Tokyo of specimens from several persons initially classified in Viet Nam in January as negative for H5N1 infection. Retesting detected H5N1 in specimens from seven persons. WHO is awaiting further details about these cases, including outcomes. Upon receipt of this information, WHO will also include these cases in the cumulative total for Viet Nam.\n\nOne additional case in Viet Nam, dating back to February 2004, has been identified retrospectively from specimens stored as part of a study of encephalitis (see the New England Journal of Medicine, 2005, 352:686-691). H5N1 infection, which was not considered in the diagnosis of this fatal case, was identified in November 2004 when specimens were submitted to a battery of tests. Specimens collected from other patients in this study are now being systematically tested for possible H5N1 infection.\n\nInformation on new cases is of greatest concern and WHO continues to gather as much data as possible on each new case.

        "Description of the Situation": "26 January 2005\n\nThe Ministry of Health in Viet Nam has today reported two further laboratory confirmed cases of human infection with H5N1 avian influenza in Viet Nam.\n\nThe first newly reported case is a 35-year-old woman from the southern province of Dong Thap. She developed symptoms on 14 January, was admitted to hospital on 20 January, and died the following day.\n\nThe second newly reported case is a 17-year-old boy from the southern province of Bac Lieu. He was hospitalized on 10 January and died on 14 January.\n\nThese additional cases bring the total in Viet Nam since mid-December to ten. Nine of these cases were fatal.\n\nThe recent family cluster in northern Viet Nam As announced previously, a family cluster in northern Viet Nam has been the focus of intense investigation. The cluster involves three brothers. Of these, Vietnamese authorities have identified influenza A H5 infection in two: a 46-year-old man and his 42-year old brother. The older brother developed symptoms on 26 December and died on 9 January. The younger brother was hospitalized with respiratory symptoms on 12 January and has now fully recovered. He is known to have provided bedside care for his older brother during a period of critical illness.\n\nThe source of infection for the two brothers remains undetermined and investigations are ongoing. The third brother, aged 36 years, was hospitalized for observation only, did not develop symptoms, and remains in good health. Results of tests, conducted as part of the investigation, are pending. Clinical specimens for the two confirmed cases are being sent to a WHO collaborating centre for further characterization.\n\nSurveillance for further cases among health care workers, other family members, and residents in both communities where the brothers lived has so far found no evidence of additional cases. If limited human-to-human transmission has occurred, all evidence at this stage suggests that the chain of transmission ended after a single person was infected.\n\nPreventing transmission during care by family members\n\nFurther sporadic human cases and occasional family clusters can be expected considering the current spread of outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in poultry in some Asian countries. Experience to date indicates that possible human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly during prolonged close contact of a family member with a patient who was critically ill. WHO has issued guidance on the precautions that can be taken in health care facilities to minimize opportunities for transmission of H5N1 infection from patients to close contacts, including health care workers and family members.\n\nRapid detection and investigation of clusters of H5N1 cases, closely related in time and place, are key surveillance activities that can provide an early alert to possible changes in the transmissibility of the virus.",

        "Description of the Situation": "21 January 2005\n\nLaboratory results have confirmed avian influenza infection (H5 virus subtype) in two brothers in the northern part of Viet Nam. The first case, a 46-year-old resident of Thai Binh Province, developed symptoms on 1 January. He died on 9 January.\n\nAvian influenza \u2013 situation in Viet Nam \u2013 update 4\n\nHis 42-year-old brother, a resident of Hanoi, developed symptoms on 10 January, nine days after his brother fell ill. He remains hospitalized in Hanoi and is recovering. He is known to have provided bedside care for his brother, who was treated at the same hospital in Hanoi. The investigation surrounding the new cases is considering two hypotheses.\n\nThe first one includes the possibility that the 42-year-old man may have acquired his infection directly from his brother. All evidence to date suggests that isolated instances of limited, unsustained human-to-human transmission can be expected from avian influenza viruses in humans.\n\nTheir occurrence does not call for any change in the present level of pandemic alert. Intensified surveillance for respiratory symptoms in close contacts of the two men has been initiated in both Thai Binh Province and Hanoi and it is reassuring that no cases of respiratory illness have so far been detected among these people.\n\nHealth authorities in Viet Nam have launched an immediate investigation of the source of infection in the two brothers. WHO staff in that country are being kept closely informed.\n\nThe second hypothesis is focusing on a possible direct source of poultry-to-human transmission. Preliminary findings point to a family meal in which a dish containing raw duck blood and raw organs was served.\n\nPublic health officials in Viet Nam have repeatedly advised against the consumption of dishes made with fresh duck blood or with raw or inadequately cooked poultry products. As a precautionary measure, similar culinary practices involving dishes containing raw poultry parts or organs should be avoided in all countries experiencing outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in poultry.\n\nTo date, most human cases linked to contact with poultry are thought to have acquired their infection following exposure to dead or diseased birds around households. Evidence suggests that particularly risky exposure occurs during the slaughter, defeathering, and preparation of poultry for cooking.\n\nProper cooking destroys the H5N1 virus. In general, WHO recommends that poultry should be cooked until all parts reach an internal temperature of 70oC. No cases of H5N1 infection have been linked to the consumption of thoroughly cooked poultry and egg products.\n\nAvian influenza: food safety issues \n\nMedia reports that a third 35-year-old brother has been hospitalized have not been confirmed.\n\nThese latest two cases bring the total in Viet Nam since mid-December 2004 to eight. Of these, seven have died. The 18-year-old woman from Tien Giang Province, announced previously, died on 19 January.\n\nCumulative Number of Confirmed Human Cases of Avian Influenza A(H5N1) since 28 January 2004",

        "Description of the Situation": "13 January 2005\n\nThe Ministry of Health in Viet Nam has today confirmed the fourth case of H5N1 infection to occur in Viet Nam since December 2004. The patient is an 18-year-old woman from the southern province of Tien Giang. She developed symptoms on 1 January and was hospitalized on 5 January. She remains hospitalized in a critical condition. The three other H5N1 patients reported this year, who all resided in different provinces in southern Viet Nam, have died.\n\nThis latest case brings the total in Viet Nam, reported since January 2004, to 31 cases, of which 23 have been fatal.\n\nThe Vietnamese government today held a national meeting on avian influenza control to which prominent health and local government officials from all provinces of Viet Nam were invited, along with the representatives of WHO and FAO in Viet Nam. Participants were updated on the current avian influenza situation in animals and humans and provided with information and guidance on the intensified measures needed to control avian influenza in the run-up to the festivities of the Lunar New Year.\n\nTsunami in South-East Asia and the risk from avian influenza\n\nConcerns have been raised about whether the recent tsunami in South-East Asia may have increased the risk of an influenza pandemic. The level of pandemic risk depends on how widespread H5N1 is in domestic poultry, how often the virus is transmitted to humans, and the concurrent circulation of human influenza viruses. Areas with the highest prevalence of avian influenza were not directly affected by the tsunami, thus there is no inherent increased risk of the emergence of the pandemic strain due to the tsunami itself. However, any activity that spreads avian influenza increases the possibility of the emergence of a pandemic virus. The risk of importing avian influenza into areas affected by the tsunami can be minimized by controlling the movement of poultry from areas where outbreaks of avian influenza have occurred. It is also important to ensure that infected poultry are kept out of the food chain, including emergency food relief activities.",
