# Disease Outbreak Prediction and Data Retrieval

This repository contains a set of AWS Lambda functions designed for predicting disease outbreaks and retrieving related data. These functions leverage historical data to analyze and predict the frequency and locations of disease outbreaks, providing valuable insights for public health management. The functions include capabilities to predict the next disease outbreak date for a given country, find the frequency of diseases in a specific country over a given date range, identify the origin countries of a specified disease, and update the database with the latest disease outbreak information from the WHO website. Additionally, there are functions to retrieve and scrape data and process disease outbreak data from external APIs.
