        "Date Reported": "22 December 2017",
        "Location": "France",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 2 December 2017, an increase of cases infected with the Salmonella Agona strain was identified by health authorities in France in young children aged under six months. Subsequent investigations identified an outbreak of Salmonella enterica serovar Agona associated with infant formula products manufactured by the Lactalis Nutrition Sant\u00e9 group in France.As of 21 December, 35 confirmed cases of Salmonella Agona infections among infants aged less than six months have been identified in different regions of France. Sixteen infants have been hospitalized but all have fully recovered and no deaths have been reported. The outbreak was associated with consumption of four different brands of infant formula, including products designed for infants with special medical needs. On 10 December, Lactalis Nutrition Sant\u00e9 withdrew and recalled over 600 batches (more than 7000 tonnes) of implicated products that were manufactured from 15 February 2017 to present. The implicated infant formula products have been distributed internationally to more than 50 countries and territories. On 21 December 2017, Lactalis Group has conducted a new recall including all infant and nutritional products manufactured or packaged in the Craon plant since 15 February 2017. Efforts to trace the distribution of products included in this expanded recall are underway and will be communicated to affected countries through INFOSAN as they are identified.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "French authorities ordered the suspension of marketing and exports and the recall of several infant formula products manufactured by the Lactalis Nutrition Sant\u00e9 group since 15 February 2017. On 9 December, health authorities issued three alerts to pharmacists and health facilities in France to stop delivering the products concerned. Recommendations for possible appropriate substitutions are published on the website of the Ministry of Solidarity and Health (see link below).Recommendations by the French Society of PaediatricsAs of 15 December 2017, the recalled infant formula products have been exported to the following 48 countries (including France) and territories: Afghanistan, Algeria, Andorra, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Cameroon, China, Congo, Cyprus, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, France, Gabon, Georgia, Greece, Guinea, Haiti, Hong Kong SAR (China), Iraq, Kosovo1, Kuwait, Lebanon, Madagascar, Mali, Monaco, Morocco, Netherlands, Pakistan, Paraguay, Peru, Qatar, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Seychelles, Slovenia, Spain, Sudan, Switzerland, Taiwan (China), Togo, Turkey, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, Vietnam, Yemen, The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The products have also been distributed in the French overseas territories and departments.Working closely with the International Network of Food Safety Authorities (INFOSAN) Emergency Contact Point in France, the INFOSAN Secretariat has informed the INFOSAN Emergency Contact Points (and National IHR Focal Points) in the recipient countries outside of the European Union (EU) of the relevant distribution details to facilitate their investigations, recalls and risk management measures. Countries within the EU have been informed directly through the European Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF).",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Affected products present a risk for serious illness in infants (a susceptible at-risk group for serious disease and complications) that consume the product. Investigations are ongoing by French authorities to identify the outbreak\u2019s source. Similar outbreaks have happened previously, despite stringent control measures being in place. Past outbreaks have been related to other manufacturers and multiple geographical locations.Powdered infant formulas are not sterile products.\u00a0Salmonella\u00a0is prevalent in raw ingredients and can survive under harsh, dry conditions for lengthy periods of time. Preparing formula with tepid water can allow for rapid growth/multiplication of the initial low level\u00a0Salmonella\u00a0contamination, which may, in turn, cause serious illness and outbreaks among infants.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions on France based on the current information available on this event.If children who have consumed these products exhibit symptoms, such as diarrhoea with or without fever, parents are recommended to contact a doctor as soon as possible. Detected cases of\u00a0Salmonella\u00a0Agona should then be reported to national health authorities.Consumers are advised to follow the FAO/WHO guidelines for the safe preparation, storage and handling of powdered infant formula, available online (see link below).FAO/WHO guidelines on the safe preparation, storage and handling of powdered infant formulaIn case substitution of some of the affected formula is not available, the French authorities have recommended to heat the prepared formula for two minutes at 70\u00b0C and let it cool down to 37\u00b0C before serving it to infants. This would also inactivate\u00a0Salmonella\u00a0bacteria. This could be used as an interim practical solution until an appropriate replacement has been identified.For more information, please see the links below:WHO fact sheet on\u00a0SalmonellaList of recalled products: French health authorities recommend parents who still have boxes corresponding to these lots not to use them1 For the purposes of this publication, all references, including in the bibliography, to \"Kosovo\u201d should be understood/read as \u201cKosovo (in accordance with UN Security Council resolution 1244 (1999))\u201d",

        "Outbreak name": "Yellow fever",
        "Date Reported": "22 December 2017",
        "Location": "Nigeria",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 14 September 2017, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) informed WHO of a confirmed case of yellow fever in Kwara State. On 15 September, an official notification as per the International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005) was issued by the Nigerian National IHR Focal Point.The case-patient was a 7 year-old girl from Kwara State who developed symptoms on 16 August 2017 including fever, vomiting and abdominal pain. She had no previous history of yellow fever vaccination and no travel history outside of the state in the two years prior to illness onset. Her blood sample tested positive by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, and confirmed by serology tests performed at the regional reference laboratory, Institut Pasteur de Dakar (IPD).From 2 July through 19 December 2017, 341 suspected cases of yellow fever have been reported from 16 states, including Abia, Anambra, Borno, Edo, Enugu, Kano, Katsina, Kogi, Kwara, Kebbi, Lagos, Nasarawa, Niger, Oyo, Plateau, and Zamfara states. Six states have reported confirmed cases of yellow fever (Kano, Kebbi, Kogi, Kwara, Nasarawa and Zamfara). As of 19 December, a total of 213 samples have been tested in five laboratories in Nigeria. Of these 213 samples, the Nigerian laboratories tested 63 samples positive for yellow fever and there was one inconclusive result. Of 63 samples sent to IPD for laboratory confirmation of yellow fever infection, 32 were positive, 24 were negative, and 7 results are pending at the time of publication of this update.Of the 341 suspected cases, 214 (62.8%) are males. The most affected age group is people aged 20 years and younger who account for 65.9% of cases. The total number of deaths (among suspected, probable and confirmed cases) is 45 and nine among the confirmed cases. The case fatality rate for all cases (including suspected, probable and confirmed) is 21.1% and 28.1% for confirmed cases. Further epidemiological investigations are underway.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "The response to the outbreak is being coordinated by a multi-agency, multi-partner Incident Management Center and an Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) has been established to monitor the outbreak. An EOC has also been established in Kwara state and off-site support is being provided in Zamfara state. From 18 September through 20 October 2017, rapid response teams (including epidemiologists and entomologists) from NCDC and WHO were deployed to support local authorities investigate this event further in Kwara, Kogi, and Plateau states, to assess the risk of further amplification, and to assist in conducting reactive vaccination campaigns, among other activities. Surveillance for yellow fever has been intensified nationally and a one-week training course was conducted in Lagos to improve diagnosis of yellow fever and measles, with support from WHO. To strengthen laboratory capacity, a protocol for sample management and transport was developed and shared across states. A treatment facility was designated in Kwara state. Risk communication and social mobilization activities are being implemented including public information campaigns, radio messaging and community engagement through community leaders.Routine yellow fever vaccination was introduced to Nigeria\u2019s Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) in 2004, but the overall population immunity in areas affected by the current outbreak likely remains below herd immunity thresholds of 60\u201380%. Reactive vaccination campaigns targeting more than 800 000 people aged nine months to 45 years in priority communities of Kwara and Kogi states in October 2017 increased the coverage to 98% in targeted areas. A reactive vaccination campaign has also been concluded in four Local Government Areas of Zamfara state in December which vaccinated more than 1 000 000 persons. Another campaign is being conducted in five local government areas (LGAs); three in Kogi and two in Kwara states. Additionally, a pre-emptive mass campaign is planned to begin in February 2018; this campaign will initially target the six states with recently confirmed cases, followed by other priority states. This would be the next phase of a nationwide preventive campaign, planned to cover the entire country over the coming years. There is recognition that a nationwide approach is needed to achieve high levels of population immunity nationally.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Yellow fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease transmitted by mosquitoes and has the potential to spread rapidly and cause serious public health impact. There is no specific treatment, although the disease is preventable using a single dose of yellow fever vaccine, which provides immunity for life. Supportive care to treat dehydration, respiratory failure and fever, and antibiotic treatment for associated bacterial infections is recommended.Taking into consideration the reporting of suspected cases from 16 states and confirmed cases from six states, possible suboptimal immunisation coverage in affected communities, and in-country capacity to respond to sporadic cases and to conduct larger preventive campaigns (if warranted), WHO has assessed the overall risk at national level as high. There is currently a moderate risk of regional spread due to the proximity of affected states (Zamfara, and possibly Kebbi; approximately 400km from the border with Niger) and the low population immunity in this country (35.4%). The overall risk at the global level is low.The risk of the number of cases increasing depends in part on the density of vectors competent for sustained vector-borne transmission within human populations but no entomological information is currently available outside of Kwara. The region is entering the dry season and vector densities will be lower overall, but Aedes aegypti, which can amplify yellow fever outbreaks within human populations, is an anthropophilic vector which dwells in man-made containers around houses and is moderately affected by drier conditions.Nigeria is facing several concurrent public health emergencies, including cholera and Lassa fever outbreaks in other states, and a humanitarian crisis in the northeast of the country. The situation is being closely monitored.",
        "WHO Advice": "Vaccination and mosquito control are the primary means for prevention and control of yellow fever. WHO and partners will continue to support local authorities to implement these interventions to control the current outbreak.WHO recommends vaccination against yellow fever for all international travellers nine months of age and older going to Nigeria, as there is evidence of persistent or periodic yellow fever virus transmission. Nigeria also requires a yellow fever vaccination certificate for travellers over one year of age arriving from countries with risk of yellow fever transmission. Yellow fever vaccination is safe, highly effective and provides life-long protection. In accordance with the IHR (2005), Third edition, the validity of the international certificate of vaccination against yellow fever,using WHO approved vaccines , extends to the life of the person vaccinated. A booster dose of yellow fever vaccine cannot be required of international travellers as a condition of entry.WHO does not recommend any restrictions of travel and trade to Nigeria on the basis of the information available on this outbreak.For more information on yellow fever, please see the link below:WHO factsheet on yellow fever",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 29 October 2017, the WHO team in Sana\u2019a, Yemen received reports of suspected cases of Diphtheria from Ibb governorate. From 13 August through 21 December 2017, a total of 333 suspected cases including 35 deaths (case fatality ratio = 10.5%) have been reported from 20 governorates. In the absence of laboratory-confirmation, the current situation is being treated as an outbreak of suspected diphtheria based on clinical diagnosis.The majority of cases have been reported from Ibb Governorate (187 suspected cases). Seventy-nine percent of cases are less than 20 years old while 19% are children under 5 years old. There has been a similar number of male and female suspected cases (three suspected cases had no information about their sex). Sixty-one percent of the suspected cases have never received any vaccination against diphtheria.As of 21 December 2017, there were 35 deaths among suspected diphtheria cases. Fourteen of the deaths occurred in children under five years old.Figure 1: Number of suspected diphtheria cases and deaths by week of illness onset from 13 August through 21 December 2017Note: Date of onset is missing for 31 cases and 10 deaths and so are not included in this figureSource: Ministry of Public Health and Population (MoPHP)",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "The response has focused on providing guidance and support for the clinical management of cases and contacts, establishing referral pathways and isolation units, supporting laboratory confirmation of suspected cases, providing medicines and medical supplies, vaccinating children and young adults in high-risk areas, and engaging with communities on all aspects of the outbreak, including the treatment and prevention of diphtheria cases.Coordination and operations supportA Diphtheria Task Force has been activated to respond to the outbreak, comprising of the Ministry of Public Health and Population (MoPHP), WHO and UNICEF. The Task Force has assumed the leadership of the joint efforts to control this outbreak and focus on providing technical support to the affected districts.An Emergency Operating Center (EOC) has now been activated to provide an implementation platform for the response to diphtheria.Surveillance, case investigation and contact tracingWHO is supporting the training, equipment and deployment of teams in the most affected districts for active case detection and referral, identifying contacts and providing them antibiotics.WHO is working with the local authorities and partners to strengthen laboratory testing capacity, and for the collection of samples. As soon as MoPHP approvals are granted, samples will be transported to a WHO Collaborating Centre outside Yemen for confirmation.WHO is providing laboratory reagents to facilitate testing in-country.Case managementClinical management is being led by the MoPHP and partners. WHO is advising on guidelines for diagnosis and case management.WHO, UNICEF and MSF are working together to establish diphtheria treatment units in existing health facilities in the most affected districts including intensive care units for the management of severe cases. A referral system is being established to ensure suspected cases are identified, referred and treated promptly.WHO has delivered US$ 200 000 worth of antibiotics and 1000 vials of diphtheria antitoxin (DAT) to affected governorates, and hospital equipment for treatment units are being procured.WHO has supplied Yareem General Hospital with fuel, water, oxygen, equipment and medicines including DAT and antibiotics.VaccinationIn November, WHO, UNICEF and partners vaccinated 8500 children under five years of age in al-Saddah and Yarim districts in Ibb governorate, where the majority of cases were reported.The MoPHP, UNICEF and WHO are planning a vaccination campaign to immunize children aged six weeks to seven years old with pentavalent vaccines, and children and adults aged seven to 25 years old with tetanus/diphtheria (Td) vaccines (three rounds each).UNICEF is delivering 600 000 doses of pentavalent vaccine and three million Td vaccine doses. Further deliveries are planned every 2\u20133 weeks to reach a total of 2.1 million pentavalent and nine million Td vaccines.Social mobilization and community engagementBased on community assessments conducted by UNICEF, vaccination acceptance in Yemen is still very high.WHO is working with the MoPHP, UNICEF and MSF to develop a community engagement strategy to promote vaccine uptake, disseminate public health advice about diphtheria, and notify health care workers about how to refer suspect diphtheria cases for treatment.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Diphtheria is a vaccine-preventable disease caused by toxin- producing\u00a0Corynebacterium diphtheriae, transmitted from person to person through close physical and respiratory contact. Respiratory diphtheria is fatal in 5\u201310% of cases, with a higher mortality rate in young children. Treatment involves administering diphtheria antitoxin as well as antibiotics. Vaccination against diphtheria has reduced global mortality and morbidity of diphtheria dramatically in recent decades.The occurrence of an outbreak of diphtheria indicates insufficient coverage of the national childhood immunization programmes, combined with waning immunity in previously vaccinated individuals. With ongoing transmission, there is risk for further spread of the disease to neighboring countries with low vaccination coverage.Epidemiological surveillance for early detection of diphtheria outbreaks should be strengthened in Yemen. All countries in the region should have access to laboratory testing for reliable identification of toxin-producing\u00a0Corynebacterium diphtheriae. Adequate quantities of diphtheria antitoxins and antibiotics should be available nationally or regionally for the medical management of cases.The risk of further disease transmission is very high at the national level and high at the regional level because of several factors including ongoing armed conflict, an unprecedented cholera outbreak that has overwhelmed the health system, disrupted health services, limited healthcare workforce, lack of financial resources to run health facilities and to pay the salaries of health workers, and sub-optimal vaccination coverage. Additionally, there is a limited supply of diphtheria antitoxin at the global level and no reagents for laboratory confirmation at the country level. Medical supplies are in a chronic shortage despite extensive support from WHO and other health partners, further complicating the delivery of life-saving healthcare in the country.",

        "Date Reported": "21 December 2017",
        "Location": "Nigeria",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 20 September 2017, WHO was notified of a suspected outbreak of human monkeypox in Bayelsa State. Laboratory investigations have been conducted by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) National Reference Laboratory, Institut Pasteur de Dakar and the WHO Collaborating Center for orthopoxviruses, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC) in Atlanta.From 4 September through 9 December, 172 suspected and 61 confirmed cases have been reported in different parts of the country. Laboratory-confirmed cases were reported from fourteen states (out of 36 states)/territory: Akwa Ibom, Abia, Bayelsa, Benue, Cross River, Delta, Edo, Ekiti, Enugu, Lagos, Imo, Nasarawa, Rivers and Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Suspected cases were reported from 23 states/territories including: Abia, Adamawa, Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa, Benue, Cross River, Delta, Edo, Ekiti, Enugu, Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Imo, Kaduna, Kano, Katsina, Kogi, Kwara, Lagos, Ondo, Oyo, Nasarawa, Niger, and Rivers. The majority of cases are male (75%) and aged 21\u201340 years old (median age = 30 years old). One death has been reported in an immune-compromised patient not receiving anti-retroviral therapy. Clustering of cases has occurred within states, however there is no known evidence of epidemiological linkages across states. Further, genetic sequencing results of the virus isolated within and across states suggest multiple sources of introduction of the virus into the human population. Further epidemiological investigation is ongoing.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "The NCDC has deactivated its Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) and the response will be coordinated by a technical working group comprised of all existing response partners. The NCDC has also deployed rapid response teams (RRTs) to all states with confirmed cases and remote technical support is being provided by the NCDC to the other states. Surveillance, case investigation, and contact tracing are ongoing. The Surveillance and Outbreak Response Management System (SORMAS) was deployed on 4 November 2017 and is being used to enhance data management and real-time mapping of cases and contacts. Case management facilities, including isolation units, have been established and palliative care is being provided. Healthcare workers have been trained in case management and communication to the public regarding the risk of monkeypox has been communicated via mass media, dissemination of key messages, press releases, and media briefings.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Monkeypox, a rare zoonosis that occurs sporadically in forested areas of Central and West Africa, is an orthopoxvirus that can cause fatal illness. The disease manifestations are similar to human smallpox (eradicated since 1980), however human monkeypox is less severe. The disease is self-limiting with symptoms usually resolving within 14\u201321 days. Treatment is supportive. This is the first outbreak in Nigeria since 1978. The virus is transmitted through direct contact with blood, bodily fluids and cutaneous/mucosal lesions of an infected animals (rats, squirrels, monkeys, dormice, striped mice, chimpanzees amongst others rodents) Secondary human-to-human transmission is limited but can occur via exposure to respiratory droplets, contact with infected persons or contaminated materials.",
        "WHO Advice": "During monkeypox outbreaks, respiratory droplets and direct contact with body fluids, skin lesions of patients or objects as clothing recently contaminated by patient secretions or lesion fluids is the most significant risk factor for infection. In the absence of specific treatment or vaccine, the only way to reduce infection in people is by raising public awareness of the risk factors, such as close contact with wildlife animals including rodents, and educating people about the measures they can take to reduce exposure to the virus. Surveillance measures and rapid identification of new cases is critical for outbreak containment. Public health educational messages should focus on the following risks:Reducing the risk of animal-to-human transmission. Efforts to prevent transmission in endemic regions should focus on avoiding eating or touching animals that are sick of found dead in the wild. Gloves and other appropriate protective clothing should be worn while handling sick animals or their infected tissues.Reducing the risk of human-to-human transmission. People infected with monkeypox should be isolated and infection prevention and control measures should be implemented in healthcare facilities caring for infected patients. Close physical contact with persons infected with monkeypox should be avoided until they have recovered. Gloves, face masks and protective gowns should be worn when taking care of ill people in any setting. Regular hand washing should be carried out after caring for or visiting sick people.WHO advises against any restriction on travel or trade on Nigeria or the affected areas based on the available information. There is currently a low risk that international travellers would come into contact with monkeypox in Nigeria.For more information on monkeypox, please see the link below:WHO factsheet on monkeypox",

Fourteen of 15 deaths reported among suspected diphtheria cases were children younger than 15 years of age. To date, no cases of diphtheria have been reported from local communities.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "Since August 2017, more than 646 000 people from neighbouring Myanmar have gathered in densely populated camps and temporary settlements with poor access to clean water, sanitation and health services. A multi-agency diphtheria task force, led by the Ministry of Health Family Welfare of Bangladesh, has been providing clinical and public health services to the displaced population. WHO has mobilized US$ 3 million from its Contingency Fund for Emergencies (CFE) to support essential health services in Bangladesh.WHO is working with health authorities to provide tetanus diphtheria (Td) vaccines for children aged seven to 15 years, as well as pentavalent vaccines (diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus,\u00a0Haemophilus influenzae\u00a0type b, and hepatitis B) and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) for children aged six weeks to six years. A list of essential medicines and required supplies to support the response is being finalized by WHO and partners.The Serum Institute of India has donated 300 000 doses of pentavalent vaccines for use in the response.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "The current outbreak in Cox\u2019s Bazar is evolving rapidly. To date, all suspected cases have occurred among the displaced Rohingya population, who are living in temporary settlements with difficult and crowded conditions. The coverage of diphtheria toxoid containing vaccines among the displaced Rohingya population is difficult to estimate, although diphtheria outbreaks are an indication of low overall population vaccination coverage. Available vaccination data for Bangladesh indicates that the coverage of diphtheria toxoid containing vaccines is high. However, spillover into the local population cannot be ruled out. WHO considers the risk at the national level to be moderate and low at the regional and global levels.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO recommends timely clinical management of suspected diphtheria cases that is consistent with WHO guidelines consisting of diphtheria antitoxin, appropriate antibiotics and implementation of infection prevention and control measures. High-risk populations such as young children, close contacts of diphtheria cases, and health workers should be vaccinated on priority basis. A coordinated response and community engagement can reduce the risk of further transmission and help to control the outbreak.For more information on diphtheria, please see the link below:WHO fact sheet on diphtheria",

        "Description of the Situation": "From 1 January though 29 November 2017, a total of 3967 laboratory-confirmed and probable cases including 76 deaths (case fatality rate = 1.9%) were reported by the Ministry of Health to WHO. Of the cases reported, 596 were laboratory confirmed.Figure 1: Number of confirmed and probable cases in Kenya reported by week of illness onset from 1 January through 25 November 201711Date of illness onset is missing for 92 cases.From 1 January 2017 through 29 November, 20 of 47 counties (43%) in Kenya have reported cases. As of 29 November, seven counties continue to have active cholera outbreaks (Embu, Garissa, Kirinyaga, Mombasa, Nairobi, Turkana, and Wajir).The epidemiology of cholera for Kenya in 2017 is characterized by continuous transmission in affected communities coupled with outbreaks in camp settings and institutions or during mass gathering events. Continuous transmission in the community accounts for around 70% of the total cases with the majority of cases coming from the capital county, Nairobi. Transmission in camp settings occurred mainly within Garissa and Turkana counties, accounting for around 23% of the total reported cases. Both counties host big refugee camps, namely Dadaab and Kakuma refugee camps. Refugees in these camps come from countries currently experiencing complex emergencies and large cholera outbreaks. Seven percent of cases occurred in institutions and mass gathering events, where a number of people get infected from a point source. The country experiences cholera outbreaks every year; however, large cyclical epidemics occur approximately every five to seven years and last for two to three years.",

Since January 2017, WHO and other partners have been providing technical support to the country to control of the outbreak. Following the development of the national response plan, WHO and other partners supported the country to scale-up the outbreak response activities such as surveillance, case management, and social mobilization. This was also coupled with the improvement of food hygiene standards and promotion of safe food handling, besides scaling-up Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) related activities. This resulted in a decline in the number of cholera cases.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Despite the decline in the number of cases reported, the outbreak appears to be clustered around two major types of settings. First, the refugee camps particularly Kakuma and Dadaab, and second in the populous Nairobi capital county. Both settings are concerning, considering the overcrowded conditions and limited access to care in the first setting, and the high population density in the second setting. This could enable the spread of the outbreak to other districts. Also, previous outbreaks have shown that cases increase during the rainy season, which has started recently.In addition, various physical, social, political, and environmental factors increase the vulnerability and the susceptibility of the country\u2019s population to the cholera outbreaks. These include regional drought, conflict, and insecurity in the Horn of Africa, and the increased movement within and to the country by people fleeing conflicts in Somalia and South Sudan.Overall, the risk of the current outbreak is assessed as high at the national level and low at the regional and global levels.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO recommends proper and timely case management in cholera treatment centres. The affected communities should have improved access to water, effective sanitation, proper waste management, and enhanced hygiene and food safety practices. Key public health communication messages should be provided. WHO encourages travellers to the affected area to take proper hygiene precautions to prevent potential exposure.WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel and trade to Kenya based on the information available on the current outbreak.For more information on cholera, please see the link below:WHO fact sheet on cholera",

        "Date Reported": "24 November 2017",
        "Location": "Brazil",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "Between July and mid-October 2017, a total of 71 suspected yellow fever cases were reported in S\u00e3o Paulo State, Brazil. Of these, two were confirmed, six are under investigation, and 63 were ruled out. The two confirmed cases (one of which was fatal) were reported from Itatiba from 17 September through 7 October 2017.From July to early November, 580 epizootics in non-human primates (NHPs) were reported in S\u00e3o Paulo State, with an increase in the number of cases reported from 10 September 2017. Of these, 120 were confirmed for yellow fever, 233 are under investigation, 74 were classified as undetermined, and 153 were ruled out. The highest number of epizootics was registered in the health surveillance area of Campinas, where epizootic episodes were reported for the first time in the municipalities of Campo Limpo Paulista (in the week ending 23 September 2017), Atibaia (in the week ending 30 September 2017), and Jarinu (in the week ending 14 October 2017). Epizootics in NHPs were also recently reported in large parks located within the urban area of S\u00e3o Paulo City (in the week ending 14 October 2017).",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "The detection of two confirmed yellow fever human cases and epizootics in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, as well as confirmed yellow fever epizootics in the urban area of S\u00e3o Paulo City, prompted national authorities to begin vaccination campaigns in areas previously considered not at risk for yellow fever transmission. In addition, state and municipality health authorities are strengthening health care services and carrying out risk communication activities.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "These are the first human cases of yellow fever that have been reported in Brazil since June 2017. These cases, alongside the occurrence of epizootics in the urban area of S\u00e3o Paulo City and in municipalities that were previously considered not at risk for yellow fever, are a public health concern. Although Brazilian health authorities have swiftly implemented a series of public health measures in response to this event, including mass vaccination campaigns, it may take some time to reach optimal coverage in these areas given the large number of susceptible individuals. Currently, the number of unvaccinated people in S\u00e3o Paulo City remains high at around 10 million. If yellow fever transmission continues to spread to areas that were previously considered not at risk for yellow fever, ensuring the availability of vaccine and implementing control measures would pose significant challenges.To date, there has been no evidence of transmission by Aedes aegypti in relation to this outbreak in Brazil which began in 2016. Although entomological studies conducted in selected municipalities of S\u00e3o Paulo revealed low levels of Ae. aegypti and Aedes albopictus infestation (pupa index range: 0% \u2013 3.1%), the risk of sustained arbovirus transmission is ever present.The risk of spread at the regional level is considered to be low given the high vaccination coverage in neighbouring countries; however, the detection of a human case of yellow fever in Oiapoque, the border river between French Guiana and Brazil in August 2017 by French health authorities indicates that the risk of regional spread exists. The risk at the global level is considered to be low and limited only to unvaccinated travellers returning from affected areas. Travelers who return home while infected with yellow fever virus may increase the risk of establishing local cycles of yellow fever transmission in areas where the competent vector is present.WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and assess the risk according to the latest available information.",
        "WHO Advice": "Advice to travellers planning to visit areas at risk for yellow fever transmission in Brazil includes receiving yellow fever vaccine at least 10 days prior to traveling, following measures to avoid mosquito bites, and being aware of yellow fever symptoms and signs. WHO continues to promote health seeking behaviour when travelers are in and when they have returned from an area at risk for yellow fever transmission.As per Annex 7 of the International Health Regulations (2005), a single dose of yellow fever vaccine is sufficient to confer sustained immunity and life-long protection against yellow fever disease. Booster doses of yellow fever vaccine are not needed.The WHO Secretariat does not recommend any restrictions on travel or trade with/to Brazil according to the information currently available for this event.",

        "Date Reported": "15 November 2017",
        "Location": "Madagascar",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "Since 1 August 2017, Madagascar has been experiencing a large outbreak of plague. As of 10 November 2017, a total of 2119 confirmed, probable and suspected cases of plague, including 171 deaths (case fatality rate: 8%), have been reported by the Ministry of Health of Madagascar to WHO.From 1 August through 10 November 2017, 1618 (76%) cases and 72 deaths have been clinically classified as pneumonic plague, including 365 (23%) confirmed, 573 (35%) probable and 680 (42%) suspected cases. In addition to the pneumonic cases, 324 (15%) cases of bubonic plague, one case of septicaemic plague, and 176 unspecified cases (8%), have been reported to WHO (Figure 1). Eighty-two healthcare workers have had illness compatible with plague, none of whom have died.Figure 1: Number of confirmed, probable and suspected plague cases in Madagascar reported by date of illness onset from 1 August through 10 November 2017 (n=2119)11 Date of onset is missing for 295 casesFrom 1 August through 10 November, 16 (out of 22) regions of Madagascar have reported cases. Analamanga Region has been the most affected, reporting 72% of the overall cases (Figures 2 and 3). Figure 2: Geographical distribution of confirmed and probable pneumonic plague cases in Madagascar from 1 August through 12 November 2017Figure 3: Geographical distribution of confirmed and probable bubonic plague cases in Madagascar from 1 August through 12 November 2017As of 10 November 2017, 218 out of 243 (90%) contacts under follow-up were reached and provided with prophylactic antibiotics. Since the beginning of the outbreak, a total of 7122 contacts were identified, 6729 (95%) of whom have completed their 7-day follow up and a course of prophylactic antibiotics. Only nine contacts developed symptoms and became suspected cases. Laboratory confirmation of plague is being conducted by the Institut Pasteur of Madagascar, National WHO Collaborating Center for plague in Madagascar. Twenty-five isolates of Yersinia pestis have been cultured and all are sensitive to antibiotics recommended by the National Program for the Control of Plague.The number of new cases and hospitalizations of patients due to plague is declining in Madagascar. The last confirmed bubonic case was reported on 24 October and the last confirmed pneumonic case was reported on 28 October. Since plague is endemic to parts of Madagascar, WHO expects more cases to be reported until the end of the typical plague season in April 2018. It is therefore important that control measures continue through to the end of the plague season.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "The Ministry of Public Health of Madagascar is coordinating the health response, with the support of WHO and other agencies and partners.The Ministry of Public Health of Madagascar has activated crisis units in Antananarivo and Toamasina and all cases and contacts have been provided access to treatment or prophylactic antibiotics at no cost to themselves.Public health response measures include:Investigation of new casesIsolation and treatment of all pneumonic casesEnhanced case findingActive finding, tracing and monitoring of contacts and provision of free prophylactic antibioticsStrengthened epidemiological surveillance in the all affected districtsDisinsection, including rodent and vector controlRaising public awareness on prevention for bubonic and pneumonic plagueRaising awareness among health care workers and providing information to improve case detection, infection control measures and protection from infectionProviding information about infection control measures during burial practices.Enhanced measures for exit screening have been implemented at the International Airport in Antananarivo. These measures include: filling a special departure form at the airport (to identify passengers at risk); temperature screening of departing passengers, and referring passengers with fever to airport physicians for further consultation; passengers with symptoms compatible with pneumonic plague are immediately isolated at the airport and investigated using a rapid diagnostic test and notified according to the response alert protocol. Symptomatic passengers are not allowed to travel. A WHO GOARN team, consisting of US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and L'Institut de veille sanitaire/ Sant\u00e9 publique France (InVS/SPF), is providing technical support at the airport.Nine countries and overseas territories in the African region (Comoros, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mauritius, Mozambique, La R\u00e9union (France), Seychelles, South Africa, and Tanzania) have been identified as priority countries for plague preparedness and readiness by virtue of their trade and travel links to Madagascar. These countries are implementing readiness activities, including increased public awareness of plague, enhancing surveillance for the disease (particularly at points of entry), and prepositioning of equipment and supplies.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Since mid-October, the number of new cases of plague, the number of hospitalizations of patients due to plague, and the number of geographic districts reporting plague has decreased. While the declining trend in new plague case reports and reduction in hospitalizations due to plague are encouraging signs, WHO expects more cases of plague to be reported from Madagascar until the typical plague season ends in April 2018.The decline in case reports suggests that the epidemic phase of the outbreak is ending, however sustaining ongoing operations is critical to minimize bubonic plague infections and human-to-human transmission of pneumonic plague.The trend in the number of new cases of plague has been declining for more than a month, indicating that measures taken to contain the outbreak have been effective. WHO is working with the Ministry of Health in Madagascar and other partners to maintain ongoing outbreak control efforts, including active case finding and treatment, comprehensive contact identification, follow-up and antibiotic treatment, rodent and flea control, and safe and dignified burials through this outbreak and the plague season into 2018, and to outline a longer term strategy for plague preparedness and control.Since the beginning of this outbreak, the vast majority of cases, and more than 7000 contact persons, have been treated and have recovered. As of 15 November 2017, only 12 people are hospitalized for plague. There has been no international spread outside the country.Based on available information and response measures implemented to date, WHO estimates the risk of potential further spread of the plague outbreak at national level remains high. The risk of international spread is mitigated by the short incubation period of pneumonic plague, implementation of exit screening measures and advice to travellers to Madagascar, and scaling up of preparedness and operational readiness activities in neighbouring Indian Ocean islands and other southern and east African countries. The overall global risk is considered to be low. WHO is re-evaluating the risk assessment based on the evolution of the outbreak and information from response activities.Advice on prevention and control measures and treatment options has been provided to Madagascar and to priority countries in the region.",
        "WHO Advice": "Based on the available information to date, the risk of international spread of plague appears very low. WHO advises against any restriction on travel or trade on Madagascar. To date, there are no reported cases related to international travel.International travellers arriving in Madagascar should be informed about the current plague outbreak and the necessary protection measures. Travellers should protect themselves against flea bites, avoid contact with dead animals, infected tissues or materials, and avoid close contact with patients with pneumonic plague. In case of sudden symptoms of fever, chills, painful and inflamed lymph nodes, or shortness of breath with coughing and/or blood-tainted sputum, travellers should immediately contact a medical service. Travellers should avoid self-medication, even if for prophylaxis. Prophylactic treatment is only recommended for persons who have been in close contact with cases, or with other high risk exposures (such as bites from fleas or direct contact with body fluids or tissues of infected animals). Upon return from travel to Madagascar, travellers should be on alert for the above symptoms. If symptoms appear, travellers should seek medical care and inform their physician about their travel history to Madagascar.",

        "Location": "Uganda and Kenya",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 17 October 2017, the Ugandan Ministry of Health (MoH) notified WHO of a confirmed outbreak of Marburg Virus Disease in Kween District, Eastern Uganda. The MoH officially declared the outbreak on 19 October 2017. As of 14 November, three cases have been reported including two confirmed cases, and one probable case. All three cases have died, resulting in a case fatality rate of 100%. The cases were epidemiologically linked and all belong to the same family.Chronologically, the first case (probable) was a 35-years-old herdsman who frequently hunted near the area of Kaptum, known for its bat-infested caves. He was admitted to hospital on 20 September with Marburg-like symptoms and died five days later. The first confirmed case was the sister and caretaker of the first case. The second confirmed case was the brother of the first two cases, who died on 26 October 2017 and had a safe and dignified burial on the same day. Prior to his death, the second confirmed case travelled to Kenya where he visited his relatives in West Pokot County, as well as a traditional healer in Trans Nzoia County. On 29 October 2017, the Ugandan MoH notified WHO and the Kenyan MoH of these high-risk contacts. The traditional healer tested negative for Marburg virus disease on repeated blood specimen analyses performed at the Kenyan Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) in Nairobi. She and her family were monitored for 21 days. The two relatives from West Pokot, as well as other contacts in the same county, also completed their 21 days of follow up. Active case search, death surveillance, safe and dignified burials and community mobilization are ongoing in Kween and Kapchorwa districts. In Uganda, of the 339 contacts listed, 283 have completed 21 days of follow-up and 56 are still being monitored. Contact follow-up is ongoing in Kween for the 56 contacts, while In Kapchorwa District, all the listed contacts have completed the 21 days follow-up period. All remaining contacts are expected to complete 21 days of follow up on 16 November 2017. Enhanced surveillance activities will continue until 7 December 2017.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "The Ugandan MoH continues to proactively respond to the outbreak with support from WHO and partners.Contact tracing and active case search in health facilities and at the community level are ongoing. On 14 November 2017, 56 contacts were still under follow up. Reported deaths are also investigated for Marburg before burial and suspicious deaths are buried according to safe and dignified burial protocols.Two Marburg treatment centers have been set up in Kapchorwa hospital and Kaproron with logistical support from M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) France, UNICEF and WHO.Social mobilization and risk communication are ongoing. Over 12 000 community members have received information on Marburg virus disease with the support from Red Cross volunteers, UNICEF and WHO communication experts.Psychosocial support specialists have been deployed to Kween and counselling sessions are being conducted for family members of the deceased Marburg cases, health workers, and other community members.Guided tours of the Marburg treatment units in Kapchorwa and Kaproron were organized in order to dispel fear of the treatment centers and rumours of wrong practices by healthcare workers that cause deaths among admitted patients.On 7 November 2017, a cross-border meeting between Uganda and Kenya health authorities was organized to strengthen cross-border surveillance in Kapchorwa, and cross-border surveillance activities are ongoing.The Kenyan Marburg virus disease outbreak contingency plan and the public health Emergency Operations Center have been activated and preparedness measures have started.Two thousand Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) kits have been dispatched by WHO and shipped to Trans Nzoia County, Kenya.A temporary treatment center (Kaisangat Health center) has been identified and the Kenya Red Cross Society is recruiting and re-orienting nurses to manage the Marburg Virus Disease treatment centre.UNICEF is assisting with communication activities and community engagement.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Marburg virus disease is an emerging and highly virulent epidemic-prone disease associated with high case fatality rates (CFR: 23 to 90%). Marburg virus disease outbreaks are rare. The virus is transmitted by direct contact with the blood, body fluids and tissues of infected persons or wild animals (e.g. monkeys and fruit bats).Candidate experimental therapeutics are being reviewed for potential clinical trials.As of 15 November, the current outbreak has affected three cases, all of whom have died. One of the confirmed cases travelled to Kenya prior to his death. However, so far no secondary case has been confirmed outside of Uganda.Uganda has previous experience in managing recurring Ebola and Marburg virus disease outbreaks. Cases have historically been reported among miners and travellers who visited caves inhabited by bat colonies in Uganda. Kenya on the other hand has limited experience and has been facing a healthcare worker strike which could delay any public health response. Cross-border population movement and community mixing between Uganda and Kenya may increase the risk of cross-border spread.Ugandan health authorities have responded quickly to this event, and measures are being rapidly implemented to control the outbreak. Kenyan health authorities have activated the contingency plan and the public health EOC and have started preparedness measures. The high number of potential contacts in extended families, at healthcare facilities and surrounding traditional burial ceremonies was a challenge for the response.The affected districts are in a rural, mountainous area located on the border with Kenya, about 300km northeast of Kampala on the northern slopes of Mount Elgon National Park. The Mount Elgon caves are a major tourist attraction, and are host to large colonies of cave-dwelling fruit bats, known to transmit the Marburg virus. The close proximity of the affected area to the Kenyan border, and cross-border movement between the affected district and Kenya and the potential transmission of the virus between bat colonies and to humans, increases the risk of cross-border spread.These factors suggest a high risk at national and regional level, requiring an immediate, coordinated response with support from international partners. Tourism to Mount Elgon, including to the caves and surrounding areas, should be considered as part of the response, and appropriate advice provided, and precautions taken. The risk associated with the event at the global level is low.",
        "WHO Advice": "Human-to-human transmission of Marburg virus is primarily associated with direct contact with blood and body fluids, of infected symptomatic persons, and Marburg virus transmission associated with provision of health care has been reported when appropriate infection control measures have not been observed.Health-care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed Marburg virus should apply infection control precautions to avoid any exposure to blood and body fluids, and unprotected contact with possibly contaminated environment.Surveillance activities, including contact tracing and active case search must be strengthened within all affected health zones.Raising awareness of the risk factors for Marburg infection and the protective measures individuals can take to reduce human exposure to the virus, are the key measures to reduce human infections and deaths. Key public health communication messages include:Reducing the risk of bat-to-human transmission arising from exposure to mines or caves inhabited by fruit bats colonies. During work or research activities or tourist visits in mines or caves inhabited by fruit bat colonies, people should wear gloves and other appropriate protective clothing (including masks).Reducing the risk of human-to-human transmission in the community arising from direct or close contact with infected patients, particularly with their body fluids. Close physical contact with Marburg patients should be avoided. Gloves and appropriate personal protective equipment should be worn when taking care of ill patients at home. Regular hand washing should be performed after visiting sick relatives in hospital, as well as after taking care of ill patients at home.Communities affected by a Marburg outbreak should make efforts to ensure that the population is well informed about the nature of the disease , both to avoid community stigmatization, and to encourage early presentation to treatment centres and to support other necessary outbreak containment measures, including burial of the dead. People who have died from Marburg virus disease should be buried promptly, safely, and with dignity.Restrictions of international travelWHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions on Uganda or the affected area based on the current information available on this event. Travelers to the Mount Elgon bat caves are advised to avoid exposure to fruit bats and contact with non-human primates, and, to the extent possible, to wear gloves and protecting clothing, including masks.A media signal about quarantine measures being implemented by Kenya on the border with the affected areas in Uganda was verified; the signal was not confirmed by the health authorities in Kenya.Kenya on high alert after a suspected Marburg case near Uganda borderNo other signals were detected in relation to travel measures against Uganda or Kenya due to the current Marburg virus disease outbreak.For further information on Marburg virus disease and prevention and control measures is available on the WHO website Marburg virus and in the WHO Marburg virus disease factsheet.Website on Marburg virus diseaseFact sheet on Marburg virus disease",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 1 November, the International Health Regulations (2005) national focal point of Oman reported one case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. Prior to this case, the most recent case of MERS-CoV from Oman was reported on 30 August 2017.Details of the caseThe patient, a 27-year-old male living in Sharqiyah Region, reported contact with dromedaries prior to symptom onset. Details of the case reported to WHO can be found in a separate document (see link below). MERS-CoV case reported on 1 November 2017xls, 209kb\nGlobally, 2103 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV including at least 733 related deaths have been reported to WHO.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "Investigations are ongoing into the source of infection and exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. The Ministry of Agriculture has been informed and investigations into dromedaries are ongoing. Contact tracing and follow up of 10 family contacts and all health care workers at the hospital/s where the patient was treated are ongoing. All identified contacts are monitored for 14 days from the last date of exposure.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "MERS-CoV causes severe human infections resulting in high mortality and has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings. Close direct or indirect contact with infected dromedaries is the source of human infections in the community.The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to animals or animal products (for example, following contact with dromedaries) or human source (for example, in a health care setting). WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.",
        "WHO Advice": "Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because, like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.Community and household awareness of MERS and MERS prevention measures in the home may reduce household transmission and prevent community clusters.Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS-CoV infection. Therefore, in addition to avoiding close contact with suspected or confirmed human cases of the disease, people with these conditions should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be or potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.",

        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Marburg virus disease is an emerging and highly virulent epidemic-prone disease associated with high case fatality rates (case fatality rate: 23\u201390%). Marburg virus disease outbreaks are rare. The virus is transmitted by direct contact with the blood, body fluids and tissues of infected persons or wild animals (e.g. monkeys and fruit bats).Candidate experimental treatments and vaccine are being reviewed for potential clinical trials.Uganda has previous experience in managing recurring Ebola and Marburg virus (MVD) disease outbreaks. MVD cases have historically been reported among miners and travellers who visited caves inhabited by bat colonies in Uganda. Marburg virus disease outbreaks have been documented during:2007 \u2013 4 cases, including 2 deaths in Ibanda District, Western Uganda;2008 \u2013 2 unrelated cases in travellers returning to the Netherlands and USA, respectively after visiting caves in Western Uganda;2012 \u2013 15 cases, including 4 deaths in Ibanda and Kabale districts, Western Uganda; and2014 \u2013 1 case in healthcare professional from Mpigi District, Central Uganda.Currently, three cases have been identified; two confirmed and one probable case. The second confirmed case travelled to Kenya prior to his death, but so far no human-to-human transmission has been confirmed outside of Uganda. Ugandan health authorities have responded rapidly to this event, and measures are being rapidly implemented to control the outbreak. Kenyan health authorities have activated the contingency plan and the public health EOC and have started preparedness measures. The high number of potential contacts in extended families, at healthcare facilities and surrounding traditional burial ceremonies is a challenge for the response.The affected districts are in a rural, mountainous area located on the border with Kenya, about 300km northeast of Kampala on the northern slopes of Mount Elgon National Park. The Mount Elgon caves are a major tourist attraction, and are host to large colonies of cave-dwelling fruit bats, known to transmit the Marburg virus. The close proximity of the affected area to the Kenyan border, and cross-border movement between the affected district and Kenya and the potential transmission of the virus between colonies and to humans, increases the risk of cross-border spread.These factors suggest a high risk at national and regional level, requiring an immediate, coordinated response with support from international partners. Tourism to Mount Elgon including the caves and surrounding areas should be noted and appropriate advice given and precautions taken. The risk associated with the event at the global level is low.",
        "WHO Advice": "Human-to-human transmission of Marburg virus is primarily associated with direct contact with blood and body fluids of infected symptomatic persons, and Marburg virus transmission associated with provision of health care has been reported when appropriate infection control measures have not been observed.Health-care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed Marburg virus should apply infection control precautions to avoid any exposure to blood and body fluids, and unprotected contact with possibly contaminated environment.Surveillance activities, including contact tracing and active case search must be strengthened within all affected health zones.Raising awareness of the risk factors for Marburg infection and the protective measures individuals can take to reduce human exposure to the virus, are the key measures to reduce human infections and deaths. Key public health communication messages include:Reducing the risk of bat-to-human transmission arising from prolonged exposure to mines or caves inhabited by fruit bats colonies. During work or research activities or tourist visits in mines or caves inhabited by fruit bat colonies, people should wear gloves and other appropriate protective clothing (including masks).Reducing the risk of human-to-human transmission in the community arising from direct or close contact with infected patients, particularly with their body fluids. Close physical contact with Marburg patients should be avoided. Gloves and appropriate personal protective equipment should be worn when taking care of ill patients at home. Regular hand washing should be performed after visiting sick relatives in hospital, as well as after taking care of ill patients at home.Communities affected by Marburg should make efforts to ensure that the population is well informed, both about the nature of the disease itself to avoid community stigmatization, and encourage early presentation to treatment centres and other necessary outbreak containment measures, including burial of the dead. People who have died from Marburg should be promptly and safely buried.WHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions on Uganda or the affected area based on the current information available on this event. Travelers to the Mount Elgon bat caves are advised to avoid exposure to fruit bats and contact with non-human primates, and, to the extent possible, to wear gloves and protecting clothing, including masks.For further information on MVD and prevention and control measures is available:Website on Marburg virus diseaseFact sheet on Marburg virus disease",

        "Date Reported": "7 November 2017",
        "Location": "Saudi Arabia",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "Between 27 September and 31 October 2017, the National IHR Focal Point of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia reported 12 additional cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, including two deaths. Additionally, one death from a previously reported case was reported to WHO.Details of the casesDetailed information concerning the cases reported can be found in a separate document (see link below).MERS-CoV case reported between 27 September and 31 October 2017xlsx, 59kb\nThe 12 cases of MERS-CoV infection reported during this time period are from six regions of the country. Among the 12 cases, nine reported contact with dromedaries and none have reported an epidemiological link with other known cases. Investigations into the source of infection for each case, including direct and/or indirect contact with dromedaries, are ongoing.Globally, 2102 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV including at least 733 related deaths have been reported to WHO.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "The source of infection for each case reported is under investigation by the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Agriculture (when dromedaries are involved) in Saudi Arabia. The Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health has identified and is following up health care workers and household contacts of known MERS patients.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "MERS-CoV causes severe human infections resulting in high mortality and has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings. Close direct or indirect contact with infected dromedaries is the source of human infections in the community.The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to animals or animal products (for example, following contact with dromedaries) or human source (for example, in a health care setting). WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.",
        "WHO Advice": "Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because, like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.Community and household awareness of MERS and MERS prevention measures in the home may reduce household transmission and prevent community clusters.Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS-CoV infection. Therefore, in addition to avoiding close contact with suspected or confirmed human cases of the disease, people with these conditions should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be or potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.",

        "Location": "Burkina Faso",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "Burkina Faso has been reporting an increase in the number of dengue fever cases in health facilities since week 31 of 2017 (week ending on 6 August 2017). The Ministry of Health officially declared the outbreak on 28 September 2017.As of 3 November 2017, a total of 9 029 (suspected, probable or confirmed) cases and 18 deaths (CFR= 0.2%) were reported throughout the country. Of the total cases reported, 5773 (64%) were probable, with a positive result for dengue by the rapid diagnostic test (RDT). During week 43 of 2017, 2 566 cases (including 1427 probable) were reported across all regions.Out of 241 samples referred for PCR testing at the Viral Haemorrhagic fever (VHF) reference lab of the Centre Muraz, Bobo-Dioulasso, 141 (59%) were positive. Further characterization of 72 samples has identified three dengue virus serotypes: DENV-2 (58 positives), DENV-3 (12 positives) and DENV-1 (2 positives). Cases are currently reported in all the 13 health regions of the country, with 60.8% of cases reported in the central region, particularly in the city of Ouagadougou.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "The National Epidemic Management Committee has been activated to coordinate response activities.Strengthening the epidemiological surveillance, and putting in place an Early Warning System that provides daily notification of cases in Ouagadougou and weekly in the other provinces.Provision of free medical care and treatment for severe cases in all hospitals (Regional and District hospitals). 15 000 RDTs distributed to reference health centers.Development and dissemination of a national dengue clinical management algorithm.Delivery and dissemination of key awareness and prevention measures through radio and television programs.Periodic shipment of samples to the VHF laboratory of the Centre Muraz, Bobo-Dioulasso.Implementation of intensive vector control interventions targeting larva and adult mosquitoes through.Elimination of mosquito breeding sites which was carried out by community volunteers in Ouagadougou;Distribution of 1 500 Long Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLINs) to hospitals;Ongoing in-door spraying to control adult mosquitoes at the household level.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "This outbreak is occurring in the context of an improved but still limited dengue surveillance system in Burkina Faso. The weekly case incidence has been on the rise since the detection of the outbreak in week 31 and is likely underestimated. The epidemic has already spread to twelve of the country's thirteen health zones and many public health facilities do not have access to dengue fever diagnostics (RDTs).Burkina Faso experienced an outbreak of dengue in 2016 which was caused by DENV-2. In the current outbreak, three serotypes were identified: DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-3. This could lead to the occurrence of more severe cases, which may not be captured by the surveillance system due to under-reporting from private clinics and healthcare centers in peripheral districts.The existence of multiple mosquito breeding sites after the rainy season may favor the continued presence of mosquito populations in the affected communities In particular, the peripheral districts of cities in Burkina Faso are characterized by poor sanitation and the accumulation of rubbish dump sites, tires and used containers which provide productive breeding sites for\u00a0Aedes aegypti\u00a0mosquitoes (the primary vector for dengue).",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO recommends adequate and timely case management dengue cases. Surveillance should be strengthened within all affected health zones. Key public health communication messages should be provided. Integrated Vector Management (IVM) activities should be enhanced to remove potential breeding sites, reduce vector populations and minimize individual exposures. This should include both vector control strategies (i.e. environmental management, and chemical and biological control measures), as well as strategies to protect individuals and households. For further information, see:Vector control strategiesWHO recommends that countries should consider the introduction of the dengue vaccine CYD-TDV only in geographic settings (national or subnational) where epidemiological data indicate a high burden of disease. Complete recommendations may be found in the WHO position paper on dengue vaccines:WHO position paper on dengue vaccinepdf, 437kbWHO advises against any restriction on travel and trade to Burkina Faso or the affected district based on the available information.CORRIGENDUM: Updates were made to the numbers and text in the first 3 paragraphs.",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "Since August 2017, Madagascar is experiencing a large outbreak of plague affecting major cities and other non-endemic areas.From 1 August through 30 October 2017, a total of 1801 confirmed, probable and suspected cases of plague, including 127 deaths, have been reported by the Ministry of Health of Madagascar to WHO. Of these, 1111 (62%) were clinically classified as pneumonic plague, including 257 (23%) confirmed, 374 (34%) probable and 480 (43%) suspected cases. In addition to the pneumonic cases, 261 (15%) cases of bubonic plague, one case of septicaemic plague and 428 cases (24%) where the type has not yet been specified, have been reported (Figure 1). As of 30 October, 51 of 114 districts of Madagascar have been affected (Figure 2 and 3). Since the beginning of the outbreak, 71 healthcare workers have had illness compatible with plague, none of whom have died. Laboratory confirmation of plague is being conducted by the Institut Pasteur of Madagascar. Twenty-three isolates of Yersinia pestis have been cultured and all are sensitive to antibiotics recommended by the National Program for the Control of Plague. Since the second week of October 2017, there has been a decline in the number of new cases (Figure 4). There is also a decrease in the number of patients hospitalized due to suspicion of plague. Due to enhanced surveillance and ongoing investigations the cumulative number of cases continues to increase, however, some of the cases are not recently infected.In Madagascar, the number of cases of plague is highest during the period of September through April. It is therefore important that control measures continue through to the end of April 2018. Eighty-three percent of 6492 individuals identified as contacts of a person suspected of having plague have completed follow-up monitoring, which includes a seven day follow-up and a course of prophylactic antibiotics. On 30 October 2017, 95% of the 972 contacts currently under follow-up were reached by field teams and have been provided with antibiotics as precautionary measure. Figure 1.

        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "The Ministry of Public Health of Madagascar is coordinating the health response, with the support of WHO, and other agencies and partners.The Ministry of Public Health of Madagascar has activated crisis units in Antananarivo and Toamasina and all cases and contacts have been provided access to treatment or prophylactic antibiotics at no cost.Public health response measures include:Investigation of new casesIsolation and treatment of all pneumonic casesEnhanced case findingActive finding, tracing and monitoring of contacts and provision of free prophylactic antibioticsStrengthened epidemiological surveillance in the all affected districtsDisinsection, including rodent and vector controlRaising public awareness on prevention for bubonic and pneumonic plagueRaising awareness among health care workers and providing information to improve case detection, infection control measures and protection from infectionProviding information about infection control measures during burial practices.Enhanced measures for exit screening have been implemented at the International Airport in Antananarivo. These measures include: filling a special departure form at the airport (to identify passengers at risk); temperature screening of departing passengers, and referring passengers with fever to airport physicians for further consultation; passengers with symptoms compatible with pneumonic plague are immediately isolated at the airport and investigated using a rapid diagnostic test and notified according to the response alert protocol. Symptomatic passengers are not allowed to travel. A WHO GOARN team (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and L'Institut de veille sanitaire/ Sant\u00e9 publique France (InVS/SPF) is providing technical support at the airport.Nine countries and overseas territories in the African region (Comoros, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mauritius, Mozambique, La R\u00e9union (France), Seychelles, South Africa, and Tanzania) have been identified as priority countries for plague preparedness and readiness by virtue of their trade and travel links to Madagascar. These countries are implementing readiness activities including increased public awareness of plague, enhancing surveillance for the disease particularly at points of entry and prepositioning of equipment and supplies.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "While the declining trend in new plague case reports and reduction in hospitalizations due to plague is encouraging, WHO expects more cases of plague to be reported from Madagascar until the typical plague season ends in April 2018. Sustaining ongoing operations, including active case finding and treatment, comprehensive contact identification, follow-up and antibiotic treatment, rodent and flea control, and safe and dignified burials is crucial during the outbreak and through the plague season as it is critical to minimize bubonic plague infections and human-to-human transmission of pneumonic plague.Based on available information and response measures implemented to date, WHO estimates the risk of potential further spread of the plague outbreak at national level remains high. The risk of international spread is mitigated by the short incubation period of pneumonic plague, implementation of exit screening measures and advice to traveller to Madagascar, and scaling up of preparedness and operational readiness activities in neighbouring Indian Ocean islands and other southern and east African countries. The overall global risk is considered to be low. WHO is re-evaluating the risk assessment based on the evolution of the outbreak and information from response activities.Advice on prevention and control measures, treatment options have been provided to Madagascar and to priority countries in the region.For further information on plague and the latest information about the plague outbreak in Madagascar please see WHO Plague website and the Madagascar Plague Outbreak Situation Reports website.WHO Plague websiteMadagascar Plague Outbreak Situation Reports website",
        "WHO Advice": "Based on the available information to date, the risk of international spread of plague appears very low. WHO advises against any restriction on travel or trade on Madagascar based on the information available.International travellers arriving in Madagascar should be informed about the current plague outbreak and the necessary protection measures. Travellers should protect themselves against flea bites, avoid contact with dead animals, infected tissues or materials, and avoid close contact with patients with pneumonic plague. In case of sudden symptoms of fever, chills, painful and inflamed lymph nodes, or shortness of breath with coughing and/or blood-tainted sputum, travellers should immediately contact a medical service. Travellers should avoid self-medication, even if for prophylaxis. Prophylactic treatment is only recommended for persons who have been in close contact with cases, or with other high risk exposures (such as bites from fleas or direct contact with body fluids or tissues of infected animals). Upon return from travel to Madagascar, travellers should be on alert for the above symptoms. If symptoms appear, travellers should seek medical care and inform their physician about their travel history to Madagascar.",

For more information, see the latest situation report available from: \n\n\nPlague outbreak situation reports \n\n\nOn 10 October 2017, the Seychellois Ministry of Health notified WHO of a probable case of pneumonic plague. The probable case had visited Madagascar and returned to Seychelles on 6 October 2017. He developed acute respiratory symptoms on 9 October 2017 and presented to a local health centre. Based on a medical examination and reported history of recent travel to Madagascar, pneumonic plague infection was suspected and he was immediately referred to hospital where he was isolated and treated. \n\nOn 11 October 2017, a rapid diagnostic test was performed in country on a sputum sample and was weakly positive. From 9 through 11 October 2017, eight of his contacts developed mild symptoms and were isolated. Two other suspected cases, with no travel history to Madagascar and no established epidemiological link to the probable case, were also identified, isolated and placed on treatment. \n\nTen samples from suspected cases, including the probable case, were collected and sent to the Institut Pasteur Paris and all tested negative on 17 October 2017.\n\n13 October was the last day of monitoring of over 320 contact persons of the probable case, including 41 passengers and seven crew members from the flight, 12 close family members, and 18 staff and patients from the health centre visited by the probable case. All were provided a prophylactic course of antibiotics to prevent the disease. \n\nOverall, a total of 1223 contacts had been registered and were followed up. Of these, 833 contacts were given prophylactic antibiotics. Four suspected cases were identified from among the contacts and were put on treatment. \n\nFollowing the negative test results from Institut Pasteur Paris, all contacts who were isolated in the hospital, including the probable case, have been discharged. Antibiotic prophylaxis to the identified contacts, including monitoring of their health for symptom development has been discontinued. \nPublic health response\n\nA Crisis Emergency Committee was established on 10 October 2017, to coordinate surveillance, contact tracing, case management, isolation and supplies. \n\nThe government has allocated funds to support the Committee interventions, enabling the setting up of a temporary isolation ward (whilst the existing ward is expanded), procurement of key supplies, contact tracing, and expansion of contact tracers\u2019 training. \n\nAir Seychelles flights to and from Madagascar had been stopped on 8 October 2017 to reduce likelihood of further importation of plague cases from Madagascar. WHO does not recommend restrictions on travel and trade. Since 10 October 2017, the Madagascar Ministry of Health, with support from WHO, has implemented exit screening at the international airport in Antananarivo to prevent international spread. Further support from WHO and partners is being planned to strengthen measures at points of entry to avoid international spread. \n\nWHO is advising the Government of Seychelles on the implementation of public health measures that are in line with the WHO International Health Regulations, such as enhanced surveillance, isolation and treatment of suspect cases, contact tracing and prophylactic treatment of potential contacts.\nWHO risk assessment\n\nPlague is a treatable infectious disease caused by Yersinia pestis, a zoonotic bacterium, usually found in small mammals and their fleas. Humans can be contaminated by the bite of infected fleas, through direct contact with infected materials or animals or by inhalation.\n\nThere are three main forms of plague infection, depending on the route of infection: bubonic, septicaemic and pneumonic.\n\nPneumonic plague is the most virulent form of plague and can trigger severe epidemics through person-to-person transmission via respiratory droplets. Incubation period can be as short as 24 hours. Typically, the pneumonic form is caused by spread to the lungs from advanced bubonic plague. However, a person can acquire primary pneumonic from a symptomatic pneumonic plague patient by inhalation of infectious respiratory droplets. Plague is a preventable and treatable disease; however, untreated pneumonic plague is always fatal. \n\nPlague has never been reported in Seychelles, and at this stage, no plague cases have been confirmed in Seychelles. None of the previously reported probable or suspected cases have died. The Seychelles Government has established precautionary measures including, enhanced surveillance, isolation and treatment of suspect cases, contact tracing and prophylactic treatment of potential contacts, and screening at major ports of entry. Training of additional healthcare workers and volunteers in contact tracing was conducted on 17 October 2017 with WHO support. The risk of pneumonic plague in the Seychelles is considered as low and the overall regional and global risk levels as very low.\nWHO travel advice \n\nAt this stage, Seychelles has not confirmed any plague case on its territory, and there is a very low risk that international travellers would come into contact with plague in Seychelles. WHO advises against any restriction on travel or trade on Seychelles or Madagascar based on the available information. \n\nOn 3 October 2017, WHO published advice for international travellers in relation to the outbreak of plague in Madagascar, which should also be followed for travellers to Seychelles. \n\n\nPlague - MadagascarInformation for international travellers\n\n\n\nOn 11 October, the Ministry of Health announced several measures against pneumonic plague in a press release on its website. As many of these measures significantly interfere with international traffic, on 13 October, the Ministry of Health informed WHO that it will provide the scientific evidence and public health rationale for these measures, as required by Article 43.3 of the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005). \n\n\n\n\nMeasures reinforced to contain pneumonic plagueMinistry of Health, Republic of Seychelles \n\nInternational Health Regulations (2005)\n\n\n\nFor further information on plague, including prevention measures, please visit the WHO Plague website. \n\n\nPlague",

Thus the government at national and local level continues to take preventive measures which include:Guiding the provinces to strengthen surveillance to ensure timely and effective detection and response to outbreaks.Guiding the provinces to make use of the present low-incidence period to review the prevention and control efforts taken, to facilitate implementation of long-term measures.Continuing to carry out risk communication and issue information notices to provide the public with guidance on self-protection.The agricultural sector has started to extensively vaccinate poultry with influenza A(H5) and A(H7) bivalent vaccines.The government has cautioned provinces that infection prevention and control cannot be treated lightly, and that they should stay alert to ensure that cases can be identified and managed in a timely and effective manner.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "As seen in previous years, the number of weekly reported cases has decreased over the summer months. The number of human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus and the geographical distribution in the fifth epidemic wave (i.e. onset since 1 October 2016) however has been greater than earlier waves. This suggests that the virus has spread, and emphasizes that further intensive surveillance and control measures in both the human and animal health sector remain crucial.Most human cases are exposed to avian influenza A(H7N9) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, including live poultry markets. Since the virus continues to be detected in animals and environments, and live poultry vending continues, further human cases can be expected. Additional sporadic human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) in provinces in China that have not yet reported human cases are also expected. Similarly, sporadic human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) detected in countries bordering China would not be unexpected. Although small clusters of cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported, including those involving patients in the same ward, current epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans. Therefore the likelihood of further community level spread is considered low.Close analysis of the epidemiological situation and further characterization of the most recent viruses are critical to assess associated risk and to adjust risk management measures in a timely manner.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should, if possible, avoid poultry farms, contact with animals in live poultry markets, entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water, and follow good food safety and food hygiene practices.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions, with regard to this event. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling in, or soon after returning from, an area where avian influenza is a concern.WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and influenza-like illness (ILI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns; ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR 2005; and continue national health preparedness actions.",

        "Date Reported": "25 October 2017",
        "Location": "Uganda",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 17 October 2017, the Ugandan Ministry of Health notified WHO of a confirmed outbreak of Marburg virus disease in Kween District, Eastern Uganda. The Ministry for Health officially declared the outbreak on 19 October 2017.As of 24 October, five cases have been reported \u2013 one confirmed case, one probable case with an epidemiological link to the confirmed case, and three suspected cases including two health workers.Chronologically, the first case-patient (probable case) reported was a male in his 30s, who worked as a game hunter and lived near a cave with a heavy presence of bats. On 20 September, he was admitted to a local health centre with high fever, vomiting and diarrhoea, and did not respond to antimalarial treatment. As his condition deteriorated, he was transferred to the referral hospital in the neighbouring district, where he died the same day. No samples were collected. He was given a traditional burial, which was attended by an estimated 200 people. The sister (confirmed case) of the first case-patient nursed him and participated in the burial rituals. She became ill and was admitted to the same health centre on 5 October 2017 with fever and bleeding manifestations. She was subsequently transferred to the same referral hospital, where she died. She was given a traditional burial. Posthumous samples were collected and sent to the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI). On 17 October, Marburg virus infection was confirmed at UVRI by RT-PCR and it was immediately notified to the Ministry of Health.The third case-patient (suspected case) is the brother of the first two cases. He assisted in the transport of his sister to the hospital, and subsequently became symptomatic. He refused to be admitted to hospital, and returned to the community. His whereabouts are currently not known though there is an ongoing effort to find him. Two health workers who were in contact with the confirmed case have developed symptoms consistent with Marburg virus disease and are under investigation (suspected cases). Laboratory results to rule out Marburg virus disease are pending.Contact tracing and follow-up activities have been initiated. As of 23 October, 155 contacts including 66 who had contact with the first case and 89 who had contact with the second case-patient have been listed in the two affected districts, including 44 health care workers. The number of family and community contacts is still being investigated.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "The Ugandan Ministry of Health has rapidly responded to the outbreak, with support from WHO and partners. A rapid response field team was deployed to the two affected districts within 24 hours of the confirmation.To coordinate response activities, the National Task Force has convened, an Incident Management System (IMS) framework implemented with an Incident Manager appointed, a District Task Force has been established, and an emergency rapid response plan has been developed.Marburg virus disease response activities have been initiated, including surveillance, active case search, contact tracing and follow-up, as well as monitoring within affected communities and healthcare centres.Personal protective equipment has been deployed in the affected districts. Healthcare workers have been put on high alert and training sessions are planned, including a thorough review of infection prevention and control (IPC) protocols and capacity. An isolation facility is being prepared at the health centre and the hospital.Training of teams for safe and dignified burials has been conducted in affected districts.Community engagement and awareness campaigns are ongoing to reduce stigma, encourage reporting and early healthcare seeking behaviours, and acceptance of prevention measures. Information, education and communication materials and messages have been updated and are being produced.International partners and stakeholders have been engaged at country level, and internationally to provide support and technical assistance for the response as needed. WHO has deployed additional staff, and six viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF) kits. Funding has been provided from the WHO Contingency Fund for Emergencies to ensure immediate support and scale up the response. WHO has alerted partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), and is coordinating international support for the response.UNICEF is assisting with communication activities, and community engagement.M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res has deployed to support setting up of treatment centres.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Marburg virus disease is an emerging and highly virulent epidemic-prone disease associated with high case fatality rates (case fatality rate: 23\u201390%). Marburg virus disease outbreaks are rare. The virus is transmitted by direct contact with the blood, body fluids and tissues of infected persons or wild animals (e.g. monkeys and fruit bats).Candidate experimental treatments and vaccine are being reviewed for potential clinical trials.Uganda has previous experience in managing recurring viral haemorrhagic fever outbreaks including Marburg virus disease. Cases have historically been reported among miners and travellers who visited caves inhabited by bat colonies in Uganda. Marburg virus disease outbreaks have been documented during:2007 \u2013 4 cases, including 2 deaths in Ibanda District, Western Uganda;2008 \u2013 2 unrelated cases in travellers returning to the Netherlands and USA, respectively after visiting caves in Western Uganda;2012 \u2013 15 cases, including 4 deaths in Ibanda and Kabale districts, Western Uganda; and2014 \u2013 1 case in healthcare professional from Mpigi District, Central Uganda.As of 24 October, five cases have been identified \u2013 one confirmed case, one probable case, and three suspected cases, and the outbreak remains localised. Ugandan health authorities have responded rapidly to this event, and measures are being rapidly implemented to control the outbreak. The high number of potential contacts in extended families, at healthcare facilities and surrounding traditional burial ceremonies is a challenge for the response. In addition, hospitalised cases were handled in general wards without strict infection control precautions, and one probable case refused to be hospitalised for a period of time.The affected districts are in a rural, mountainous area located on the border with Kenya, about 300km northeast of Kampala on the northern slopes of Mount Elgon National Park. The Mount Elgon caves are a major tourist attraction, and are host to large colonies of cave-dwelling fruit bats, known to transmit the Marburg virus. The close proximity of the affected area to the Kenyan border, and cross-border movement between the affected district and Kenya and the potential transmission of the virus between colonies and to humans, increases the risk of cross-border spread.These factors suggest a high risk at national and regional level, requiring an immediate, coordinated response with support from international partners. Tourism to Mount Elgon including the caves and surrounding areas should be noted and appropriate advice given and precautions taken. The risk associated with the event at the global level is low.",
        "WHO Advice": "Human-to-human transmission of Marburg virus is primarily associated with direct contact with blood and body fluids, and Marburg virus transmission associated with provision of health care has been reported when appropriate infection control measures have not been observed.Health-care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed Marburg virus should apply infection control precautions to avoid any exposure to blood and body fluids, and unprotected contact with possibly contaminated environment.Surveillance activities, including contact tracing and active case search must be strengthened within all affected health zones.Raising awareness of the risk factors for Marburg infection and the protective measures individuals can take to reduce human exposure to the virus, are the key measures to reduce human infections and deaths. Key public health communication messages include:Reducing the risk of bat-to-human transmission arising from prolonged exposure to mines or caves inhabited by fruit bats colonies. During work or research activities or tourist visits in mines or caves inhabited by fruit bat colonies, people should wear gloves and other appropriate protective clothing (including masks).Reducing the risk of human-to-human transmission in the community arising from direct or close contact with infected patients, particularly with their body fluids. Close physical contact with Marburg patients should be avoided. Gloves and appropriate personal protective equipment should be worn when taking care of ill patients at home. Regular hand washing should be performed after visiting sick relatives in hospital, as well as after taking care of ill patients at home.Communities affected by Marburg should make efforts to ensure that the population is well informed, both about the nature of the disease itself to avoid community stigmatization, and encourage early presentation to treatment centres and other necessary outbreak containment measures, including burial of the dead. People who have died from Marburg should be promptly and safely buried.WHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions on Uganda or the affected area based on the current information available on this event. Travellers to the Mount Elgon bat caves are advised to avoid exposure to bats and contact with non-human primates, and, to the extent possible, to wear gloves and protecting clothing, including masks .For further information on Marburg virus disease and prevention and control measures is available in the WHO Marburg virus disease factsheet.WHO Marburg virus disease factsheet",

        "Location": "Seychelles",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "Madagascar is experiencing a large outbreak of plague affecting major cities and other non-endemic areas since August 2017. This outbreak caries a moderate risk of spread to neighbouring Indian Ocean islands. This risk has been mitigated by the short incubation period (the time from exposure to onset of symptoms) of pneumonic plague and the institution of exit screening measures at the airport and other major ports. For more information, see the latest situation report available from:Plague outbreak situation reports On 10 October 2017, the Seychellois Ministry of Health notified WHO of a probable case of pneumonic plague. The probable case is a 34-year-old man who had visited Madagascar and returned to Seychelles on 6 October 2017. He developed symptoms on 9 October 2017 and presented to a local health centre. Based on a medical examination and reported history of recent travel to Madagascar, pneumonic plague infection was suspected and he was immediately referred to hospital where he was isolated and treated. A rapid diagnostic test (RDT) preformed within the country on 11 October on a sputum sample was weakly positive. Since then he has been treated as a probable case until confirmation by a WHO plague reference laboratory is completed. The specimen is being sent to Institut Pasteur in Paris, France for confirmation. The patient continues to be hospitalized in isolation until completion of the antibiotic treatment. He is currently asymptomatic and in stable condition. Between 9 and 11 October 2017, eight of his contacts developed mild symptoms and have been isolated. Two other suspected cases, without any established epidemiological link to the probable case, have also been identified isolated and are on treatment. In total 10 laboratory specimens have been collected from the probable case, his contacts and the two suspected cases and are being shipped to Institut Pasteur in France for testing. October 13 was the last day of monitoring of over 320 contact persons of the probable case, including 41 passengers and seven crew from the flight, 12 close family members, and 18 staff and patients from the health centre visited by the probable case. All were provided a prophylactic course of antibiotics to prevent the disease. In addition, 577 children and 63 teachers in potential contact with one of the individual identified by contact tracing were given antibiotics as a prophylaxis precautionary measure. Thus contact tracing is done thoroughly.\nCurrently only eleven (11) close contacts and one foreign national who was not in contact with the probable case but recently arrived from Madagascar, are hospitalised as precautionary measure and will remain in the hospital on treatment although they do not present signs of respiratory distress.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "A Crisis Emergency Committee was established on 10 October, and has since then, been meeting daily to coordinate surveillance, contact tracing, case management, isolation and supplies.A hotline was revived on 12th October.The Government has allocated funds to support the Committee interventions, enabling the setting up of a temporary isolation ward (whilst the existing ward is expanded), procurement of key supplies, contact tracing, and expanded contact tracers training next week, etc.Air Seychelles flights to-from Madagascar were stopped from 8 October to reduce likelihood of further importation of cases from Madagascar.WHO does not recommend restrictions on travel and trade, based on the currently available information.On 10 October 2017, Madagascar Ministry of Health, with support from WHO, has implemented exit screening at the international airport in Antananarivo to prevent international spread. Further support from WHO and partners is being planned to strengthen measures at points of entry to avoid international spread.WHO has deployed three epidemiologists and one risk communication officer to support the Country Office and Ministry of Public Health in responding to the current situation.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Plague is an infectious disease caused by the bacteria\u00a0Yersinia pestis, a zoonotic bacterium, usually found in small mammals and their fleas. Humans can be contaminated by the bite of infected fleas, through direct contact with infected materials or animals or by inhalation.There are three forms of plague infection, depending on the route of infection: bubonic, septicaemic and pneumonic.Pneumonic plague is the most virulent form of plague and can trigger severe epidemics through person-to-person contact via droplets in the air. Incubation period can be as short as 24 hours. Typically, the pneumonic form is caused by spread to the lungs from advanced bubonic plague. However, a person with secondary pneumonic plague may form aerosolized infective droplets and transmit plague to other humans. Plague is treatable disease; however, untreated pneumonic plague is always fatal.Plague has never been reported in Seychelles, and at this stage, no cases have been definitively confirmed. The case reported above being considered as probable until final classification according to the laboratory results that will be performed at Institut Pasteur in Paris.The Seychelles Government has established precautionary measures including, enhanced surveillance, isolation and treatment of suspect cases, contact tracing and prophylactic treatment of potential contact.The risk of further spread in the Seychelles (should the case be confirmed) is considered as low and the overall regional and global risk levels as very low.",
        "WHO Advice": "At this stage, there is a very low risk international travellers would come into contact with plague in Seychelles. WHO advises against any restriction on travel or trade on Seychelles or Madagascar based on the available information.On 3 October 2017, WHO published advice for international travellers in relation to the outbreak of plague in Madagascar, which should also be followed for travellers to Seychelles.Plague - MadagascarInformation for international travellersOn 11 October, the Ministry of Health announced several measures against pneumonic in a press release on its website. As many of these measures significantly interfere with international traffic, on 13 October, the Ministry of Health informed WHO that it will provide the scientific evidence and public health rationale for these measures, as required by Article 43.3 of the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005).Measures reinforced to contain pneumonic plagueMinistry of Health, Republic of SeychellesInternational Health Regulations (2005)For further information on plague, including prevention measures, please visit the WHO Plague website.Plague",

        "Description of the Situation": "Between 31 August and 26 September 2017, the national IHR focal point of Saudi Arabia reported nine additional cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), including four deaths. In addition, four deaths from previously reported cases were reported.Details of the casesDetailed information concerning the cases reported can be found in a separate document (see link below).MERS-CoV cases reported between 31 August and 26 September 2017xlsx, 53kb\nAmong the nine newly reported cases, one was associated with a MERS cluster in Dawmet Aljandal City, Al Jawf region, Saudi Arabia reported previously.Globally, 2090 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV including at least 730 related deaths have been reported to WHO.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "The source of infection of the cases reported are under investigation by the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Agriculture (when dromedaries are involved) in Saudi Arabia. The Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health has identified and is following up health care workers and household contacts of known MERS patients. As per Saudi Arabian policy, listed contacts were not allowed to attend Hajj.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "MERS-CoV causes severe human infections resulting in high mortality. Close direct or indirect contact with infected dromedaries is the main source of primary human infections. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings.The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to animals or animal products (for example, following contact with dromedaries) or human source (for example, in a health care setting).WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.",
        "WHO Advice": "Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.Community and household awareness of MERS and MERS prevention measures in the home may reduce household transmission and prevent community clusters.Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS-CoV infection. Therefore, in addition to avoiding close contact with suspected or confirmed human cases of the disease, people with these conditions should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.",

        "Description of the Situation": "From 23 August to 30 September 2017, a total of 73 suspected, probable, and confirmed cases of pneumonic plague, including 17 deaths have been reported in Madagascar. The diagnosis was confirmed by the Institut Pasteur de Madagascar by polymerase chain reaction test or using rapid diagnostic test.The outbreak started following the death of a 31-year-old male from Ankazobe District in the Central Highlands (Hauts-Plateaux), a plague-endemic area. Since then, the Ministry of Public Health of Madagascar enhanced field investigations, contact tracing, surveillance, and monitoring all close contacts.As of 30 September, 10 cities have reported pneumonic plague cases and the three most affected districts include: the capital city and suburbs of Antananarivo (27 cases, 7 deaths), Toamasina (18 cases, 5 deaths), and Faratshio (13 cases, 1 death). On 27 September, during the Coupe des clubs champions de l'oc\u00e9an Indien (a basketball championship held between 23 September and 1 October), a Seychellois basketball player, died in a hospital in Madagascar by pneumonic plague. The Ministry of Public Health of Madagascar immediately started an investigation and there is ongoing contact tracing of all the individuals he came into contact with. Chemoprophylaxis as a precautionary measure has been given to all close contacts.In addition to the 73 cases of pneumonic plague, from 1 August to 30 September, 58 cases of bubonic plague including seven deaths have been reported. One additional case of septicaemic plague has also been reported, and one case where the type is not specified.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "The Ministry of Public Health of Madagascar activated crisis units in Antananarivo and Toamasina and all cases have been provided access to treatment at no cost.There are public health response measures which include:Ongoing investigation of new casesIsolation and treatment of all pneumonic casesActive finding and tracing of contacts and provision of chemoprophylaxisStrengthening of the epidemiological surveillance in the affected and surrounding districtsDisinsection of affected areas, including rodent and vector controlRaising public awareness on preventionRaising awareness among health care workers and providing information to improve case detection, infection control measuresProviding information about infection control measures during burial practices",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Plague is an infectious disease caused by the bacteria\u00a0Yersinia pestis, a zoonotic bacteria, usually found in small mammals and their fleas. It is transmitted between animals from their fleas. Humans can be contaminated by the bite of infected fleas, through direct contact with infected materials or by inhalation.There are three forms of plague infection, depending on the route of infection: bubonic, septicaemic and pneumonic (for more information, see the link below).WHO Plague Fact SheetPneumonic plague-or lung-based plague is the most virulent form of plague and can trigger severe epidemics through person-to-person contact via droplets in the air. The incubation period can be as short as 24 hours. Typically, the pneumonic form is caused by spread to the lungs from an advanced bubonic plague. However, a person with secondary pneumonic plague may form aerosolized infective droplets and transmit plague via droplets to other humans. Untreated pneumonic plague is always fatal.Plague is an endemic disease in Madagascar; cases (predominantly bubonic plague) are reported nearly every year, during the epidemic season (between September and April). However, the ongoing pneumonic plague event has been reported in a non-endemic area and in densely populated cities for the first time.A pneumonic plague is a form of plague that is transmissible from person-to-person, with a potential to trigger severe epidemics if inadequately controlled. Detection of this outbreak occurred more than two weeks after the first case died during which cases travelled to different parts of the country, including the capital Antananarivo. Therefore, the overall risk at the national level is high. The overall regional risk is moderate due to frequent flights to neighbouring Indian Ocean islands. The global risk is low.",
        "WHO Advice": "Prevention and control measuresPreventive measures include informing people when zoonotic plague is present in their environment and advising them to take precautions against flea bites and not to handle animal carcasses. The most rapid and effective method for controlling fleas is to apply an appropriate insecticide formulated as a dust or low-volume spray. People, especially health workers, should also avoid direct contact with infected tissues such as buboes, or close exposure to patients with pneumonic plague.Important prevention and control measures are primarily intended to reduce human transmission and avoid increase in epidemic. These include:Advising the public to take all necessary precautions against flea bites and to not pick up or touch dead animalsImplementing measures to control rodents hosts of\u00a0Yersinia pestis\u00a0(plague bacillus), especially ratsAvoiding direct contact with infected tissues such as buboes, or close exposure to patients with pneumonic plagueEarly presentation to health care - go to the closest health center in the event of suspicious symptomsHealth workers and people who are in direct contact with pneumonic plague patients must wear personal protective equipmentHealth workers should receive a chemoprophylaxis with antibiotics as long as they are exposedSafe management and burial of deceased casesTreatmentRapid diagnosis and treatment is essential to reduce complications and fatality. Effective treatment methods enable plague patients to be cured, if diagnosed in time. These methods include the administration of antibiotics as Aminoglycosides, Fluoroquinolones, Sulfonamides and supportive therapy.Travel adviceBased on the available information to date, the risk of international spread of plague appears very low. WHO advises against any restriction on travel or trade on Madagascar based on the available information.International travellers should be informed about the current plague outbreak and that plague is endemic in Madagascar. Travellers should also be aware that Madagascar is endemic for malaria and should consider the antimalarial prophylaxis recommended by WHO when travelling to Madagascar (see link below).International Travel and Health. List of countries, territories and areas. Vaccination requirements and recommendations for international travellers, including yellow fever and malaria.The risk of infection withYersinia pestis\u00a0for international travellers to Madagascar is generally low. However, travellers in rural areas of plague-endemic regions may be at risk, particularly if camping or hunting or if contact with rodents takes place. In addition, travellers to previously non-endemic regions from where cases of pneumonic plague have been recently reported should avoid crowded areas, avoid contact with dead animals, infected tissues or materials, and avoid close contact with patients with pneumonic plague.* Travellers should avoid contact with dead animals, infected tissues or materials, and avoid close contact with patients with pneumonic plague. Travellers can protect against flea bites using repellent products for personal protection against mosquitoes, which may equally be protective against fleas and other blood-feeding insects. Formulations (lotions or sprays) based on the following active ingredients are recommended by the WHO Pesticides Evaluation Scheme (WHOPES) : DEET, IR3535, Icaridin (KBR3023) or Picaridin. WHO guidance for control of rodent fleas that transmit bubonic plague can be found here:WHO guidance for control of rodent fleas that transmit bubonic plagueIn case of sudden symptoms of fever, chills, painful and inflamed lymph nodes, or shortness of breath with coughing and/or blood-tainted sputum, travellers should immediately contact a medical service. Prophylactic treatment is only recommended for persons who have been in close contact with plague cases, or with other high risk exposures (such as bites from infected fleas or direct contact with body fluids or tissues of infected animals). Travellers should immediately notify health care personnel or authority in case of contact and potential exposure to pneumonic plague patients or other high risk exposures and seek medical advice regarding chemoprophylaxis.** Travellers should avoid self-administration with antibiotics as prophylaxis, unless recommended by medical professionals. Upon return from travel to Madagascar, travellers should be on alert for the above symptoms, and if symptoms appear, they should seek medical care and inform their physician about their travel history to Madagascar.CORRIGENDUM*Please note that an amendment was made to this sentence under the \"Travel Advice\" section on 3 October 2017. **Please note that an amendment was made to this sentence under the \"Travel Advice\" section on 9 October 2017",

        "Epidemiology": "Chikungunya is a viral disease transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes. It causes fever and severe joint pain. Other symptoms include muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue and rash. Joint pain is often debilitating and can vary in duration. Hence the virus can cause acute, subacute or chronic disease. There is no cure for the disease and treatment is focused on relieving the symptoms. The proximity of mosquito breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for chikungunya.",

        "WHO Risk Assessment": "There is a risk for further transmission. This is due to:Aedes albopictus\u00a0being established throughout the Mediterranean basin;this vector having demonstrated the capacity to sustain outbreaks of chikungunya in the past; andthe area of the current case being highly populated and touristic particularly in summer months.The disease mostly occurs in Africa, Asia, Americas and the Indian subcontinent. In 2007, transmission was reported for the first time in Europe, in the Emilia Romagna region of north-eastern Italy. There were 217 laboratory confirmed cases during this outbreak and it demonstrated that mosquito-borne outbreaks by\u00a0Aedes albopictus\u00a0are possible in Europe. Currently, there is another ongoing autochthonous outbreak in Var Department, France that started in early August 2017.",
        "WHO Advice": "Personal protectionBasic precautions should be taken by people within and travelling to this area of Italy. These include wearing long sleeves and pants, use of repellents, and ensuring rooms are fitted with screens to prevent mosquitoes from entering.Clothing which minimizes skin exposure to the day-biting vectors is advised. Repellents can be applied to exposed skin or to clothing in strict accordance with product label instructions. Repellents should contain DEET, IR3535, or Icaridin. People should sleep under a mosquito bed net and use air conditioning or window screens to prevent mosquito bites. Mosquito coils or other insecticide vaporizers may also reduce indoor biting.Vector controlThe\u00a0Aedes albopictus\u00a0species thrives in a wide range of water-filled containers, including tree-holes and rock pools, in addition to artificial containers such as unused vehicle tires, saucers beneath plant pots, rain water barrels and cisterns, and catch basins.Prevention and control relies heavily on reducing the number of these natural and artificial water-filled container habitats that support breeding of the mosquitoes. This requires mobilization of affected communities, and strengthening monitoring of the vector mosquito. During outbreaks, indoor space spraying with insecticides may be performed to kill flying mosquitoes along with killing the immature larvae in water-filled containers through source reduction.",

        "Description of the Situation": "On 23 August 2017, a 31-year-old male from Tamatave, visiting Ankazobe District in central highlands, developed malaria-like symptoms. On 27 August, he developed respiratory symptoms during his journey in a shared public taxi from Ankazobe District to Tamatave (via Antananarivo). His condition worsened and he died. His body was prepared for a funeral at the nearest hospital, Moramanga District Hospital, without safety procedures. Additionally, 31 people who came into contact with this case either through direct contact with the primary case or had other epidemiological links, became ill, and four cases of them died.The outbreak was detected on 11 September, following the death of a 47-year-old woman from Antananarivo, who was admitted to a hospital with respiratory failure caused by pneumonic plague. The public health authorities Direction de la Veille Sanitaire et de la Surveillance Epid\u00e9miologique (DVSSE) immediately launched field investigations. As of 28 September 2017, a total of 51 cases (suspected, probable and confirmed) of pneumonic plague, including 12 deaths were reported in the country. The diagnosis was confirmed by the Institut Pasteur de Madagascar by polymerase chain reaction test and using rapid diagnostic test. In addition to the 51 suspected, probable and confirmed cases of pneumonic plague, and during the same period another 53 cases of bubonic plague including seven deaths have been reported throughout the country. One case of septicaemic plague has also been identified and they were not directly linked to the outbreak.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "The Ministry of Health activated crisis units in Antananarivo and Toamasina and all cases have been provided access to treatment at no cost. Active case finding and contact tracing are on-going and all pneumonic cases are being isolated and treated, and all contacts are receiving chemoprophylaxis.There are additional ongoing key public health response measures which include:Ongoing investigation of new cases.Strengthening of the epidemiological surveillance in the affected and surrounding districts, including contact identification, administration of chemoprophylaxis, and monitoring close contacts of pneumonic plague cases.Disinsection of affected areas, including rodent and vector control.Raising awareness of the population about prevention and actions after exposure.Raising awareness among health care workers and providing information including infection control measures, and implementation of safe burial practices.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Plague is an infectious disease caused by the bacteria\u00a0Yersinia pestis, a zoonotic bacteria, usually found in small mammals and their fleas. It is transmitted between animals from their fleas. Humans can be contaminated by the bite of infected fleas, through direct contact with infected materials or by inhalation.There are three forms of plague infection, depending on the route of infection: bubonic, septicaemic and pneumonic.Bubonic plague (known in mediaeval Europe as the 'Black Death') is the most common form of plague and is caused by the bite of an infected flea. Plague bacillus,\u00a0Yersinia pestis, enters at the bite and travels through the lymphatic system to the nearest lymph node where it replicates itself. The lymph node then becomes inflamed, tense and painful, and is called a \"bubo\". At advanced stages of the infection the inflamed lymph nodes can turn into open sores filled with puss.Pneumonic plague-or lung-based plague- is the most virulent form of plague. Incubation period can be as short as 24 hours. Typically, the pneumonic form is caused by spread to the lungs from advanced bubonic plague. However, a person with secondary pneumonic plague may form aerosolized infective droplets and transmit plague via droplets to other humans. Untreated pneumonic plague is always fatal.Septicaemic plague occurs when infection spreads through the bloodstream, following a bubonic or a pneumonic plague.Plague can be a very severe disease in people, particularly in its septicaemic and pneumonic forms, with a case-fatality ratio of 30\u2013100% if left untreated. The pneumonic form is invariably fatal unless treated early, is especially contagious and can trigger severe epidemics through person-to-person contact via droplets in the air.Plague is an endemic disease in Madagascar; cases of bubonic plague are reported nearly every year, during the epidemic season (between September and April). However, the ongoing pneumonic plague event has been reported in a non-endemic area and in densely populated coastal cities for the first time.Pneumonic plague is a form of plague that is transmissible from person-to-person, with a potential to trigger severe epidemics if inadequately controlled. Detection of this outbreak occurred more than two weeks after the first case died during which cases travelled to different parts of the country, including the capital Antananarivo. Therefore, the overall risk at the national level is high. The overall regional risk is moderate due to frequent flights to neighboring Indian Ocean islands. The global risk is low.",
        "WHO Advice": "Prevention and control measuresPreventive measures include informing people when zoonotic plague is present in their environment and advising them to take precautions against flea bites and not to handle animal carcasses. The most rapid and effective method for controlling fleas is to apply an appropriate insecticide formulated as a dust or low-volume spray. People, especially health workers, should also avoid direct contact with infected tissues such as buboes, or close exposure to patients with pneumonic plague. Important prevention and control measures include:Find and stop the source of infection.Protect health workers: inform and train them on infection prevention and control.Isolate: patients with pneumonic plague. They should be isolated so as not to infect others via air droplets.Surveillance: identify and monitor close contacts of pneumonic plague patients and give them a seven day chemoprophylaxis.Obtain specimens which should be carefully collected and sent to labs for testing.Ensure safe burial practices.TreatmentUntreated plague can be rapidly fatal, so early diagnosis and treatment is essential for survival and reduction of complications. Antibiotics and supportive therapy are effective against plague if patients are diagnosed in time.Travel adviceWHO advises against any restriction on travel or trade on Madagascar based on the available information. It is recommended to provide information at the ports of entry (airports, seaports) of Madagascar about the disease and the necessary protection measures required.For more information, please see the WHO plague fact sheet link below:Plague",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 4 August 2017, the National Health and Family Planning Commission of China (NHFPC) notified WHO of one additional laboratory-confirmed case of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in China.Details of the case patientsThe case was a 58-year-old male from Fujian province. He developed symptoms on 19 July 2017, and was admitted to hospital with severe pneumonia on 29 July 2017. He was reported to have had exposure to a live poultry market. The Chinese government has assessed that it is still likely that sporadic cases will occur in China, taking into consideration the previous epidemic situation and risk assessment. To date, a total of 1558 laboratory-confirmed human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported through IHR notification since early 2013.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "The Chinese government at national and local levels continues to take preventive measures which include:Continuing to guide the provinces to strengthen assessment, prevention and control measures.Continuing to suggest the provinces to make a summary of epidemic prevention and control during the present low-incidence stage to facilitate implementation of long-term measures.Continuing to carry out risk communication and issue information notices to provide the public with guidance on self-protection.The government has cautioned provinces that prevention and control cannot be treated lightly, and that they should stay alert to ensure that cases can be identified and managed in a timely and effective manner.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "As seen in previous years, the number of weekly reported cases has decreased over the summer months. The number of human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) and the geographical distribution in the fifth epidemic wave (i.e. onset since 1 October 2016), however is greater than earlier waves. This suggests that the virus is spreading, and emphasizes that further intensive surveillance and control measures in both the human and animal health sector remain crucial.Most human cases are exposed to avian influenza A(H7N9) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, including live poultry markets. Since the virus continues to be detected in animals and environments - live poultry vending continues, and further human cases can be expected. Additional sporadic human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) in provinces in China that have not yet reported human cases are also expected. Similarly, sporadic human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) detected in countries bordering China would not be unexpected. Although small clusters of cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported, including those involving patients in the same ward, current epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans. Therefore, the likelihood of further community level spread is considered low.Close analysis of the epidemiological situation and further characterization of the most recent viruses are critical to assess the associated risk and to adjust the risk management measures in a timely manner.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should, if possible avoid poultry farms, contact with animals in live poultry markets, entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water, and follow good food safety and food hygiene practices.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions, with regard to this event. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling in, or soon after returning from, an area where avian influenza is a concern.WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and influenza-like illness (ILI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns; ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR 2005; and continue national health preparedness actions.",

        "Description of the Situation": "On 29 July 2017, the national IHR focal point of the United Arab Emirates reported one additional case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV)Details of the caseDetailed information concerning the case reported can be found in a separate document (see link below).MERS-CoV cases reported on 29 July 2017xlsx, 46kb\nThe patient, who lives and works in Al Ain, United Arab Emirates, presented at a hospital in Al Ain on 16 July 2017. On 16 July, a chest X-ray showed pneumonia and he was treated with antibiotics and non-invasive ventilation. On 25 July, his symptoms worsened and a sputum sample was collected and tested for MERS-CoV and influenza. On 26 July, showing no signs of improvement, the patient was transferred to a second hospital in Al Ain and placed in an intensive care unit.A second sputum sample was collected on 26 July and both samples tested positive for MERS-CoV on 27 July 2017. The patient is currently in ICU on mechanical ventilation. Investigations into the source of infection are ongoing. At the time of writing the results of the investigation were not yet provided to WHO.Globally, 2067 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV including at least 720 related deaths have been reported to WHO.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "The Ministry of Health in Abu Dhabi carried out contact tracing and followed up 89 health care workers and 95 contacts at his place of employment. All identified contacts were monitored for 14 days from the last date of exposure. No additional cases were detected.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "MERS-CoV causes severe human infections resulting in high mortality and has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings.The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to animals or animal products (for example, following contact with dromedaries) or human source (for example, in a health care setting). WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.",
        "WHO Advice": "Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns. Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of the disease are nonspecific.Therefore, healthcare workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection\u037e contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection\u037e airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from the infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.",

        "Location": "France",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "Local transmission of chikungunya has been confirmed in south eastern France, with four cases diagnosed in the Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur region as of 23 August 2017. In addition, there is one probable case, and eight suspected cases.The date of onset of symptoms of the first confirmed case was 2 August 2017. All four confirmed and one probable case had symptom onset during the period, 2 to 17 August 2017.All 13 patients (four confirmed, one probable and eight suspected) are aged between 3 to 77 years old, and they all are inhabitants of the same district of the commune of Cannet des Maures in Var department, as announced by the Regional Health Authority (ARS).These are not the first reported cases of chikungunya in France. Two autochthonous cases were recorded in the same area in 2010 and 11 cases in Montpellier in 2014. Nevertheless, chikungunya is an emerging disease in southern Europe, and an outbreak is considered unexpected. The vector Aedes albopictus is establishing itself in large part of the Mediterranean basin and beyond.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "Public health response by French national authoritiesAccording to the national response plan, the following actions are being taken:Vector control measures around the house and working locations of the patients.Blood testing of any suspected case.Risk communication as coordinated by the regional health agency.The entomological investigation on 10 August 2017 confirmed the presence of\u00a0Aedes albopictus\u00a0in the affected area. In addition, blood collection has been postponed in the affected area.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "There is a potential risk for international spread.This is based on:Aedes albopictus\u00a0being established throughout the Mediterranean basin.This vector having demonstrated capacity to sustain outbreaks of chikungunya in the past.The currently affected area being highly touristic particularly in summer months and close to the border with Italy (with established populations of\u00a0Aedes albopictus).Chikungunya transmission was reported for the first time in Europe in 2007, in an outbreak in north eastern Italy. There were 205 cases recorded during that outbreak and it confirmed that mosquito-borne outbreaks by\u00a0Aedes albopictus\u00a0are plausible in Europe.Asymptomatic infection with chikungunya can go undetected and therefore also increases the risk for spread. Additionally, excess rainfall in the affected areas in the coming months, could trigger further increase in transmission as observed in 2014.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO advicePrevention of mosquito bitesBasic precautions should be taken by people within and travelling to this area of France to prevent mosquito bites during the day. These include the use of repellents, wearing long sleeves and pants, and ensuring rooms are fitted with screens to prevent mosquitoes from entering.Repellents can be applied to exposed skin or to clothing in strict accordance with product label instructions. Repellents should contain DEET, IR3535, or Icaridin. People should sleep under a mosquito bed net and use air conditioning or window screens to prevent mosquito bites. Mosquito coils or other insecticide vaporizers may also reduce indoor biting.Vector controlAedes albopictus\u00a0thrives in a wide range of water-filled containers, including tree-holes and rock pools, in addition to artificial containers such as unused vehicle tires, saucers beneath plant pots, rain water barrels and cisterns, and catch basins.Prevention and control relies heavily on reducing the number of these water-filled container habitats that support breeding of the mosquitoes. During outbreaks, indoor space spraying with insecticides may be used to kill flying mosquitoes along with measures to kill the larvae.WHO also encourages strengthening monitoring of the mosquitoes and implementation of additional control as and when needed through arboviral disease networks within Europe. Awareness should also be raised about re-emerging vector-borne diseases among physicians and through social mobilization efforts in affected communities.Blood safetyNational blood services and/or authorities should monitor epidemiological information and strengthen vigilance to identify any potential transmission of chikungunya virus via transfusion. Appropriate safety precautions in line with measures taken to prevent other mosquito-borne disease transmission via transfusion should be taken based on the epidemiological situation and risk assessment.",

        "Description of the Situation": "On 11, 14, and 21 July 2017, the National Health and Family Planning Commission of China (NHFPC) notified WHO of three individual laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in China.Details of the case patientsOn 11 July 2017, the NHFPC reported one laboratory-confirmed human case of infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in China. The case-patient was a 35-year-old male, who developed symptoms on 23 June 2017, and died on 30 June. This was the first reported case from Xinjiang since April 2015. He was a butcher and seller at a live poultry market.On 14 July 2017, the NHFPC reported one laboratory-confirmed human case of infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in China. The case-patient was a 54-year-old male from Yunnan province. He developed symptoms on 23 June 2017 and was admitted to hospital with severe pneumonia on 28 June. He was reported to have had exposure to a live poultry market. On 21 July 2017, the NHFPC reported one laboratory-confirmed human case of infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in China. The case-patient was a 62-year-old female from Jiangsu province. She developed symptoms on 12 July 2017 and was admitted to hospital with severe pneumonia on 13 July. She was reported to have had exposure to a live poultry market. The Chinese government has assessed that it is still likely that sporadic cases will occur in China taking into consideration the previous epidemic situation and risk assessment.To date, a total of 1557 laboratory-confirmed human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported in China through IHR notification since early 2013.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "The Chinese government at national and local level continues to take preventive measures which include:Continuing to guide the provinces to strengthen assessment, and prevention and control measures.Continuing to strengthen control measures focusing on hygienic management of live poultry markets and cross-regional transportation.Conducting detailed source investigations to inform effective prevention and control measures.Continuing to detect and treat human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) early to reduce mortality.Continuing to carry out risk communication and issue information notices to provide the public with guidance on self-protection.Strengthening virology surveillance to better understand levels of virus contamination in the environment as well as mutations, in order to provide further guidance for prevention and control.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "As seen in previous years, the number of weekly reported cases of infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus has decreased over the summer months. However, the number of human infections and the geographical distribution in the fifth epidemic wave (i.e. onset since 1 October 2016) has been greater than earlier waves. This suggests that the virus has spread, and emphasizes that further intensive surveillance and control measures in both the human and animal health sectors remain crucial.Most human case-patients have been exposed to avian influenza A(H7N9) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, including live poultry markets. Since the virus continues to be detected in animals and environments, and live poultry vending continues, further human cases can be expected. Additional sporadic human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) are also expected in provinces in China that have not yet reported human cases. Similarly, sporadic human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) detected in countries bordering China would not be unexpected. Although small clusters of cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported, including those involving patients in the same ward, current epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the capacity for sustained transmission among humans. Therefore the likelihood of further community level spread is considered low.Close analysis of the epidemiological situation and further characterization of the most recent viruses are critical to assess associated risk and to adjust risk management measures in a timely manner.",

        "Description of the Situation": "On 6 May 2017, the Ministry of Health (MoH) of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire notified World Health Organization (WHO) of a dengue fever outbreak in Abidjan, the capital city of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.Suspected cases of dengue were first reported on 22 April 2017 and confirmed by the Institut Pasteur de C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire (IPCI) laboratory on 28 April 2017. As of 11 July 2017, a total of 623 suspected cases including two deaths (case fatality rate: 0.3%) have been reported. A total of 192 cases have been confirmed by PCR, of which 66% were dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2), 29% were DENV-3 and 5% were DENV-1. In addition, 90 samples were confirmed IgM positive by serology.The majority of cases have been reported from Abidjan city. Cocody Bingerville health district accounted for 78% of cases and 80% of all confirmed cases. The general trend of suspected cases of dengue fever is increasing. From 27 June to 4 July 2017, 37 new cases were reported and from 4 to 11 July 2017, 142 new suspected cases were reported. Twenty-seven per cent of the suspected cases are aged between 15 and 29 years old, 55% are 30 years old and above. Fifty four percent of the cases are female. Coinfection with yellow fever was suspected in 68 cases and confirmed in one case. Further laboratory confirmation is ongoing. The main predisposing factors for the outbreak are the high density of mosquito breeding sites, insufficient awareness on mosquito breeding and biting in the community and the ongoing rainy season.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "The MoH through the Institut National d\u2019Hygi\u00e8ne Publique (INHP) is coordinating the response to the outbreak.Vector control interventions including elimination of mosquito breeding sites by source reduction measures (destroying, altering, removing or recycling non-essential containers that provide larval habitats) and fumigation for the elimination of adult mosquitoes are ongoing. Over 17 000 households were inspected and over 250 000 mosquito breeding sites were eliminated and/or treated.Surveillance is being improved with active case finding, sample collection for laboratory confirmation, and dissemination of the case definition. The private health sector is contributing to disease surveillance and management.In addition, community engagement strengthening is another pillar of the ongoing response. Political, religious and community leaders are being sensitized on the prevention and control of dengue virus. The MoH has engaged the town mayors in the outbreak control measures.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "The overall risk observed at the national level is moderate. The weather conditions and coastal location including urban and semi-urban settings, as well as the high entomological indices observed during the initial investigation, are risk factors for dengue fever outbreak in the country. The low case fatality rate shows adequate case management at this time. Strengthening education of health care workers, vector control, laboratory and surveillance interventions are important to contain this outbreak. The risk at regional level is moderate while the risk at global level is low.",
        "WHO Advice": "The current dengue fever outbreak in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire is taking place within the broader context of emergence of the disease in West Africa. The geographical distribution of dengue fever is increasing and cases are being reported in areas where the disease has not previously been reported. Case reporting should be strengthened to ensure continued surveillance of the outbreak in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. Surveillance of vectors in the country is also important. WHO recommends strengthening laboratory diagnosis during this outbreak.WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel and trade to C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire on the basis of the information available on the current dengue fever outbreak.",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "Since the beginning of 2017, Kenya is experiencing an upsurge of cholera cases. The first cholera outbreak reported in 2017 was in Tana River County. The outbreak started on 10 October 2016 and was controlled by April 2017.A second wave of cholera outbreaks started in Garissa County on 2 April 2017 and was reported later in nine other counties including Nairobi, Murang\u2019a, Vihiga, Mombasa, Turkana, Kericho, Nakuru, Kiambu, and Narok. The outbreak is being reported in the general population and in refugee camps. In Garissa County, the outbreak is affecting mainly Dadaab refugee camps and cases and deaths are being reported from Hagadera, Dagahaleh, and IFO2 camps. In Turkana county, the disease is also affecting Kakuma and Kalobeyei refugee camps.In addition to the outbreak reported in the general population, there have been two point source cholera outbreaks in Nairobi County. One occurred among participants attending a conference in a Nairobi hotel on 22 June 2017. A total of 146 patients associated with this outbreak have been treated in different hospitals in Nairobi. A second outbreak occurred at the China Trade Fair held at the KICC Tsavo Ball between 10 and 12 July 2017. A total of 136 cases were reported and one death.Currently, the outbreak is active in two counties, namely Garissa and Nairobi. As of 17 July 2017, a total of 1216 suspected cases including 14 deaths (case fatality rate: 1.2%) have been reported since 1 January 2017. In the week ending 16 July 2017, a total of 38 cases with no deaths were reported.A total of 124 cases tested positive for Vibrio cholerae in the reference laboratory. In the week ending 25 June 2017, 18 samples out of 25 tested positive for Vibrio cholerae Ogawa by culture at the National Public Health Laboratory in Nairobi.The main causative factors of the current outbreak include the high population density that is conducive to the propagation and spread of the disease, mass gatherings (a wedding party held in Karen and in a hotel during an international conference), low access to safe water and proper sanitation and the massive population movements in country and with neighbouring countries.Since December 2014, the Republic of Kenya has been experiencing continuous large outbreaks of cholera, with a cumulative total of 17 597 cases reported (10 568 cases reported in 2015 and 6448 in 2016).",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "The country has activated the national task force to coordinate the response to the outbreak. Since January 2017, WHO and partners are providing technical support to the country for the control of the outbreak. The country will develop a response plan with focus on the preparedness interventions to avert further spread of the outbreak. The WHO country office will repurpose their staff members and experts deployed in Nairobi for the management of the post El Ni\u00f1o effects in the Horn of Africa to support the quick control of this outbreak. WHO will also support the five most at risk counties with disease surveillance and response coordination. Partners on the ground are committed to provide support to the ongoing response efforts including support to primary health care and social mobilization by United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF).",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Cholera is an acute enteric infection caused by the ingestion of bacterium Vibrio cholerae present in faecally contaminated water or food. It is primarily linked to insufficient access to safe water and adequate sanitation. Cholera is always considered a potentially serious infectious disease and can cause high morbidity and mortality. It has the potential to spread rapidly, depending on the exposure frequency, population exposed and the context.Cholera outbreaks have been reported in the Republic of Kenya every year with large cyclical epidemics every five to seven years.The risk of the current outbreak is assessed as high at national and regional levels and moderate at global level. The outbreak occurred in the context of a sub-regional drought, conflicts and insecurity in the Horn of Africa. In addition, the outbreak is affecting the densely populated capital city Nairobi, and two large refugee camps (Kakuma and Dadaab) with massive population movements within country and between neighbouring countries. Previous large outbreaks in the Republic of Kenya have originated from similar settings, and the risk for propagation of cholera within the affected area as well as to other parts of the country is high. The country has identified a limited capacity for response and low access to safe water. There is an opportunity to implement early preparedness and response measures to contain the outbreak and prevent spread.The current outbreaks linked to mass gathering activities poses additional risk of food safety as well as the need to conduct sanitary inspection in restaurants and hotels.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO recommends improving the readiness of counties and health facilities to early detect and respond to the cholera outbreak as well as the reinforcement of coordination and multisectoral approaches. In addition, hygiene practices in households, restaurant, hotels, refugee camps and health facilities should be improved and food safety interventions should be strengthened.WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel and trade to the Republic of Kenya based on the information available on the current outbreak.",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 19 June 2017, the National Health and Family Planning Commission of China (NHFPC) notified WHO of five additional laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in China. On 24 June 2017, the NHFPC notified WHO of 10 additional laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in China. On 30 June 2017, the NHFPC notified WHO of six additional laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in China.Details of the case patientsOn 19 June 2017, the NHFPC reported five laboratory-confirmed human cases of infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in China. Onset dates ranged from 25 April to 6 June 2017. Of these five cases, one was female. The median age was 55 years (range 41 to 68 years). The case patients were reported from Beijing (1), Guangxi (1), Guizhou (1), Hunan (1), and Zhejiang (1). At the time of notification, there was one death. Four cases were diagnosed as having severe pneumonia. Three cases were reported to have had exposure to poultry or live poultry market, and two had no known poultry exposure. No case clustering was reported.\nOn 24 June 2017, the NHFPC reported 10 laboratory-confirmed human cases of infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in China. Onset dates ranged from 5 to 19 June 2017. All cases were male. The median age was 53.5 years (range 31 to 79 years). The cases were reported from Anhui (1), Beijing (2), Guizhou (1), Hebei (1), Inner Mongolia (1), Jiangsu (1), Sichuan (2), and Tianjin (1). This is the first case reported in Inner Mongolia since the virus emerged in 2013 although two cases were recently reported from Shaanxi province but who had likely exposure in Inner Mongolia. At the time of notification, there were two deaths. Eight cases were diagnosed as having either pneumonia (4) or severe pneumonia (4). Nine cases were reported to have had exposure to poultry or live poultry market, and one had no known poultry exposure.One cluster with two cases was reported and both cases are from Panzhihua City, Sichuan Province, and had exposure to the same live poultry market. The cluster includes:\nA 79-year-old male, who had symptom onset on 12 June 2017 and was admitted to hospital with severe pneumonia on 15 June 2017, then died on the 21 June 2017. He was living on an upper floor of the live poultry market and passed regularly through the market.A 48-year-old male, who had symptom onset on 7 June 2017 and was admitted to hospital with severe pneumonia on 11 June 2017. He is a seller of poultry at the same live poultry market.On 30 June 2017, the NHFPC reported six laboratory-confirmed human cases of infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in China. Onset dates ranged from 11 to 23 June 2017. Three cases were male. The median age was 37.5 years (range 4 to 72 years). The cases were reported from Guizhou (1), Shanxi (1), and Yunnan (4) provinces. At the time of notification no associated deaths were reported. Four cases were diagnosed as having either pneumonia (1) or severe pneumonia (3). Two mild cases, identified through ILI surveillance, were reported: one in a child with exposure to market poultry and one in an adult. Five cases were reported to have had exposure to poultry or live poultry market, and one had no known poultry exposure. These are the first cases reported with exposure to the virus in Yunnan province. Previous cases reported from Yunnan province had likely exposure in a neighbouring province.One cluster with two cases was reported, which include:A 33-year-old female from Wenshan, Yunnan Province had symptom onset on 17 June 2017 and was admitted to hospital with severe pneumonia on the same day. She had no apparent exposure to live poultry. Her sister-in-law, a 42-year-old female also from Wenshan, Yunnan Province, visited her in the hospital, developed mild symptoms on 21 June and was hospitalized on 24 June 2017. Investigation of the case revealed that she ran a shop near a live poultry market and bought live poultry from the market on a daily basis before her symptom onset. The investigation concluded that the likely source of her infection was exposure to the virus from visiting live poultry markets.To date, a total of 1554 laboratory-confirmed human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported through IHR notification since early 2013.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "The Chinese government at national and local level is taking preventive measures which include:Continuing to guide the provinces to strengthen assessment, and prevention and control measures.Continuing to strengthen control measures focusing on hygienic management of live poultry markets and cross-regional transportation.Conducting detailed source investigations to inform effective prevention and control measures.Continuing to detect and treat human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) early to reduce mortality.Continuing to carry out risk communication and issue information notices to provide the public with guidance on self-protection.Strengthening virology surveillance to better understand levels of virus contamination in the environment as well as mutations, in order to provide further guidance for prevention and control.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "The number of human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus and the geographical distribution in the fifth epidemic wave (i.e. onset since 1 October 2016) is greater than earlier waves. This suggests that the virus is spreading, and emphasizes that further intensive surveillance and control measures in both human and animal health sector are crucial.According to the epidemiological curve, the number of reported cases on a weekly basis seems to have peaked in early February and is slowly decreasing. The peak in cases this year corresponds to the timing of the peak in cases in previous years.Most human cases are exposed to avian influenza A(H7N9) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, including live poultry markets. Since the virus continues to be detected in animals and environments, and live poultry vending continues, further human cases can be expected. Additional sporadic human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) in other provinces in China that have not yet reported human cases are also expected. Similarly, sporadic human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) detected in countries bordering China would not be unexpected. Although small clusters of cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported including those involving patients in the same ward, current epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans. Therefore the likelihood of further community level spread is considered low.Close analysis of the epidemiological situation and further characterization of the most recent viruses are critical to assess associated risk and to adjust risk management measures in a timely manner.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid, if possible, poultry farms, contact with animals in live poultry markets, entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water, and follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling in or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and influenza-like illness (ILI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR 2005, and continue national health preparedness actions.",

        "Outbreak name": "Dengue",
        "Date Reported": "19 July 2017",
        "Location": "Sri Lanka",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "From 1 January to 7 July 2017, the Epidemiology Unit of the Ministry of Health (MoH) Sri Lanka reported 80 732 dengue fever cases, including 215 deaths. This is a 4.3 fold higher than the average number of cases for the same period between 2010 and 2016, and the monthly number of cases exceeds the mean plus three standard deviations for each of the past six months. Based on sentinel site surveillance for the past seven years the expected peak months of May to July coincides with the south-western monsoon which commences in late April.Approximately 43% of the dengue fever cases were reported from the Western Province and the most affected area with the highest number of reported cases is Colombo District (18 186) followed by Gampaha (12 121), Kurunegala (4889), Kalutara (4589), Batticaloa (3946), Ratnapura (3898), and Kandy (3853). Preliminary laboratory results have identified Dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) as the circulating strain in this outbreak. Although all four DENV have been co-circulating in Sri Lanka for more than 30 years and DENV-2 has been infrequently detected since 2009.The current dengue fever outbreak occurs in a context of massive heavy rains and flooding and is currently affecting 15 out of 25 districts in Sri Lanka where almost 600 000 people have been affected. Heavy monsoon rains, public failure to clear rain-soaked garbage, standing water pools and other potential breeding grounds for mosquito larvae attribute to the higher number of cases reported in urban and suburban areas.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "World Health Organization (WHO) is supporting the MoH Sri Lanka to ensure an efficient and comprehensive health response and the following response measures include:Support from the military forces has been requested by the MoH to increase the number of beds as the health care facilities are overwhelmed. Three temporary wards in a hospital 38km north of Colombo have now been completed.The MoH launched an emergency response including vector control activities that is also supported by the mobilization of defense forces. The army, police and civil defense forces have been mobilized to conduct house-to-house visits in the high-risk areas with health staff. In addition, they are involved in mobilizing the community for garbage disposal, cleaning of vector breeding sites, and in health education.The Regional Office for South-East Asia (SEARO) has constituted a Task Force to guide the response.WHO/ SEARO deployed an epidemiologist, an entomologist and two dengue management experts from the WHO Collaborating Center for case management of Dengue/Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (Queen Sirikit National Institute of Child Health, Thailand) and Ministry of Public health (MoPH) Thailand. The triage protocol was updated in June 2017 to assist with better management of the patients in the health facilities.The WHO Sri Lanka country office has purchased 50 fogging machines to support vector control activities.MOH and WHO have worked together to prepare a strategic and operational plan for intensive measures to control dengue outbreak in next few weeks.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne viral infection caused by four dengue virus serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4). Infection with one serotype provides long-term immunity to the homologous serotype but not to the other serotypes; secondary infections put people at greater risk for severe dengue fever and dengue shock syndrome.Aedes aegypti\u00a0and\u00a0Aedes albopictus\u00a0are the vectors widely adapted to urban and suburban environments. Dengue fever is endemic in Sri Lanka, and occurs every year, usually soon after rainfall is optimal for mosquito breeding. However DENV-2 has been identified only in low numbers since 2009 and is reportedly over 50% of current specimens which have been serotyped.The current dengue epidemic is likely to have repercussions on public health in Sri Lanka.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO promotes the strategic approach known as Integrated Vector Management (IVM) to control mosquito vectors, including those of dengue.The proximity of mosquito vector breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for dengue virus infection.Prevention and control relies on reducing the breeding of mosquitoes through source reduction (removal and modification of breeding sites) and reducing human\u2013vector contact through adult control measures. Both control measures need to implemented simultaneously for effective control.This can be achieved by reducing the number of artificial water containers that hold water (cement tanks for water storage, drums, used tyres, empty bottles, coconut shells, etc.) in and around the home and by using barriers such as insect screens, closed doors and windows, long clothing and use of insect repellents, household insecticide aerosol products, mosquito coils etc. and space spraying with insecticide can be deployed as an emergency measure. As protection from the\u00a0Aedes\u00a0mosquitoes (the primary vector for transmission), it is recommended to sleep (particularly young children, the sick or elderly) under mosquito bed nets, treated with or without insecticide.WHO does not recommend that any general travel or trade restrictions be applied on Sri Lanka based on the information available for this event.",

        "Location": "Nigeria",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 7 June 2017, World Health Organization (WHO) was notified of a cholera outbreak in Kwara State, Nigeria, where the event currently remains localized. The first cases of acute watery diarrhoea were reported during the last week of April 2017 and a sharp increase in the number of cases and deaths has been observed since 1 May 2017. However, the number of new cases reported has shown a decline over the last four reporting weeks.As of 30 June 2017, a total of 1558 suspected cases of cholera have been reported including 11 deaths (case fatality rate: 0.7%). Thirteen of these cases were confirmed by culture in laboratory. 50% of the suspected cases reported are male and 49% are female (information for gender is missing for 1% of the suspected cases). The disease is affecting all age groups.Between 1 May and 30 June 2017, suspected cholera cases in Kwara State were reported from five local government areas; Asa (18), Ilorin East (450), Ilorin South (215), Ilorin West (780), and Moro (50) (information for local government areas is missing for 45 of the suspected cases). Poor sanitation conditions observed in the affected communities is one of the predisposing factors for this cholera outbreak. An important risk factor is the lack of access to clean drinking water and poor hygiene conditions.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "The State Ministry of Health has established an Emergency Operations Center to coordinate the outbreak response with support from the Nigeria Centers for Disease Control, Nigeria Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program, National Primary Health Care Development Agency, the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital, WHO, and partners. The following response measures are being carried out:National multidisciplinary teams were deployed to Kwara State to provide technical support.Cases are being managed in local health care facilities in Kwara State. Active case searching is ongoing in the affected and surrounding communities. These have been strengthened with the formation of surveillance teams made up of the above mentioned partners, and the deployment of local government area Disease Surveillance and Notification Officers (DSNOs).Collation and data entry of cases is currently ongoing.In order to improve laboratory investigations, cholera rapid diagnostic tests are being distributed to selected facilities and health care staff trained on their use.Efforts to improve case management are ongoing. On 15 June 2017, clinicians from the three most affected local government areas were trained on cholera case management, and infection prevention and control (IPC). The current IPC capacity is not well developed and there is poor access to safe water, poor sanitation and hygiene conditions as well as severe challenges to adhere to IPC standards. Efforts are further impeded by limitations of supplies, and a general requirement for patients to pay for treatment.Social mobilization activities continue with the use of Yoruba language radio \u2018jingles\u2019, and religious leaders had been sensitized in the affected state to create awareness and prompt early presentation to healthcare facilities. Communities have been mobilized through house to house sensitization on the use of Aquatab for household water treatment and safe water storage.Environmental investigations are ongoing, and water samples (a local community well and household drinking water) have tested positive for\u00a0Vibrio cholerae.Laboratory response activities include the prepositioning and on-the-job training on use of rapid diagnostic tests in two health facilities. Sensitivity results of\u00a0Vibrio cholerae\u00a0shows resistance to Tetracycline and Ampicillin. Also, additional rapid diagnostic kits are expected to arrive.A multisectoral approach needs to be emphasized and participation encouraged. This would include ensuring proper medical waste management by the State Ministry of Health and access to clean portable water by the Ministry of water resources.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "The current outbreak occurs while the country is facing a serious humanitarian situation and is recovering from a large meningitis outbreak. At this stage, the overall risk is moderate at national level.Potential issues of concern for this outbreak include the ongoing rainy season, the capacity challenges at the State level to manage the outbreak and the sharing of borders with five other States as well as Republic of Benin. Although these issues can potentially lead to the worsening of the outbreak and its spread to other States and neighbouring countries, the country has capacities to quickly control the outbreak.The surveillance system should be strengthened in neighboring States to ease early detection of any potential spread of the outbreak.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO recommends enhanced surveillance for the detection of new cases and improvement of record keeping and data management at healthcare facility level. WHO recommends the urgent establishment of cholera treatment centres in the most affected areas, ensuring that adequate logistics are in place and that medical supplies are in stock. The establishment of a multisectoral approach is imperative to successfully addressing this outbreak.WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel and trade to Nigeria on the basis of the information available on the current event.",

        "Location": "Nigeria",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 18 June 2017, the Nigerian Ministry of Health notified World Health Organization (WHO) of an outbreak of hepatitis E located in the north-east region of the country. The first case was detected on 3 May 2017 in Damasak, a locality at the border with the Republic of the Niger. Samples were collected from the case and sent to laboratory for confirmation. Cases were later reported in Ngala, one of the local government areas in Borno State that borders Cameroon. As of 2 July 2017, 146 confirmed and suspected cases were reported including 21 confirmed cases.In Ngala, 25 infected pregnant women (21%) were reported, including two deaths (case fatality rate = 8%). Cases were reported from three local government areas: Ngala (112), Mobbar (19), and Monguno (14). The number of hepatitis E cases is highest in Ngala with 29 cases reported from 19 June to 2 July 2017. Twenty-seven samples were shipped to the virology laboratory in Lagos for further diagnosis. Among the samples collected and tested, 21 tested positive (10 in Ngala, seven in Mobbar, four in Monguno) and six tested negative. Twenty-three samples have been collected and are pending laboratory tests. This hepatitis E outbreak can propagate rapidly due to the ongoing humanitarian crisis in the region which arises from the volatile security situation in north-eastern Nigeria and continues to persist. This crisis in Nigeria has been ongoing for eight years and as a result 1.9 million people are internally displaced. The region has been facing intense movements of population coming from refugee camps or displaced populations in the areas bordering Chad and Niger. In addition, the fresh wave of returnees from neighbouring countries is overwhelming the current humanitarian capacity. Returnees began entering the town in January 2017 and so far the town has an estimated population of 90 000, according to International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and immigration officials. The town has one unofficial camp hosting returnees considered as strangers or people not affiliated to any of the indigenous communities who have settled in the town. As a result there is overcrowding which is overwhelming the already weak systems in place. Lack of access to essential water, sanitation, hygiene, and health services may lead to propagation of this disease at a very rapid rate.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "Coordinating partners in this response include WHO, United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), Oxfam (representing the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) sector), M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), FHI 360, ICRC (working with Nigerian Red Cross) and North East Regional Initiative (NERI). Response activities for this outbreak include the following:WHO and MSF are supporting case management at no cost to patients and this includes hospitalization of those in need, availability of drugs, and health personnel. Symptomatic case management is supported by MSF at the district level.Epidemiological surveillance system at health facilities exists with the support of local partners.Technical support is being provided from WHO and other partners.As of 15 June 2017, WASH assessed and mapped the current water sources and established contacts for a rapid response in the chlorination of water.A multisectoral approach needs to be emphasized and coordinated between the State Ministry of Health, Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, and Ministries of Water and Environment.Public health awareness through sensitizations and announcements in mosques and other public places by local government area health educators is taking place. In addition, local health personnel are being sensitized, eight Volunteer Community Mobilizers (VCMs), the health care staff, MSF, UNICEF and FHI 360.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Nigeria shares an international border with four countries, Chad and Cameroon in the east, Republic of the Niger to the north, and Republic of Benin on the west. The areas of insecurity are located in north-eastern Nigeria, bordering Republic of the Niger, Cameroon, and Chad. The hepatitis E outbreak is taking place in this same area.This area is characterized by a hepatitis E outbreak in neighbouring Chad and in Republic of the Niger. The ongoing humanitarian crisis and insecurity, high numbers of Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) and refugees, and poor access to safe water leads to the spread of disease. There are also an increasing number of displaced persons moving back to the region post occupation. In addition, the potential cross-border contamination and subsequent increased risk of spread from Republic of the Niger and other neighbouring countries should be considered. There are a number of refugee and IDP camps that are overcrowded and have poor sanitation conditions thereby increasing the risk of hepatitis E. Therefore the observed risk at the national level is high.The risk at regional level is moderate especially in the countries around the humanitarian crisis in north-eastern Nigeria. The risk at global level is low.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO recommends the improvement of the quality and access to safe drinking water, through different methods including the use of at home water purification techniques. The quality of water should be regularly monitored in the affected areas.In addition, WHO recommends the improvement of sanitation by treating and dispensing of human waste correctly as well as improving personal hygiene and the preparation of safe and clean food. The number of latrines in different camps should be increased to address open defaecation.The ongoing interventions should target at risk populations through establishment of antenatal counselling for pregnant women, improving housing conditions for refugees and IDPs and supporting partners in improving health facilities and care.The local and national reference laboratory capacities should be improved for timely confirmation of suspected cases. Cross-border interventions should be strengthened through the Lake Chad sub-regional approach for the management of the current outbreak.WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel and trade to Nigeria on the basis of the information available on the current event.",

        "Description of the Situation": "This is an update to the Disease Outbreak News \u201cUnexplained cluster of deaths \u2013 Liberia\u201d published on  5 May 2017 and update published on 10 May 2017.On 25 April 2017, the Ministry of Health (MoH) of Liberia notified WHO and partners of a cluster of sudden deaths of unknown aetiology in Sinoe County. The event started on 23 April 2017, when an 11-year-old female had been admitted to hospital presenting with diarrhoea, vomiting, and mental confusion after attending the funeral of a religious leader on 22 April 2017. The child died within one hour of admission.Between 23 April and 7 May, a total of 31 cases including 13 deaths, and one case with neurological sequelae of an unknown disease associated with attending a funeral were reported from three counties (Sinoe, Grand Bassa, and Montserrado). The majority of cases did not present with fever, but did present with abdominal pain, diarrhoea, vomiting, and mental confusion. Some patients presented with purpura and/ or petechiae. Most of the cases were related to each other either socially, through family or school. All but two cases attended the funeral, who were subsequently identified as contacts of the index case. On 8 May 2017, MoH informed partners and the public that specimens taken from patients tested positive for Neisseria meningitidis serotype C at the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The outbreak was therefore classified as a meningococcal disease outbreak. A total of 14 cases out of 31 cases were later confirmed with presence of Neisseria meningitidis C by PCR in clinical specimens conducted at the National Reference Laboratory in Liberia or clinically diagnosed due to the presence of purpura fulminans. Laboratory results were further confirmed by the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) and the National Institute of Occupational Health (NIOH) in Johannesburg, South Africa, in addition to serological results of three cases that were tested at Institute Pasteur in France. The temporal characteristics of this outbreak are unusual raising the hypothesis of the presence of a co-factor. Additionally, on 8 May 2017, the MoH informed partners and the public that toxicological investigations conducted by CDC on urine samples from three cases did not suggest that intoxication was the cause of the outbreak. The samples were tested for pesticide metabolites and toxic metals. On 20 June 2017, the MoH was notified that results of toxicological investigations carried out at the Center for Analytical Chemistry in Vienna, Austria, on food samples, water and a soft drink that were consumed during the funeral, were not suggestive of intoxication. The samples were tested for more than 600 fungal and bacterial toxins and these were either not detected or were within regulatory limits.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "The MoH supported by the WHO, CDC, Africa Field Epidemiology Network (AFENET), and other partners started on-site investigations one day after the alert. No disease was identified at the start of the outbreak and Ebola virus disease (EVD) was ruled out within 24 hours of the alert.The National Public Health Institute of Liberia was activated to lead the response. WHO, CDC, UNICEF, and MSF reinforced the field response, and international coordination and information sharing was supported though the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN). The following response activities were implemented:Most of the cases from Sinoe were managed in the local hospital in Greenville, the capital of Sinoe County and received treatment as per EVD protocol.Infection, prevention, and control measures were implemented in the local hospital.Active case searching was conducted and identified attendees of the funeral and close contacts of the cases were followed up for 21 days.Autopsies were conducted on two patients.Approximately 70 specimens (58 clinical specimens and 12 food samples) were collected for laboratory testing and sent to the national reference laboratory in Margibi County, the United States, France, South Africa, and Austria.Chemoprophylaxis was distributed to all attendees, contacts of the cases, health workers, and burial personnel.A meningitis C vaccination strategy was discussed but not implemented due to the lack of secondary transmission.Social mobilization was implemented with the support of UNICEF.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "In the absence of clear understanding of the epidemiology of this outbreak , the risk of recurrence cannot be excluded. However, based on current understanding of the epidemiology of meningococcal disease, the risk is considered low.The efficient and timely implementation of the response to this event is a result of the expertise developed in Liberia following the large outbreak of EVD in 2014. This led to the quick identification of the event, testing and ruling out EVD as the cause of the outbreak, identification of contacts and their follow-up and the collaboration of the country with partners to perform laboratory testing of human and environmental specimens, which led to the identification of the cause of the disease.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel and trade to Liberia on the basis of the information available on the current event.WHO recommends the inclusion of meningococcal septicemia in routine surveillance in Liberia as an epidemic prone disease together with meningitis due to\u00a0Neisseria meningitidis.",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "Lassa fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic fever illness that is known to be endemic in various West African countries including Nigeria. As of 9 June 2017, a total of 501 suspected cases including 104 deaths have been reported since the onset of the current Lassa fever outbreaks season in December 2016. Of the reported cases, 189 have been further classified, 175 laboratory-confirmed including 59 deaths and 14 probable cases (all dead).During the current Lassa fever outbreak, 17 Nigerian states (Anambra, Bauchi, Borno, Cross-River, Ebonyi, Edo, Enugu, Gombe, Kaduna, Kano, Kogi, Nasarawa, Ogun, Ondo, Plateau, Rivers, and Taraba) have reported at least one confirmed case. As of 9 June 2017, the outbreak is still active in nine states (Anambra, Bauchi, Cross-River, Edo, Taraba, Nasarawa, Ondo, Plateau, and Kano).",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "The ongoing outbreak response is focused at State and federal levels and involves coordination of weekly Lassa fever review meeting in conjunction with World Health Organization, United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB), and the African Field Epidemiology Network.The following response measures are being carried out:Enhanced surveillance is ongoing in all affected states and Lassa fever cases are reported to the federal level and contact tracing is ongoing in affected states with an active outbreak through the state surveillance team.The line listing of cases reported across all the states is ongoing and data are uploaded in the VHF database.Lassa fever treatment centers have been established in the affected states to support case management. These centers are supplied with case management as well as infection prevention and control supplies.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Lassa fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic fever illness. Lassa fever is transmitted to humans via contact with food or household items contaminated with rodent urine or faeces. Person-to-person infections and laboratory transmission can also occur. Lassa fever is endemic in Nigeria and other West African countries and causes outbreaks almost every year in different parts of the region, with yearly peaks observed between December and June.Overall, the current risk assessment for Lassa fever outbreak in Nigeria shows a declining trend of outbreaks. Considering this, ongoing response measures remains focused on preparedness and response in general and further risk of large scale outbreaks is not very high. However, a close follow up, active case searching, contact tracing, laboratory support and disease awareness (in the community and for health care workers) should remain ongoing. Although there is constant population movement between these Nigerian states, a large-scale disease transmission or outbreak spread has not been reported. However, there have been sporadic cases reported in Togo and Benin originating from Nigeria.",
        "WHO Advice": "Prevention of Lassa fever relies on promoting good \u201ccommunity hygiene\u201d to discourage rodents from entering homes. In health-care settings, staff should always apply standard infection prevention and control precautions when caring for patients, regardless of their presumed diagnosis.On rare occasions, travellers from areas where Lassa fever is endemic export the disease to other countries. Although other tropical infections are much more common, the diagnosis of Lassa fever should be considered in febrile patients returning from West Africa, especially if they have had exposures in rural areas or hospitals in countries where Lassa fever is known to be endemic. Health care workers seeing a patient suspected to have Lassa fever should immediately contact local and national experts for advice and to arrange for laboratory testing.",

On 26 May 2017, the NHFPC notified WHO of nine additional laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in China.Details of the case patientsOn 19 May 2017, the NHFPC reported a total of 17 human cases of infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus. Onset dates of the cases ranged from 29 April to 13 May 2017. Of these 17 case patients, six were female. The median age was 56 years (range 30 to 84 years). The case patients were reported from Anhui (1), Beijing (1), Chongqing (1), Hebei (6), Hunan (1), Jiangsu (1), Shaanxi (1), Shanxi (1), Shandong (2), Sichuan (1), Zhejiang (1). This is the first case reported in Shanxi. At the time of notification, there were two deaths, 15 case patients were diagnosed as having either pneumonia (6) or severe pneumonia (9).

Eight cases were reported to have had exposure to poultry or live poultry market, and one had no known poultry exposure. No case clustering was reported.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "The Chinese governments at national and local levels are taking further measures which include:Continuing to guide the provinces to strengthen assessment, and prevention and control measures.Continuing to strengthen control measures focusing on hygienic management of live poultry markets and cross-regional transportation.Conducting detailed source investigations to inform effective prevention and control measures.Continuing to detect and treat human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) early to reduce mortality.Continuing to carry out risk communication and issue information notices to provide the public with guidance on self-protection.Strengthening virology surveillance to better understand levels of virus contamination in the environment as well as mutations, in order to provide further guidance for prevention and control.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "The number of human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) and the geographical distribution in the fifth epidemic wave (i.e. onset since 1 October 2016) is greater than earlier waves. This suggests that the virus is spreading, and emphasizes that further intensive surveillance and control measures in both human and animal health sector are crucial.Most human cases are exposed to avian influenza A(H7N9) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, including live poultry markets. Since the virus continues to be detected in animals and environments, and live poultry vending continues, further human cases can be expected. Although small clusters of cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported including those involving patients in the same ward, current epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans. Therefore the likelihood of further community level spread is considered low.Close analysis of the epidemiological situation and further characterization of the most recent viruses are critical to assess associated risk and to adjust risk management measures in a timely manner.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid, if possible, poultry farms, contact with animals in live poultry markets, entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water, and follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling in or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and influenza-like illness (ILI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR 2005, and continue national health preparedness actions.",

        "Outbreak name": "Hepatitis A",
        "Date Reported": "7 June 2017",
        "Location": "European Region and the Americas",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "Between June 2016 and mid-May 2017, an unusual increase in cases of hepatitis A affecting mainly men who have sex with men (MSM) has been reported by low endemicity countries in the European Region, and in the Americas (Chile and the United States of America).In the European Region, 15 countries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom) reported 1173 cases related to the three distinct multi-country hepatitis A outbreaks as of 16 May 2017. In Chile, 706 hepatitis A cases were reported at national level as of 5 May 2017. In the United States, the New York City Health Department has noted an increase in hepatitis A cases among MSM who did not report international travel. In low endemicity settings, WHO recommends hepatitis A vaccination for high-risk groups, such as travellers to endemic areas, MSM, people who inject drugs, and chronic liver disease patients.* For MSM the main risk factor is related to sexual transmission, particularly oral-anal sexual contact. Most of the affected countries have routinely recommended hepatitis A vaccine for MSM. This event is of particular concern from a public health perspective because of the current limited availability of hepatitis A vaccine worldwide. In addition, several national and international lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) pride festivals will take place between June and September 2017, including the World Pride Festival in Madrid, Spain between 23 June and 2 July 2017. In this regard, WHO requests countries to report to WHO Regional IHR Contact points any unusual increase in the number of hepatitis A cases among MSM.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Infection with hepatitis A virus is typically acute and self-limiting. Hepatitis A infection does not cause chronic liver disease and is rarely fatal. Some patients may develop more severe symptoms which may last up to a few months. The virus is primarily spread when an uninfected (and unvaccinated) person ingests food or water that is contaminated with the feces of an infected person. The virus can also be transmitted through close physical contact with an infectious person, through dirty hands and through sexual contact.In low endemicity countries, reported rates of hepatitis A are low. Disease may occur among adolescents and adults in high-risk groups, such as injecting-drug users, MSM, people travelling to areas of high endemicity, and in isolated populations, such as closed religious communities.So far, no fatalities have been reported in connection with the ongoing outbreaks. It has the potential to spread further to the general population if control measures (vaccination, hygiene, food safety, and safer sex measures) are not implemented.",
        "WHO Advice": "Countries with low endemicity profile for hepatitis A should routinely offer vaccination to individuals at increased risk of hepatitis A and of a serious complications following infection. The recommended risk groups, among others, include men who have sex with men. Vaccination against hepatitis A should be included as part of a comprehensive package of services to prevent and control of viral hepatitis, including health education and measures for outbreak control.Use of hepatitis A vaccine should be preferred for pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis (e.g. for close contacts of acute cases of hepatitis A).Countries may consider single-dose schedule for hepatitis A vaccination to control outbreaks of hepatitis A, especially when vaccine availability is scarce.Public health messaging should be directed at groups at increased risk of hepatitis A and of serious complications from the infection.Information should include advice on prevention - vaccination, hygiene, food safety and safer sex measures.Madrid LGBT World Pride festivalThe Madrid LGBT World Pride festival will be held between 23 June and 2 July 2017 in Spain. Up to two million international guests are expected to attend the event. Although the risk for transmission of hepatitis A by food- and water-related routes in Spain is assessed to be low to moderate, the risk of person-to-person sexual transmission of hepatitis A is moderate to high.In Spain, hepatitis A cases reported in 2017 are almost eight times higher than the average number of cases reported during the same period between the years 2012 and 2016. Most cases are men with ages between 15 to 45 years old, and MSM are the most affected group.Specific recommendations for people attending the LGBT World Pride festival are below.Before the event: Those attending the event should seek advice from healthcare providers on hepatitis A vaccination, HIV, and other STI prevention measures prior to departure.During the event: Preventive measures should be reinforced to reduce the risk of sexual and / or food and water borne infections.After the event: Attendants should contact a healthcare provider if experiencing symptoms suggestive of hepatitis A or STI infection.*In intermediate endemicity setting, hepatitis A vaccination can be considered for the whole population, while in high endemicity, infections are common, but the disease is uncommon, hence, the vaccine is not recommended.",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "Between 21 April and 29 May 2017, the National IHR Focal Point of Saudi Arabia reported 25 additional cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection including six fatal cases. On 16 May 2017, the IHR NFP of the United Arab Emirates reported two (2) additional case of MERS-CoV. On 23 May 2017, the National IHR Focal Point of Qatar reported one additional case of MERS-CoV.Details of the casesDetailed information concerning the cases reported can be found in a separate document (see link below).MERS-CoV cases reported between 21 April and 29 May 2017xlsx, 31kb\nSaudi ArabiaBetween 21 April and 29 May 2017, 25 cases of MERS-CoV infection were reported in Saudi Arabia including six fatal cases. Twelve of the 25 reported cases during this time period were associated with three simultaneous, yet unrelated clusters of MERS cases. The Ministry of Health is evaluating each case and their contacts and implementing measures to limit further human-to-human transmission. A description of the three clusters is below.Cluster 1A cluster of cases has been identified at a hospital in Bisha city, Assir Region. Cases associated with this cluster are:First identified fatal case: A 71-year-old male reported on 9 May.Secondary case - Healthcare contact: A 54-year-old male reported to WHO on 13 May.Secondary case - Healthcare contact: A 57-year-old male reported to WHO on 17 May.Cluster 2A cluster of cases has been identified in a hospital in Riyadh city, Riyadh Region. Cases associated with this cluster are:First identified fatal case: A 55-year-old male reported to WHO on 14 May.Secondary case - Healthcare contact: A 33-year-old male reported to WHO on 15 May.Secondary case - Healthcare contact: A 30-year-old female reported to WHO on 15 May.Secondary case - Healthcare contact: A 25-year-old female reported to WHO on 16 May.Secondary case - Healthcare contact: A 38-year-old male reported to WHO on 17 May.Cluster 3A third cluster was detected at a hospital in Wadi Aldwaser city, Riyadh Region. This outbreak is believed to be over based on the follow-up period of all contacts. The four newly identified cases associated with this outbreak are listed below. In total, five cases were associated with this outbreak:\nFirst identified case: A 55-year-old male previously reported to WHO on 19 April (see Disease Outbreak News published on 27 April 2017).\nSecondary case - Household contact: A 50-year-old male reported to WHO on 21 April.Secondary case - Household contact: A 58-year-old male reported to WHO on 21 April.Secondary case - Healthcare contact: A 31-year-old male reported to WHO on 21 April.Secondary case - Household contact: A 26-year-old male reported to WHO on 26 April.United Arab EmiratesOn 16 May 2017, two cases of MERS-CoV infection were reported in the United Arab Emirates. Both cases were reported from Al Ain city and both have reported direct links to dromedary camels. The first case that was identified, a 69-year-old male farmer, is in critical condition in hospital and the second case, a 45-year-old male butcher, is asymptomatic and identified during contact tracing of the first case. Contact tracing and dromedary investigations are ongoing.QatarOn 23 May 2017, one case of MERS-CoV infection was reported in Qatar. The case, a 29 year old male from Doha has reported frequent contact with dromedary camels. The Department of Health Protection and Communicable Disease Control in the Ministry of Public Health and animal health resources are currently carrying out case investigation and contact tracing.Globally, since September 2012, WHO has been notified of 1980 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV including at least 699 related deaths have been reported.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "MERS-CoV causes severe human infections resulting in high mortality and has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings.The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to animals or animal products (for example, following contact with dromedaries) or human source (for example, in a health care setting). WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.",
        "WHO Advice": "Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS-CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly dromedary camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.",

        "Location": "India",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 15 May 2017, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare-Government of India (MoHFW) reported three laboratory-confirmed cases of Zika virus disease in Bapunagar area, Ahmedabad District, Gujarat, State, India.The routine laboratory surveillance detected a laboratory-confirmed case of Zika virus disease through RT-PCR test at B.J. Medical College, Ahmedabad, Gujarat. The etiology of this case has been further confirmed through a positive RT-PCR test and sequencing at the national reference laboratory, National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune on 4 January 2017 (case 2, below). Two additional cases (case 1 and case 3), have then been identified through the Acute Febrile Illness (AFI) and the Antenatal clinic (ANC) surveillance. The cases are reported below in chronological order:Case 1**: A 34-year-old female, delivered a clinically well baby at BJMC in Ahmedabad on 9 November 2016. During her hospital stay, she developed a low grade fever after delivery. No history of fever during pregnancy and no history of travel for the past three months was reported. A sample from the patient was referred to the Viral Research & Diagnostic Laboratory (VRDL) at the BJMC for dengue testing and thereafter found to be positive for Zika virus. She was discharged after one week (on 16 November 2016). The sample was re-confirmed as Zika virus positive by RT-PCR and sequencing at NIV, Pune.Case 2**: During the Antenatal clinic (ANC) surveillance between 6 and 12 January 2017, a total of 111 blood samples were collected at BJMC. One sample from a 22-year-old pregnant female in her 37th week of pregnancy has been tested positive for Zika virus disease.Case 3**: During the Acute Febrile Illness (AFI) surveillance between 10 to 16 February 2017*, a total of 93 blood samples were collected at BJ Medical College (BJMC), Ahmedabad, Gujarat State. One sample from a 64-year-old male presenting with febrile illness of 8 days\u2019 duration (negative for dengue infection) was found to be positive for Zika virus at BJMC, Ahmedabad. This is the first Zika positive case reported through AFI surveillance at BJMC, Ahmedabad, Gujarat State.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "National Guidelines and Action Plan on Zika virus disease have been shared with the States to prevent an outbreak of Zika virus disease and containment of spread in case of any outbreak.An Inter-Ministerial Task Force has been set up under the Chairmanship of Secretary (Health and Family Welfare) together with Secretary (Bio-Technology), and Secretary (Department of Health Research). The Joint Monitoring Group, a technical group tasked to monitor emerging and re-emerging diseases is regularly reviewing the global situation on Zika virus disease.All the international airports and ports have displayed information for travellers on Zika virus disease.The airport health officers along with airport organizations, National Centre for Disease Control, and the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme are monitoring appropriate vector control measures in airport premises.The Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) is tracking for clustering of acute febrile illness in the community.In addition to National Institute of Virology, Pune, and NCDC in Delhi, 25 laboratories have also been strengthened by Indian Council of Medical Research for laboratory diagnosis. In addition, 3 entomological laboratories are conducting Zika virus testing on mosquito samples.The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has tested 34 233 human samples and 12 647 mosquito samples for the presence of Zika virus. Among those, close to 500 mosquitos samples were collected from Bapunagar area, Ahmedabad District, in Gujarat, and were found negative for Zika.The Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK) is monitoring microcephaly from 55 sentinel sites. As of now, no increase in number of cases or clustering of microcephaly has been reported from these centers.Risk communication materials are being finalized by the Central Health Education Bureau, in consultation with UNICEF.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "This report is important as it describes the first cases of Zika virus infections and provides evidence on the circulation of the virus in India. These findings suggest low level transmission of Zika virus and new cases may occur in the future. Efforts to strengthen surveillance should be maintained in order to better characterize the intensity of the viral circulation and geographical spread, and monitor Zika virus related complications. Zika virus is known to be circulating in South East Asia Region and these findings do not change the global risk assessment. WHO encourages Member states to report similar findings to better understand the global epidemiology of Zika virus.The risk of further spread of Zika virus to areas where the competent vectors, the Aedes mosquitoes, are present is significant given the wide geographical distribution of these mosquitoes in various regions of the world. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessment based on the latest available information.",
        "WHO Advice": "Prevention and control relies on reducing mosquitoes through source reduction (removal and modification of breeding sites) and reducing contact between mosquitoes and people. During outbreaks, health authorities may advise that spraying of insecticides be carried out. Insecticides recommended by the WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme may also be used as larvicides to treat relatively large water containers.Basic precautions for protection from mosquito bites should be taken by people traveling to high risk areas, especially pregnant women. These include use of repellents, wearing light colored, long sleeved shirts and pants and ensuring rooms are fitted with screens to prevent mosquitoes from entering.Due to the risk of Zika infection causing microcephaly and other congenital abnormalities, sexually active men and women should be counselled and offered a range of contraceptive methods to be able to make an informed choice on whether and when to become pregnant. For the women already pregnant, they should receive accurate information on their options to the full extent of the law. In addition because of the risk of sexual transmission, it is critical for men and women to receive counselling on safer sexual practices and be offered condoms. In this respect, WHO has issued guidance on prevention of pregnancy, prevention of sexual transmission of Zika and management of pregnancy.***WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction to India based on the current information available.CORRIGENDUM*A correction to the surveillance time period has been made on 30 May 2017 reflecting the correct year. Acute Febrile Illness surveillance took place between 10 to 16 February 2017, and not 10 to 16 February 2016. **The cases have been chronologically re-ordered accordingly on 30 May 2017. ***A paragraph on the prevention of sexual transmission has been added to the WHO advice section on 30 May 2017.",

Of these 23 case patients, ten were female. The median age was 58 years (range 31 to 83 years). The case patients were reported from Beijing (2), Fujian (1), Gansu (1), Hebei (5), Henan (3), Hubei (1), Jiangsu (2), Shaanxi (3), Sichuan (3), Tianjin (1), and Zhejiang (1).At the time of notification, there were seven deaths, 15 case patients were diagnosed as having either pneumonia (5) or severe pneumonia (10), and one case was mild. Nineteen case patients were reported to have had exposure to poultry or live poultry market, one case patient was reported to have visited a patient with avian influenza A(H7N9) in the hospital, one case patient was reported to have had both exposure to live poultry and a contact with a confirmed case, and two were reported to have had no known poultry exposure.Two clusters were reported:A 63-year-old male from Xi\u2019an, Shaanxi Province. He had symptom onset on 29 April 2017 and was admitted to hospital on 2 May. His symptoms were mild.

        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 9 May 2017, WHO was informed of a cluster of undiagnosed illness and deaths including haemorrhagic symptoms in Likati Health Zone, Bas Uele Province in the north of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), bordering Central African Republic. Since 22 April, nine cases including three deaths have been reported. Six cases are currently hospitalized.On 11 May 2017, the Ministry of Health (MoH) of DRC informed WHO that of the five samples collected from suspected cases, one tested positive by RT-PCR for Ebola virus subtype Zaire at the Institut National de Recherche Biom\u00e9dicale (INRB) in Kinshasa. Additional specimens are currently being tested and results, including sequencing, are awaited to describe the outbreak.On 10 May 2017, a multidisciplinary team led by the MoH and supported by WHO and partners was deployed to the field and are expected to reach the affected area on 12 or 13 May 2017 to conduct an in depth field investigation.The investigation is currently ongoing and information is available for only three of the suspected cases: The first case (and possibly the index case), a 39-year-old male presented onset of symptoms on 22 April 2017 and deceased on arrival at the health facility. He presented with haematuria, epistaxis, bloody diarrhoea, and haematemesis. Two contacts of this case are being investigated: a person who took care of him during transport to the health care facility (he has since developed similar symptoms) and a moto-taxi driver (deceased) who transported the patient to the health care facility.Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for health care workers has been shipped on 12 May 2017 to Kisangani. Additional kits are currently being prepared and will be shipped as soon as available.Background and epidemiological situationOn 20 November 2014, as per WHO recommendations, the MoH of DRC and WHO declared the end of the EVD outbreak that started on 24 August 2014 and resulted in a total of 38 laboratory confirmed cases and 28 probable case including 49 deaths in Boende, Equateur province. This was the seventh outbreak of EVD since its discovery in 1976 in DRC.2014: 66 cases of EVD including 49 deaths diagnosed initially in Equateur province (Watsi Kengo, Lokolia, Boende, and Boende Muke).2012: 36 cases including 13 deaths Orientale province - Isiro (Bundibugyo virus).2008\u20132009: 32 cases including 15 deaths in Kasa\u00ef-Occidental (Zaire virus).2007: 264 cases including 187 deaths in Kasa\u00ef-Occidental (Zaire virus).1995: 315 cases and 250 deaths occurred in Kikwit and surrounding area.1977: 1 case (Zaire virus).1976: 318 cases including 280 deaths in Yambuku (Zaire virus).There are five identified subtypes of Ebola virus. The subtypes have been named after the location where they have been first detected. Three of the five subtypes have been associated with large Ebola haemorrhagic fever (EHF) outbreaks in Africa. Ebola\u2013Zaire, Ebola\u2013Sudan and Ebola\u2013Bundibugyo. EHF is a febrile haemorrhagic illness which causes death in 25\u201390% of all cases.",

        "Public Health Response": "The following public health response measures have been implemented:The national committee against viral haemorrhagic fever has been reactivated and will continue meeting every day to coordinate the response.Strengthening of surveillance and investigation including contact tracing are ongoing.WHO will provide assistance and technical support. The deployment to DRC of an additional WHO multidisciplinary team is currently considered to support the response of national authorities.The Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) has been activated to provide additional support if required.The need and feasibility of potential Ebola ring vaccination is being discussed.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "To date, the outbreak is reported in a remote and hard to reach area and appears to be geographically relatively limited. However, Investigations are ongoing to assess the full extent of the outbreak and therefore high vigilance still needs to be maintained.WHO does not recommend any restriction of travel and trade to DRC based on the currently available information.",

        "Location": "China",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 30 April 2017, the National Health and Family Planning Commission of China (NHFPC) notified WHO of 18 additional laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in mainland China.Details of the casesOnset dates ranged from 6 to 23 April 2017. Of these 18 cases, eight were female. The median age was 58 years old (age range among the cases is 4 to 74 years old). The cases were reported from Beijing (2), Chongqing (1), Fujian (1), Gansu (1), Guangdong (2), Henan (1), Hunan (1), Jiangsu (1), Jilin (1), Shandong (2), and Sichuan (5).At the time of notification, there were three deaths, 14 cases were diagnosed as having either pneumonia (4) or severe pneumonia (10), and one case was diagnosed as mild. Seventeen cases were reported to have had exposure to poultry or live poultry market. One was reported to have had no known poultry exposure.To date, a total of 1439 laboratory-confirmed human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported through IHR notification since early 2013.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "Considering the increase in the number of human cases since December 2016, the Chinese government at national and local levels is taking further measures which include:Strengthening risk assessment and guidance on prevention and control for northern provinces, which are reporting increasing cases. On April 24, the NHFPC convened a videoconference on avian influenza A(H7N9) prevention and control for 11 northern provinces.Continuing to strengthen control measures with focus on hygienic management of live poultry markets and cross-regional transportation.Conducting detailed source investigation to inform targeted prevention and control measures.Continuing to detect and treat cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) early to reduce mortality.Continuing to carry out risk communication and issue information notices to provide the public with guidance on self-protection.Strengthening virology surveillance to better understand virus contamination levels and mutations, in order to provide further guidance for prevention and control.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "The number of human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) in the fifth epidemic wave (i.e. onset since 1 October 2016) is greater than the numbers of human cases reported in earlier waves.Human infections with the avian influenza A(H7N9) virus remain unusual. Close observation of the epidemiological situation and further characterization of the most recent human viruses are critical to assess associated risk and to adjust risk management measures in a timely manner.Most human cases are exposed to avian influenza A(H7N9) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, including live poultry markets. Since the virus continues to be detected in animals and environments, and live poultry vending continues, further human cases can be expected. Although small clusters of cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported including those involving patients in the same ward, current epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans. Therefore the likelihood of further community level spread is considered low.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid, if possible, poultry farms, contact with animals in live poultry markets, entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water, and follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling in or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and influenza-like illness (ILI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR 2005, and continue national health preparedness actions.",

        "Description of the Situation": "On 25 April 2017, the Ministry of Health of Liberia notified WHO and partners of a cluster of sudden deaths of unknown aetiology in Sinoe County. The event started on 23 April 2017 when an 11-year-old child had been admitted to hospital presenting with diarrhoea, vomiting and mental confusion after attending the funeral of a religious leader on 22 April 2017. The child died within one hour of admission.As of 4 May 2017, a total of 28 cases including 12 deaths (case fatality rate: 43 %) were reported. Of those, 26 cases including 10 deaths were reported from Sinoe County, all in persons who had attended the funeral. The other two cases, both fatal, were reported from the capital Monrovia in Montserrado County. The first case in Monrovia had attended the funeral in Sinoe County and presented with fever, headache and vomiting on 27 April 2017. He passed away at a hospital in Monrovia. On 29 April 2017, his partner who did not attend the funeral also became ill and passed away the same day. Investigations are still ongoing.To date, a total of 21 specimens have tested negative for Ebola virus disease (EVD) and Lassa fever. Samples from individuals (e.g. blood, urine, rectal swab, and others) and environment, including food samples are being further analyzed and tested.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "The Sinoe County Health Team is coordinating the response with the support of WHO, UNICEF, CDC, Africa Field Epidemiology Network (AFENET), and other partners. The Rapid Response Team (RRT) and the Incident Management System are activated for the management of the event.Cases from Sinoe are being managed in the local hospital in Greenville, the capital of Sinoe County. The initial investigation was conducted by the RRT and active case search is being implemented in the affected and surrounding communities and among people that attended the funeral. In Montserrado County, a total of 42 individuals who participated in the burial in Greenville on 22 April 2017 are being closely monitored. In addition, close contacts of the two cases that died in Montserrado County are also being closely monitored.The National Epidemic Preparedness and Response Committee led by the National Public Health Institute of Liberia has also been activated to support the response. National multidisciplinary teams are deployed to the affected county to provide technical support.Surveillance is being strengthened through line-listing of cases, contact identification and follow-up, active case search and collection of food and drink samples for toxicology testing. Attendants of the funeral and contacts have been listed and are under follow-up.The laboratory analysis is being strengthened. Water testing from the sources serving the affected areas has been conducted and preliminary results ruled out bacterial contamination. Heavy metal and chemical testing is ongoing. The government has requested WHO, CDC, and MSF to support the process of toxicological testing outside the country. Samples are being sent to different laboratories for additional testing.Community engagement is being strengthened, with the support of UNICEF, through mass public awareness, local leaders\u2019 mobilization, and community member sensitization. Infection prevention and control measures are being implemented, namely re-enforcement of hand hygiene practices, water points testing and safe burials.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "At this stage the overall risk of spread of the event is considerate as low. The event is clustered among the participants of the funeral. In addition, there is a sharp decrease in the number of cases and deaths reported since 25 April 2017. These findings are indicative of a point source of exposure. The possibility of a food/ drink/ water contamination event is being actively investigated and the toxicology laboratory test will help to elaborate this hypothesis. A case-control study to identify possible exposures linked to illness is being conducted.The efficient and timely implementation of the response to this event is a result of the expertise developed in Liberia following the large outbreak of EVD in 2014. This led to the quick identification of the event, testing and ruling out EVD as a causative agent, identification of contacts and their follow-up and the ongoing collaboration of the country with partners to perform laboratory testing of human and environmental specimen to identify the disease aetiology.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO recommends the close follow up of the cases and persons who attended the funeral as well as the reinforcement of hygiene and food safety measures in the affected areas. Additionally, WHO supports the ongoing epidemiological and laboratory investigations to identify the aetiological agent of this cluster of cases to guide additional control measures.WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel and trade to Liberia on the basis of the information available on the current event.",

        "Description of the Situation": "On 12 April 2017, the Niger Ministry of Health notified WHO of a hepatitis E virus (HEV) outbreak in the Diffa region, located in the eastern part of the country. On 19 April 2017, the outbreak was officially declared by the Minister of Health.Since 9 January 2017, an increase in cases of jaundice was noted at the Centre Mere-Enfant de Diffa (Mother and Child Center) among pregnant women. Initially, the cases presented with headache, vomiting, fever, conjunctivitis, pelvic pain, and memory loss.Yellow fever was initially suspected as the cause of this outbreak. However, considering a number of cases among pregnant women reporting to the Mother and Child Center in Diffa and the HEV outbreak in neighbouring Chad, HEV was also considered as a potential cause of signs and symptoms. Samples were collected and sent to Institut Pasteur de Dakar (IPD) for laboratory testing. Of the 29 samples tested so far, all tested negative for yellow fever and 15 tested positive for hepatitis E by PCR. As of 3 May 2017, a total of 282 suspected cases including 27 deaths have been reported. All reported deaths except for one death are among pregnant women (mortality ratio: 9.6%). To date, five of the six districts in the Diffa region have reported cases, and 188 cases are from the Diffa and N\u2019Guigmi districts. The Diffa region is a region affected by the Lake Chad basin crisis and there is frequent movement across the border.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "On 6 April 2017, the Ministry of Health convened an emergency meeting to review and better understand the situation of the suspected outbreak. The following activities have been initiated in response to the outbreak:The contingency plan was activated and weekly coordination meetings are being held to coordinate outbreak response activities.A preliminary outbreak investigation has been carried out in Diffa during which biological samples were obtained. In line with the \u201cOne Health\u201d approach, preparations for an in depth investigation are underway.Case management, at no cost to patients, is being implemented, mainly with the support from WHO and M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res.Surveillance for hepatitis E is being strengthened by the inclusion of hepatitis E to the list of mandatory reported diseases.Community engagement to encourage \u201cearly care seeking\u201d is being strengthened, particularly among pregnant women.Cross border collaborations with neighbouring countries are also being strengthened through regular information sharing.A comprehensive outbreak response plan is being prepared and will be used to mobilize the required resources.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Cases are also reported among displaced or refugee populations, impending cross-border spread to Lake Chad basin countries, especially neighboring areas in Nigeria, Chad and Northern Cameron cannot be ruled out. Additionally, the source and scale of the outbreak in Niger needs to be established.This is the first confirmed hepatitis E outbreak in Niger. It is important to note that this event has occurred in a region where vulnerable populations are in a precarious situation following displacement due to insecurity. Currently, Diffa region is the main area affected.To better understand the magnitude of the outbreak, active case finding is being conducted in different health centres in the region and at community level. The reinforcement of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) interventions will support breaking the transmission of the virus and the prevention of new cases. It will be important to keep the cross border communication ongoing so that experiences on management of hepatitis E outbreaks can be exchanged.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO strongly recommends an in depth investigation of the current HEV outbreak in order to ascertain the magnitude of the event and sources of infection. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessments as new information becomes available. WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction to Niger based on the current information available.",

Six of these cases had exposure to infected dromedary camels or consumed their raw milk, which is the most likely source of their infection and two cases were detected through contact tracing of previously reported MERS-CoV cases. Investigation into the history of exposure to the known risk factors in the 14 days prior to onset of symptoms is ongoing for the remaining cases. Contact tracing of household and healthcare contacts is ongoing for all 13 cases.On 18 April 2017, one case of MERS was reported in Qatar.

So far, the observed human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings.The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to animals or animal products (for example, following contact with dromedaries) or human source (for example, in a health care setting). WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.",
        "WHO Advice": "Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS-CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly dromedary camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.",

WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to animals or animal products (for example, following contact with dromedaries) or human source (for example, in a health care setting). WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.",
        "WHO Advice": "Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS-CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly dromedaries, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.",

        "Description of the Situation": "On 14 April 2017, the National Health and Family Planning Commission of China (NHFPC) notified WHO of 15 additional laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in mainland China.Details of the casesOnset dates ranged from 27 March to 11 April 2017. Of these 15 cases, three were female. The median age is 58 years old (age range among the cases is 39 to 81 years old). The cases were reported from Anhui (1), Beijing (1), Gansu (1), Henan (2), Hunan (1), Shandong (2), Sichuan (3), Tianjin (1), Tibet (2), and Zhejiang (1).This is the first time a human case with avian influenza A(H7N9) has been reported from Gansu Province and the first time a human case with avian influenza A(H7N9) has been reported in the fifth epidemic wave in Tianjin (previously two cases were reported to WHO in July 2016).At the time of notification, of the 11 cases with information on the condition of the case, there were two deaths, eight cases were diagnosed as having either pneumonia (1) or severe pneumonia (7), and one case was mild. Twelve cases were reported to have had exposure to poultry or live poultry market and one case had exposure to live poultry sold by street vendors or the environment near the street vendor which might have been contaminated by avian influenza A(H7N9) virus. At the time of notification, there was no information available regarding poultry exposure for two cases.One cluster was reported and includes:A 39-year-old male from Lhasa, Tibet Autonomous Region. He had symptom onset on 28 March 2017 and was admitted to hospital on 1 April 2017. He had severe pneumonia and was still in hospital until 18 April 2017. He worked at a live poultry market and was involved in the slaughter and selling of live poultry.A 41-year-old male from Lhasa, Tibet Autonomous Region who was notified to WHO on 8 April 2017. He had symptom onset on 27 March 2017 and was admitted to hospital on 1 April 2017. At the time of the report he had severe pneumonia and he was still in hospital until 18 April 2017. He worked at the same live poultry stall as the 39-year-old male. He was also involved in the slaughter and selling of live poultry.To date, a total of 1393 laboratory-confirmed human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported through IHR notification since early 2013.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "Considering the increase in the number of human cases since December 2016, the Chinese government at national and local levels is taking further measures which include:Continuing to strengthen control measures with a focus on hygienic management of live poultry markets and cross-regional transportation.Requesting all provinces to stay vigilant and fully implement control and preventive measures.Providing guidance to epidemic areas on strengthening control and prevention.Conducting public risk communication and information publicity to provide the public with guidance on self-protection.Strengthening trace-back investigations and etiology surveillance to define the scope of virus contamination and mutations, in order to provide further guidance for prevention and control.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "The number of human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) in the fifth epidemic wave (i.e. onset since 1 October 2016) is greater than the numbers of human cases reported in earlier waves.Human infections with the avian influenza A(H7N9) virus remain unusual. Close observation of the epidemiological situation and further characterization of the most recent human viruses are critical to assess associated risk and to adjust risk management measures in a timely manner.Most human cases are exposed to avian influenza A(H7N9) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, including live poultry markets. Since the virus continues to be detected in animals and environments, and live poultry vending continues, further human cases can be expected. Although small clusters of cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported including those involving patients in the same ward, current epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans. Therefore the likelihood of further community level spread is considered low.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid, if possible, poultry farms, contact with animals in live poultry markets, entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water, and follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling in or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and influenza-like illness (ILI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR 2005, and continue national health preparedness actions.",

        "Description of the Situation": "Updates on yellow fever vaccination recommendations for international travellers related to the current situation in BrazilThis is an update to the WHO advice posted in the Disease Outbreak News of 27 January 2017, 6 March 2017, and 20 March 2017; and on the WHO International Travel and Health website on 31 January 2017, 14 February 2017, 6 March 2017, and 17 March 2017.As of 3 April 2017, yellow fever virus transmission continues to expand towards the Atlantic coast of Brazil in areas not deemed to be at risk for yellow fever transmission prior to the revised risk assessment, supported by the scientific and technical advisory group on geographical yellow fever risk mapping (GRYF).As of 3 April 2017, epizootics and human cases are under investigation for yellow fever virus infection in Bahia State along the northern coastal area, including the urban area of Salvador, with an epizootic confirmed to be due to yellow fever virus infection in the municipality of Feira de Santana; epizootics associated with yellow fever virus infection were confirmed in the proximity of the urban area of Campinas in S\u00e3o Paulo State, with additional epizootics being under investigation in the same area; and, in Rio de Janeiro State, epizootics are under investigation for yellow fever virus infection in the proximity of the urban areas of Rio de Janeiro City and Niter\u00f3i. These reports are consistent with the increased yellow fever activity observed in the southern areas of Bahia State, bordering Esp\u00edrito Santo and Minas Gerais States, and in areas of Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo States, all sharing the same ecosystem - tropical and sub-tropical moist broad leaves forest. As of 3 April 2017, there is no evidence of human cases of yellow fever virus infection transmitted by Aedes aegypti, the vector that could sustain urban transmission of yellow fever. Therefore, the WHO Secretariat has determined that the following areas in the States of Bahia, Rio de Janeiro, and S\u00e3o Paulo should also be considered at risk for yellow fever transmission:Bahia State: Municipalities of Agua Fria, Acajutiba, Aiquara, Alagoinhas, Amelia Rodrigues, Amargosa, Anguera, Antonio Cardoso, Apora, Apuarema, Aracas, Aracatu, Aramari, Aratuipe, Aurelino Leal, Barra da Estiva, Barra do Rocha, Barrocas, Biritinga, Boa Nova, Boa Vista do Tupim, Bom Jesus da Serra, Breoes, Cabaceiras do Paraguacu, Cachoeira, Caetanos, Cairu, Camacari, Camamu, Candeal, Candeias, Caraibas, Cardeal da Silva, Castro Alves, Catu, Conceicada Feira, Conceicado Almeida, Conceicado Jacuipe, Conde, Contendas do Sincora, Coracade Maria, Cravolandia, Cruz das Almas, Dario Meira, Dias d'Avila, Dom Macedo Costa, Elisio Medrado, Entre Rios, Esplanada, Feira de Santana, Gandu, Gongogi, Governador Mangabeira, Guajeru, Iacu, Ibirapitanga, Ibirataia, Igrapiuna, Iguai, Inhambupe, Ipecaeta, Ipiau, Ipira, Irajuba, Iramaia, Irara, Itaberaba, Itagi ,Itagiba, Itamari, Itanagra, Itaparica, Itaquara, Itatim, Itirucu, Itubera, Jacaraci, Jaguaquara, Jaguaripe, Jandaira, Jequie, Jiquirica, Jitauna, Lafaiete Coutinho, Laje, Lajedo do Tabocal, Lamarao, Lauro de Freitas, Licinio de Almeida, Madre de Deus, Maetinga, Manoel Vitorino, Marau, Maracas, Maragogipe, Marcionilio Souza, Mata de Sao Joao, Milagres, Mirante, Mortugaba, Muniz Ferreira, Muritiba, Mutuipe, Nazare, Nilo Pecanha, Nova Ibia, Nova Itarana, Ouricangas, Pedrao, Pindai, Pirai do Norte, Planaltino, Pojuca, Presidente Janio Quadros, Presidente Tancredo Neves, Rafael Jambeiro, Riachao do Jacuipe, Rio Real, Sao Felix, Sao Felipe, Sao Francisco do Conde, Sao Goncalo dos Campos, Sao Miguel das Matas, Sao Sebastiao do Passe, Salinas da Margarida, Salvador, Santa Barbara, Santa Ines, Santa Teresinha, Santanopolis, Santo Amaro, Santo Antonio de Jesus, Santo Estevao, Sapeacu, Saubara, Sebastiao Laranjeiras, Serra Preta, Serrinha, Simoes Filho, Tanhacu, Tanquinho, Taperoa, Teodoro Sampaio, Teofilandia, Teolandia, Terra Nova, Ubaira, Ubaitaba, Ubata, Urandi, Valenca, Varzedo, Vera Cruz, Wenceslau Guimaraes;Rio de Janeiro State: Urban areas of Rio de Janeiro City and Niter\u00f3i. The addition of these urban areas makes the entire State of Rio de Janeiro at risk for yellow fever transmission;S\u00e3o Paulo State: Urban area of Campinas.Consequently, vaccination against yellow fever is recommended for international travellers visiting those areas in the States of Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo. The typology of activities that international travellers anticipate to undertake while visiting areas determined to be at risk for yellow fever transmission should be weighted in the risk-benefit analysis informing the individual decision to be immunized against yellow fever. There are no other additional changes with respect to other areas of Brazil determined to be at risk for yellow fever transmission in 2013, as published by WHO in the Disease Outbreak News on 27 January 2017, 6 March 2017, and 20 March 2017. The determination of new areas considered to be at risk for yellow fever transmission is an ongoing process and updates will be provided regularly.The current advice by the WHO Secretariat for international travellers going to areas of Brazil deemed to be at risk is the following:Vaccination against yellow fever at least 10 days prior to the travel. Note that, as per Annex 7 of the International Health Regulations (2005), a single dose of a yellow fever vaccine approved by WHO is sufficient to confer sustained immunity and life-long protection against yellow fever disease. Travellers with contraindications for yellow fever vaccine (children below 9 months, pregnant or breastfeeding women, people with severe hypersensitivity to egg antigens, and severe immunodeficiency) or over 60 years of age should consult their health professional for advice;Adoption of measures to avoid mosquito bites;Awareness of symptoms and signs of yellow fever;Seeking care in case of symptoms and signs of yellow fever, while travelling and upon return from areas at risk for yellow fever transmission.For 2017, updates on requirements for the International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis, with proof of vaccination against yellow fever, and WHO vaccination recommendations for international travellers, are available on the WHO International Travel and Health website: Annex 1 and country list. More specific information about requirements for the International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis, with proof of vaccination against yellow fever, implemented by Member States in the Region of the Americas is available on the PAHO yellow fever website.",

No clusters were reported.To date, a total of 1347 laboratory-confirmed human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported through IHR notification since early 2013.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "Considering the increase in the number of human cases since December 2016, the Chinese government at national and local levels is taking further measures including:Continuing to strengthen control measures with a focus on hygienic management of live poultry markets and cross-regional transportation.Assessing and analysing the avian influenza A(H7N9) epidemic trend to guide control measures in the provinces.Increasing attention and guidance to provinces reporting more cases in epidemic control and prevention.Conducting public risk communication and information publicity to provide the public with guidance on self-protection.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "The number of human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) in the fifth epidemic wave (i.e. onset since 1 October 2016) is greater than the numbers of human cases reported in earlier waves.Human infections with the avian influenza A(H7N9) virus remain unusual. Close observation of the epidemiological situation and further characterization of the most recent human viruses are critical to assess associated risk and to adjust risk management measures in a timely manner.Most human cases are exposed to avian influenza A(H7N9) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, including live poultry markets. Since the virus continues to be detected in animals and environments, and live poultry vending continues, further human cases can be expected. Although small clusters of cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported including those involving patients in the same ward, current epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans. Therefore the likelihood of further community level spread is considered low.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid, if possible, poultry farms, contact with animals in live poultry markets, entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water, and follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling in or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and influenza-like illness (ILI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR 2005, and continue national health preparedness actions.",

        "Date Reported": "28 March 2017",
        "Location": "Suriname",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 9 March 2017, the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) in the Netherlands reported a case of yellow fever to WHO. The patient is a Dutch adult female traveller who visited Suriname from the middle of February until early March 2017. She was not vaccinated against yellow fever.The case was confirmed for yellow fever in the Netherlands by RT-PCR in two serum samples taken with an interval of three days at the Erasmus University Medical Center (Erasmus MC), Rotterdam. The presence of yellow fever virus was confirmed on 9 March 2017 by PCR and sequencing at Erasmus MC, and by PCR on a different target at the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine, Hamburg, Germany.While in Suriname, the patient spent nights in Paramaribo and visited places around Paramaribo, including the districts of Commewijne (Frederiksdorp and Peperpot) and Brokopondo (Brownsberg), the latter is considered to be the most probable place of infection. She experienced onset of symptoms (headache and high fever) on 28 February 2017 and was admitted to an intensive care unit (University Medical Center) in the Netherlands on 3 March 2017 with liver failure. The patient is currently in critical condition. Suriname is considered an area at risk for yellow fever and requires a yellow fever vaccination certificate at entry for travellers over one year of age arriving from countries with risk of yellow fever, according to the WHO list of countries with risk of yellow fever transmission; WHO also recommends yellow fever vaccination to all travellers aged nine months and older. This is the first reported case of yellow fever in Suriname since 1972.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "This report of a yellow fever case in the Netherlands with travel history to Suriname has triggered further investigations. Following this event, health authorities in Suriname have implemented several measures to investigate and respond to a potential outbreak in their country, including:Enhancing vaccination activity to increase vaccination coverage among residents. Suriname will continue with its national vaccination programme and will focus on the district of Brokopondo. A catch-up vaccination campaign is also being conducted to increase coverage in Brownsweg.Enhancing epidemiologic and entomologic surveillance including strengthening laboratory capacity.Implementing vector control activities in the district Brokopondo.Carrying out a survey of dead monkeys in the suspected areas.Conducting social mobilization to eliminate Aedes aegypti breeding sites (e.g. by covering water containers/ barrels).Issuing a press release to alert the public.Mapping of the suspect area of Brownsweg, as well as the Peperpot Resort.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Yellow fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease that has the potential to spread rapidly and cause serious public health impact in unimmunized populations. Vaccination is the most important means of preventing the infection.Suriname is a country with a risk of yellow fever transmission in endemic areas. Vaccination is recommended before travelling to Suriname for all travellers aged nine months and older. Suriname requires proof of vaccination against yellow fever for all travellers over one year of age.Suriname introduced the yellow fever vaccination into the routine program for all children aged one years old in 2014.The estimate of national immunization coverage is 86% and only includes children aged one years old. The unvaccinated populations living in the endemic areas are at high risk of yellow fever infection.The current report of a travel-associated case provides evidence to consider local transmission of yellow fever in the country. More investigations are also needed for animal health sectors.In addition, Suriname shares borders with Brazil, which has been experiencing yellow fever outbreaks since January 2017 (the largest outbreak of yellow fever in the Americas in the past three decades).Sequencing and comparison to cases from various other countries is still ongoing, but it is likely that the case is not related to the yellow fever outbreak in Brazil.As South America is currently experiencing a cyclical increase in the number of cases in non-human primates and human cases, an increase in the number of cases in unvaccinated travellers returning from affected areas in South America is not unexpected. The risk of spread of the disease by non-immunized travellers from Suriname to the countries that have the vector for the transmission of the yellow fever virus is considered to be low but cannot be ruled out.Currently, five countries in South America report yellow fever virus activity: Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Colombia and Ecuador. This multi-country yellow fever virus activity might reflect current, wide-spread ecological conditions that favour elevated yellow fever virus transmissibility among wildlife and spill-over to humans. The sequencing analysis of currently circulating strains in Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador and Suriname should provide insight whether the human cases in these countries are epidemiologically linked or represent multiple, independent spill-over events without extensive ongoing community transmission.",
        "WHO Advice": "Advice to travellers planning to visit areas at risk for yellow fever transmission in South America includes:Vaccination against yellow fever at least 10 days prior to the travel. A single dose of yellow fever vaccine is sufficient to confer sustained immunity and life-long protection against yellow fever disease and a booster dose of the vaccine is not needed;Travellers with contraindications for yellow fever vaccine (children below nine months, pregnant or breastfeeding women, people with severe hypersensitivity to egg antigens, and severe immunodeficiency) or over 60 years of age should consult their health professional for advice based on risk benefit analysis;Observation of measures to avoid mosquito bites;Awareness of symptoms and signs of yellow fever;Promotion of health care seeking behaviour while travelling and upon return from an area at risk for yellow fever transmission, especially to a country where the establishment of a local cycle of transmission is possible (i.e. where the competent vector is present).Seeking care in case of symptoms and signs of yellow fever, while travelling and upon return from areas at risk for yellow fever transmission.This case report illustrates the importance of yellow fever vaccination for travellers to countries with risk of yellow fever virus transmission, even for countries that have not reported cases for decades.WHO, therefore, urges Members States to comply with the requirement for yellow fever vaccination for travellers to certain countries and the recommendation for all travellers to countries or areas with risk of yellow fever transmission (see \u2018Yellow fever vaccination requirements and recommendations; malaria situation; and other vaccination requirements \u2013 List of countries, territories and areas\u2019 in related links). Viraemic returning travellers may pose a risk for the establishment of local cycles of yellow fever transmission predominantly in areas where the competent vector is present. If there are medical grounds for not getting vaccinated, this must be certified by the appropriate authorities.WHO does not recommend that any general travel or trade restriction be applied on Suriname based on the information available for this event.",

        "Description of the Situation": "Updates on yellow fever vaccination recommendations for international travellers related to the current situation in BrazilAs of 16 March 2017, yellow fever virus transmission continues to expand towards the Atlantic coast of Brazil in areas not deemed to be at risk for yellow fever transmission prior to the revised risk assessment, supported by the scientific and technical advisory group on geographical yellow fever risk mapping (GRYF), and published by WHO in the Disease Outbreak News of 27 January 2017 and 6 March 2017; as well as on the WHO International Travel and Health website on 31 January 2017,14 February 2017, and 6 March 2017.As of 16 March 2017, confirmed cases of yellow fever virus infection in humans were reported in Rio de Janeiro State, and epizootics and human cases are under investigation for yellow fever virus infection in S\u00e3o Paulo State. These reports are consistent with the increased yellow fever activity observed in other States (Esp\u00edrito Santo and Minas Gerais) that share the same ecosystem \u2014 tropical and sub-tropical broad leaved forests. As of 16 March 2017, there is no evidence of human cases of yellow fever virus infection transmitted by Aedes aegypti, the vector that could sustain urban transmission of yellow fever. The WHO Secretariat has determined that the State of Rio de Janeiro, with the exception of the urban areas of Rio de Janeiro City and Niter\u00f3i, and the State of S\u00e3o Paulo, with the exception of the urban areas of S\u00e3o Paulo City and Campinas, should also be considered at risk for yellow fever transmission. Consequently, vaccination against yellow fever is recommended for international travellers visiting those areas in the States of Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo. The typology of activities that international travellers anticipate to undertake while visiting areas determined to be at risk for yellow fever transmission should be weighted in the risk-benefit analysis informing the individual decision to be immunized against yellow fever. There are no other additional changes with respect to other areas of Brazil determined to be at risk for yellow fever transmission in 2013, as published by WHO in the Disease Outbreak News on 31 January 2017 and 6 March 2017. The determination of new areas considered to be at risk for yellow fever transmission is an ongoing process and updates will be provided regularly.The current advice by the WHO Secretariat for international travellers going to areas of Brazil deemed to be at risk is the following:Vaccination against yellow fever at least 10 days prior to the travel. Note that, as per Annex 7 of the International Health Regulations (2005), a single dose of a yellow fever vaccine approved by WHO is sufficient to confer sustained immunity and life-long protection against yellow fever disease. Travellers with contraindications for yellow fever vaccine (children below nine months, pregnant or breastfeeding women, people with severe hypersensitivity to egg antigens, and severe immunodeficiency) or over 60 years of age should consult their health professional for advice;Adoption of measures to avoid mosquito bites;Awareness of symptoms and signs of yellow fever;Seeking care in case of symptoms and signs of yellow fever, while travelling and upon return from areas at risk for yellow fever transmission.For 2017, updates on requirements for the International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis, with proof of vaccination against yellow fever, and WHO vaccination recommendations for international travellers, are available on the WHO International Travel and Health website: Annex 1 and country list. More specific information about requirements for the International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis, with proof of vaccination against yellow fever, implemented by Member States in the Region of the Americas is available on the PAHO yellow fever website.",

He had symptoms onset on 24 February 2017 and was admitted to a hospital on 25 February 2017. He passed away on 1 March. He had exposure to live poultry.A 10-year-old male from Anhui Province. He had symptoms onset on 27 February 2017, and was admitted to hospital on 1 March 2017 for pneumonia. He also had a history of exposure to live poultry.On 7 March 2017, the Department of Health, China, Hong Kong SAR confirmed a case of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in a 76-year-old man with underlying illnesses. The patient travelled to Fuzhou, Fujian between 11 February and 1 March 2017 and he visited a wet market there.He developed symptoms on 3 March 2017. His nasopharyngeal aspirate specimen tested positive for avian influenza A(H7N9) on 7 March 2017. His clinical diagnosis is pneumonia and he is now in a critical condition. The patient\u2019s close contact has remained asymptomatic so far and has been put under medical surveillance. Tracing of his other contacts in China, Hong Kong SAR is underway.To date, a total of 1281 laboratory-confirmed human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported through IHR notification since early 2013.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "Considering the increase in the number of human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) since December 2016, the Chinese government has enhanced measures such as:The NHFPC strengthened epidemic surveillance, conducted timely risk assessment and analysed the information for any changes in epidemiology.The NHPFC requested local NHFPCs to implement effective control measures on the source of outbreaks and to minimize the number of affected people.Strengthened early diagnosis and early treatment, treatment of severe cases to reduce occurrence of severe cases and deaths.Further enhanced medical treatment.Joint investigation teams between NHFPC and Ministries of Agriculture, Industry and Commerce visited Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui and Guangdong provinces where more cases occurred for joint supervision, inspection and guidance on local surveillance, medical treatment, prevention and control and to promote control measures with a focus on live poultry market management and cross-regional transportation.Relevant prefectures in Jiangsu province have closed live poultry markets in late December 2016 and Zhejiang, Guangdong and Anhui provinces have strengthened live poultry market regulations.Conducted public risk communication and shared information with the public.The Centre for Health Protection of the Department of Health in China, Hong Kong SAR has taken the following measures:Urged the public to maintain strict personal, food and environmental hygiene both locally and during travel.Issued an alert to doctors, hospitals, schools and institutions of the latest situation.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "The number of human cases with onset from 1 October 2016 is greater than the total numbers of human cases in earlier waves.Human infections with the avian influenza A(H7N9) virus remain unusual. Close observation of the epidemiological situation and further characterization of the most recent human viruses are critical to assess associated risk and to adjust risk management measures timely.Most human cases are exposed to avian influenza A(H7N9) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, including live poultry markets. Since the virus continues to be detected in animals and environments, and live poultry vending continues, further human cases can be expected. Although small clusters of human cases with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported including those involving patients in the same ward, current epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans. Therefore the likelihood of further community level spread is considered low.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid, if possible, poultry farms, contact with animals in live poultry markets, entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water, and follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling in or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and influenza-like illness (ILI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR 2005, and continue national health preparedness actions.",

        "Description of the Situation": "Between 6 and 21 February 2017 the national IHR focal point of Saudi Arabia reported 12 additional cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) including three fatal cases. Four deaths among previously reported MERS cases were also reported (case numbers 1, 2, 4 and 6 in the Disease Outbreak News published on 10 February 2017).Detailed information concerning these cases can be found in a separate document (see link below). Most of these cases are primary cases with exposure to infected dromedary camels or consumption or their raw milk, which is the most likely source of their infection.Globally, since September 2012, 1917 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV including at least 684 related deaths have been reported to WHO.MERS-CoV cases reported between 6 February and 21 February 2017xlsx, 19kb",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "MERS-CoV causes severe human infections resulting in high mortality and has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings.The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to animals or animal products (for example, following contact with dromedaries) or human source (for example, in a health care setting). WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.",
        "WHO Advice": "Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS-CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "Benin and Togo, exported from BeninOn 20 February 2017, the Ministry of Health of Benin notified WHO of a Lassa fever case in Tchaourou district, Borgou Department, Benin, close to the border with Nigeria. The case was a pregnant woman who was living in Nigeria (close to the border with Benin).On 11 February 2017, she was admitted to a hospital where she delivered the baby (a premature neonate) by caesarean section and passed away on 12 February 2017. Samples were tested positive for Lassa fever in the laboratory in Cotonou, Benin and later in the Lagos University Teaching Hospital Lassa laboratory in Nigeria. The newborn and father left the hospital without notice on 14 February 2017 and went to Mango in northern Togo where they were admitted to a hospital. The newborn tested positive for Lassa fever and the father tested negative in the Institut National d\u2019Hygi\u00e8ne in Lom\u00e9, Togo. The baby was treated with ribavirin and is currently in stable condition; he is still hospitalised in northern Togo for issues of prematurity and overall monitoring. A total of 68 contacts are being followed-up in Benin and 29 contacts are being followed-up in Togo linked to the pregnant woman and newborn. Togo, exported from Burkina Faso On 26 February 2017, after receiving information from Togo, the Ministry of Health of Burkina Faso has notified WHO of a confirmed Lassa fever case in a hospital in the northern part of Togo. The case has originated from Ouargaye district which is in the central eastern part of Burkina Faso. The case was a pregnant woman who was previously hospitalized in Burkina Faso. She was discharged and had a miscarriage at home. After the second hospitalization in Burkina Faso she was transmitted to a hospital in Mango, northern Togo, and passed away on 3 March 2017.Samples from the pregnant woman tested positive for Lassa fever at the Institut National d\u2019Hygi\u00e8ne in Lom\u00e9, Togo. A total of 7 contacts have been identified in Togo linked to the pregnant woman and contact tracing is ongoing; 135 contacts in Burkina Faso have been identified linked to the pregnant woman and contact tracing is ongoing.TogoOn 2 March 2017, a man was admitted to a health centre in the Kpendial health district for fever and melena and was referred to a regional hospital on 3 March 2017. Samples from the male case were sent to the Institut National d\u2019Hygi\u00e8ne in Lom\u00e9, Togo, and tested positive for Lassa fever. The case left the hospital on 6 March. Investigations are ongoing. The male case and his close relatives are under follow up at their home. A total of 18 contacts were identified in Togo linked to the male case.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "Health authorities in Benin, Burkina Faso and Togo are implementing the following measures to respond to these Lassa fever cases, including:Deployment of rapid response teams to the affected areas for epidemiological investigation.Identification of contacts and follow-up.Strengthening of infection prevention and control measures in health facilities and briefing of health workers.Strengthening of cross border collaboration and information exchanges between Togo, Burkina, Mali and Benin.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Lassa fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic fever illness. The Lassa virus is transmitted to humans via contact with food or household items contaminated with rodent urine or faeces. Person-to-person infections and laboratory transmission can also occur.Lassa fever is endemic in neighbouring Nigeria and other West African countries and causes outbreaks almost every year in different parts of the region, with yearly peaks observed between December and February. The most recent Lassa fever outbreak in Benin occurred in the same area in January \u2013 May 2016. At least 54 cases including 28 deaths have been reported at country level. Both Burkina Faso and Togo have reported sporadic cases in the past.Given constant important population movements between Nigeria, Togo, Burkina Faso, Niger and Benin, the occurrence of sporadic Lassa fever cases in West Africa was expected and further sporadic cases may occur in countries of the region.However, with the ongoing control measures in Benin, Togo and Burkina Faso the risk of further disease spread from these confirmed cases is considered to be low. Considering the seasonal peaks in previous years, increase in the disease awareness, better preparedness and response in general, and strengthening of regional collaboration the risk of large scale outbreaks in the region is medium.",
        "WHO Advice": "Prevention of Lassa fever relies on promoting good \u201ccommunity hygiene\u201d to discourage rodents from entering homes. In health-care settings, staff should always apply standard infection prevention and control precautions when caring for patients, regardless of their presumed diagnosis.On rare occasions, travellers from areas where Lassa fever is endemic export the disease to other countries. Although other tropical infections are much more common, the diagnosis of Lassa fever should be considered in febrile patients returning from West Africa, especially if they have had exposures in rural areas or hospitals in countries where Lassa fever is known to be endemic. Health-care workers seeing a patient suspected to have Lassa fever should immediately contact local and national experts for advice and to arrange for laboratory testing.",

        "Description of the Situation": "Updates on yellow fever vaccination recommendations for international travellers related to the current situation in BrazilAs of 3 March 2017, yellow fever virus transmission continues to expand towards the Atlantic coast of Brazil in areas not deemed to be at risk for yellow fever transmission prior to the revised risk assessment, supported by the scientific and technical advisory group on geographical yellow fever risk mapping (GRYF), and published by WHO in the Disease Outbreak News of 27 January 2017, and on the WHO International Travel and Health website on 31 January 2017 and 14 February 2017.Taking into account the speed of spread observed in Esp\u00edrito Santo State, the proximity to the urban area of Vitoria of epizootics and human cases under investigation for yellow fever infection, as well as the implementation of yellow fever vaccination campaign in the State of Esp\u00edrito Santo as a whole, the WHO Secretariat has determined that the State of Esp\u00edrito Santo in its entirety should be considered at risk for yellow fever transmission. Therefore, vaccination against yellow fever is recommended for international travellers visiting any area in Esp\u00edrito Santo State. There are no additional changes with respect to other areas of Brazil determined to be at risk for yellow fever transmission in 2013 and as published by WHO in the Disease Outbreak News of 27 January 2017. The determination of new areas considered to be at risk for yellow fever transmission is preliminary and updates will be provided regularly.The current advice by the WHO Secretariat for international travellers going to areas of Brazil deemed to be at risk, including Esp\u00edrito Santo State in its entirety, is the following:Vaccination against yellow fever at least 10 days prior to the travel. Note that, as per Annex 7 of the International Health Regulations (2005), a single dose of a yellow fever vaccine approved by WHO is sufficient to confer sustained immunity and life-long protection against yellow fever disease. Travellers with contraindications for yellow fever vaccine (children below 9 months, pregnant or breastfeeding women, people with severe hypersensitivity to egg antigens, and severe immunodeficiency) or over 60 years of age should consult their health professional for advice;Adoption of measures to avoid mosquito bites;Awareness of symptoms and signs of yellow fever;Seeking care in case of symptoms and signs of yellow fever, while travelling and upon return from areas at risk for yellow fever transmission.For 2017, updates on requirements for the International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis, with proof of vaccination against yellow fever, and WHO vaccination recommendations for international travellers, are available on the WHO International Travel and Health website: Annex 1 and country list. More specific information about requirements for the International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis, with proof of vaccination against yellow fever, implemented by Member States in the Region of the Americas is available on the PAHO yellow fever website.",

        "Description of the Situation": "On 18 February 2017, the National Health and Family Planning Commission of China (NHFPC) reported to WHO the results of genetic sequencing on virus isolates from two previously reported cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus from Guangdong province. Changes at the cleavage site of the HA gene suggestive of being highly pathogenic to poultry was confirmed by the Chinese National Influenza Centre of the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC).Details of the casesThe two cases were reported through International Health Regulations (IHR) notification on 19 January 2017. A 43-year-old female with symptom onset on 29 December 2016. The case recovered. She had poultry exposure but also cared for her sister who was hospitalized with avian influenza A(H7N9). This was reported as a family cluster. A 57-year-old male with symptom onset on 5 January 2017. The case is still hospitalized and in critical condition as of 22 February 2017. He was reported to have had poultry exposure. Investigation revealed exposure to sick and dead poultry. None of the 105 close contacts of these two cases developed symptoms during the two weeks of medical observation. To date, there is no evidence of changes in pathogenicity to and transmissibility among humans.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "Considering the new developments in H7N9 genetic sequence, the Chinese government is implementing additional measures in Guangdong province on top of current existing measures:Closure of markets for cleaning.Emergency monitoring of poultry markets and flocks.Culling of flocks if the strain is confirmed in them.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "This is the first report of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus, since its emergence in 2013, having genetic sequences that are suggestive of evolving from a low pathogenic into a highly pathogenic avian virus. Similar changes at the cleavage site of the HA gene were also found in genetic sequence data uploaded in Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) of a virus from a recent human case reported by Taiwan, China earlier to WHO on 4 February 2017 with travel history to Guangdong. In addition the Ministry of Agriculture China reported to World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) on 21 February 2017 that genetic sequences of virus samples from live poultry markets in Guangdong also showed changes consistent with highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses. So far the above genetic changes have been found in viruses from human, poultry and environmental samples from Guangdong or with travel history to Guangdong province.In addition the genetic sequences from the two human cases from Guangdong and the case reported by Taiwan, China showed amino acid substitutions associated with neuraminidase inhibitor antiviral drug resistance. It was reported that the three patients received antiviral treatment before samples were taken.So far there is no evidence of change of epidemiological patterns of avian influenza A(H7N9) infection in humans. There is no evidence that a change in the virus from low pathogenic to high pathogenic avian influenza virus has an impact on the pathogenicity or transmissibility in humans.Overall the likelihood of further community level spread remains low.WHO is closely monitoring the impact of these viruses on public health through its Global Influenza Surveillance and Research System (GISRS) network, and its effect on animal health through collaboration with Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and OIE, and will update public health risk assessment accordingly.A change in the virus from low pathogenicity to highly pathogenicity in poultry may have implications on surveillance and control strategies at the animal sector.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid, if possible, poultry farms, contact with animals in live poultry markets, entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water, and follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions.

        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "Brazilian health authorities at the federal, state, and municipal levels are implementing several measures to respond to the outbreak, including:The Ministry of Health (MoH) are assisting state and municipal health secretaries with human, vector and epizootic surveillance, strengthening of health care services, and risk communication.Vector control activities including environmental sanitation and spatial application of insecticide are being conducted alongside surveys to assess infestation rates for Aedes using the Larval Index Rapid Aedes assay (LIRAa).National reference centers including Evandro Chagas Institute in Belem do Para and FioCruz in Rio de Janeiro are supporting field operations concerning human and NHP case confirmation and entomological investigations.House-to-house and fixed post immunization campaigns are being conducted in municipalities at risk.A cumulative total of 12.5 million doses of the yellow fever vaccine have been distributed by the MoH to Minas Gerais (5.5 million), Esp\u00edrito Santo (2.5 million), S\u00e3o Paulo (2.75 million), Bahia (900 000), and Rio de Janeiro (850 000).To support Brazil health authorities in their response efforts, PAHO has activated a dedicated event management structure, which will work together with WHO headquarters. Furthermore, technical experts from both PAHO headquarters and the PAHO country office in Brazil have been deployed to assist with the coordination of operations, epidemiological investigations, data collection, and information management.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "The growing number of reported cases, the detection of yellow fever circulation in new states, and the occurrence of epizootics in areas that were previously not considered at risk of yellow fever transmission indicate that the geographic extent of the outbreak is increasing. Although Brazilian health authorities have swiftly implemented a series of public health measures to control the outbreak, including mass vaccination campaigns, it may take some time to reach optimal coverage in some of the areas at risk as a large portion of the affected populations are dispersed and live in remote locations. It is, therefore, expected that in the near term additional cases will continued to be detected.To date, in the three states with laboratory-confirmed yellow fever human cases, there has been no evidence of transmission by Aedes aegypti; nevertheless, entomological indices in urban centers of these three states are sufficiently high for sustaining arbovirus transmission, as evidenced by documented outbreaks of dengue, chikungunya and Zika outbreak in late 2016.The reports of suspected epizootics in the rural areas of states bordering Argentina, Paraguay, and Bolivia are a cause of concern as the outbreak may potentially spread to one or more of these countries due to favourable conditions for yellow fever transmission and suboptimal levels of vaccination coverage. The introduction of the virus in these countries could potentially trigger large epidemics of yellow fever.In view of the evolving situation, and considering that travellers for the Carnival in the next few weeks may take side tours outside the main cities, a further spread within Brazil cannot be excluded. Likewise, the risk of international spread cannot be formally ruled out but this risk is currently considered to be very low and limited to unvaccinated travellers returning from affected areas. Viraemic returning travellers may pose a risk for the establishment of local cycles of yellow fever transmission predominantly in areas where the competent vector is present.WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessment based on the latest available information.",
        "WHO Advice": "Advice to travellers planning to visit areas at risk for yellow fever transmission in Brazil includes vaccination against yellow fever at least 10 days prior to the travel; observation of measures to avoid mosquito bites, awareness of symptoms and signs of yellow fever, promotion of health care seeking behavior while traveling and upon return from an area at risk for yellow fever transmission, especially to a country where the competent vector for yellow fever transmission is present).As per Annex 7 of the IHR a single dose of yellow fever vaccine is sufficient to confer sustained immunity and life-long protection against yellow fever disease. Booster doses of yellow fever vaccine are not needed. If, on medical ground, a traveler cannot be vaccinated against yellow fever, this must be certified by the relevant authorities as per Annex 6 and Annex 7 of the IHR.The WHO Secretariat does not recommend restriction of travel and trade with Brazil on the basis of the information currently available on this event.",

Although the successful roll-out of MenA conjugate vaccine has resulted in the decreasing trend of meningitis A, other meningococcal serogroups are shown to have caused epidemics. This report of the Neisseria meningitidis W outbreak in Togo calls for a close monitoring of the changing epidemiology of meningococcal disease. There is a need to ensure that global stocks of vaccines are available, laboratory and epidemiologic surveillance systems are strengthened and outbreak response strategies in the countries are on hand.",
        "WHO Advice": "The epidemic response consists of prompt, appropriate case management involving reactive mass vaccination of populations, and strengthening of meningitis surveillance.",

        "Description of the Situation": "On 4 February 2017, Taipei Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported one laboratory-confirmed case of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus. This is the fifth human case with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus reported from Taipei CDC.Details of the caseThe patient, a 69-year-old male travelled to Yangjiang City, Guangdong Province, China from 18 September 2016 to 25 January 2017. He developed fever and chills on 23 January 2017 while in Guangdong. On 25 January 2017, the patient returned to Taiwan, China and visited the emergency room. During the medical consultation, neither fever nor pneumonia was detected and a rapid test for influenza on an oropharyngeal sample was negative. PCR testing of additional samples was obtained the next day and tested negative for avian influenza A viruses. On 1 February 2017, he visited the emergency room again due to fever, productive cough and dyspnoea. Bilateral pneumonia was diagnosed and he was then intubated due to respiratory failure. On 2 February 2017, additional sputum samples were collected and were positive for avian influenza A(H7N9) virus. Contact tracing following the detection of this case revealed that two of six of his colleagues in mainland China had upper respiratory symptoms which resolved after treatment. Two family members of the case have been asymptomatic at the time of reporting.No source of exposure to the avian influenza A(H7N9) virus has been identified thus far for this patient. He denied any exposure to live birds or live poultry markets during his stay in Guangdong province. The patient also denied exposure to others with suspicious illnesses. He remained at home or in the hospital after returning to Taiwan, China. To date, a total of 1223 laboratory-confirmed human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported through IHR notification since early 2013.This total number of cases includes five (5) cases reported from Taipei CDC, 20 cases reported from Hong Kong CHP, two (2) cases reported from Macau SAR, two (2) cases reported from Canada and one (1) case reported from Malaysia.*",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "Response measures have been taken by Taipei CDC such as:Carrying out epidemiological investigations, close contact tracing, management and medical observations.Strengthening surveillance of pneumonia with unknown causes, routine influenza sentinel surveillance, as well as flu and avian flu virology surveillance.The travel history of the case has been sent to the National Health and Family Planning Commission of China for further investigation.The agriculture department in Taiwan, China has been conducting wild bird and poultry surveillance for avian influenza routinely since 1997. Avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses were detected in wild birds in 2015, but based on phylogenetic analysis, these viruses differed from the avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses currently infecting poultry in mainland China with spillover infections in humans exposed to these infected birds.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "While similar sudden increases in the number of human avian influenza A(H7N9) cases identified have been reported in previous years the number of cases reported during this season is exceeding previous seasons. The number of human cases with onset from 1 October 2016 accounts for nearly one-third of all the human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus infection reported since 2013.However, human infections with the avian influenza A(H7N9) virus remain unusual. Close observation of the epidemiological situation and further characterization of the most recent human viruses are critical to assess associated risk and to adjust risk management measures timely.Most human cases are exposed to avian influenza A(H7N9) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, including live poultry markets. Since the virus continues to be detected in animals and environments, and live poultry vending continues, further human cases can be expected. Additional sporadic human cases may be also expected in previously unaffected provinces as it is likely that this virus circulates in poultry of other areas of China without being detected.Should infected individuals from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during travel or after arrival. If this were to occur, further community level spread is considered unlikely as this virus has not acquired the ability to transmit easily among humans.Although small clusters of human cases with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported including those involving healthcare workers, current epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans. Therefore the likelihood of further community level spread is considered low.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid, if possible, poultry farms, contact with animals in live bird markets, entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water, and follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling in or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and influenza-like illness (ILI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005), and continue national health preparedness actions.CORRIGENDUM*Please note that an amendment was made to this sentence on 2 March 2017, the total number of cases includes two (2) cases from Macau SAR and not one (1) case as originally published on 22 February 2017.",

Onset dates range from 13 December 2016 to 9 February 2017. Of these 304 cases, 86 are female (28%). Cases range in age from 3 to 85 years, with a median age of 58 years. The cases are reported from Jiangsu (67), Zhejiang (53), Guangdong (32), Anhui (31), Jiangxi (27), Hunan (26), Fujian (20), Hubei (20), Sichuan (6), Guizhou (4), Henan (4), Shandong (4), Shanghai (3), Liaoning (2), Yunnan (2), Beijing (1), Hebei (1), and Guangxi (1). At the time of notification, there were 36 deaths, two cases had mild symptoms and 82 cases were diagnosed as either pneumonia (34) or severe pneumonia (48). The clinical presentations of the other 184 cases are not available at this time. 144 cases reported exposure to poultry or live poultry market, 11 cases have no clear exposure to poultry or poultry-related environments. 149 cases are under investigation. Two clusters of two-person were reported:A 22-year-old female (mother of 3-year-old girl case who had symptom onset on 29 January 2017, died on 7 February 2017) reported from Yunnan province. She had developed symptom on 4 February 2017. She took care of her daughter during her daughter was sick. Both are reported to expose to poultry in Jiangxi province. A 45-year-old female (previously reported on 9 January) from Sihui city, Guangdong province. She had symptom onset on 17 December 2016, and died on 24 December 2016. She was exposed to poultry. Another case was a 43-year-old female from Guangzhou city, Guangdong province. She had symptom onset on 30 December 2016 and was admitted to hospital on the same day. She is the sister of the 45-year old female described above. She took care of her hospitalized sister but also had exposure to poultry. At the time of reporting, she was suffering from pneumonia.While common exposure to poultry is likely, human to human transmission cannot be ruled out.To date, a total of 1222 laboratory-confirmed human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported through IHR notification since early 2013.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "Considering the increase in the number of human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) since December 2016, the Chinese government has enhanced measures such as:Strengthened early diagnosis and early treatment, treatment of severe cases to reduce occurrence of severe cases and deaths.Convened meetings to further deploy prevention and control measures.Conducted public risk communication and sharing information with the public.The NHFPC strengthened epidemic surveillance, conducted timely risk assessment and analysed the information for any changes in epidemiology.The NHFPC requested local NHFPCs to implement effective control measures on the source of outbreaks and to minimize the number of affected people.The NHFPC, joined by other departments such as agriculture, industry and commerce, Food and Drug Administration, re-visited Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui and Guangdong provinces where more cases occurred for joint supervision. The affected provinces have also strengthened multisectoral supervision, inspection and guidance on local surveillance, medical treatment, prevention and control and promoted control measures with a focus on live poultry market management control.Relevant prefectures in Jiangsu province have closed live poultry markets in late December 2016 and Zhejiang, Guangdong and Anhui provinces have strengthened live poultry market regulations.",

        "Outbreak name": "Seoul virus",
        "Date Reported": "20 February 2017",
        "Location": "United States of America and Canada",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 24 January 2017, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), through their Health Alert Network (HAN) publication, reported 8 cases of infection with Seoul virus in the states of Wisconsin (n=2) and Illinois (n=6). The first two cases were reported in early December 2016, when two home-based pet rat breeders in Wisconsin State developed an acute febrile illness, later confirmed as Seoul virus infection. Rats (Rattus norvegicus) at some facilities also tested positive for Seoul virus. Human infection with Seoul virus is not commonly found in the United States; this virus family also includes Sin Nombre virus, which is the most common hantavirus causing disease in the United States. This is the first known outbreak associated with pet rats in the United States.To date, a total of 11 people have been infected in the states of Wisconsin, Illinois, and Colorado. Two of the individuals were hospitalized. Seoul virus infection was also confirmed in pet rats from ratteries in Wisconsin, Illinois, and Minnesota. Follow-up investigations indicate that potentially infected rats may have been distributed or received in Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, North Dakota, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, and Wisconsin. All investigations to date have indicated that the affected breeding facilities are limited to the pet rat trade. None of these ratteries supply (or have supplied) rats to research facilities. In addition, follow-up investigations by the United States CDC and public health officials in Canada indicate that rats have been exchanged between the United States and Canada. According to the Canada IHR national focal point report of 10 February 2017, the Canadian rat breeding facilities under investigation exported rats to the United States and also imported rats from affected United States facilities. As of 10 February 2017, three positive human cases for the Hemorrhagic Fever Renal Syndrome (HFRS) group of hantaviruses, which includes Seoul, Hantaan, Puumala and Dobrava viruses, have been identified by serology in Canada. No serious illness was reported in these individuals. Two of the cases breed rats, and the third had contact with rats. Further laboratory testing and virus characterization is ongoing. Further epidemiologic investigation and testing of rats is planned.",
        "Epidemiology": "Seoul virus is a type of hantavirus that is transmitted from rats to humans after exposure to aerosolized urine, droppings, or saliva of infected rodents, or after exposure to dust from their nests or bedding. Transmission may also occur from rat bites or when contaminated materials are directly introduced into broken skin or onto mucous membranes. For Seoul virus, the natural host is the Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus) and the black rat (Rattus rattus). This virus has been found in both pet rats and wild rat populations around the world. The incubation period varies from 1 to 8 weeks; however, most individuals develop symptoms within 1 to 2 weeks after exposure. Seoul virus infection symptoms can range from mild to severe. In the severe form of the disease, patients can exhibit bleeding and renal syndromes. Inapparent infections can also occur. Seoul virus infection is not transmissible from human to human. There is no effective treatment available for Seoul virus infection.",
        "Public Health Response": "Health authorities both in the United States and Canada are implementing the following measures to respond to the outbreak:CanadaFurther laboratory testing and virus characterization to confirm Seoul virus exposure in humans.Assessment of associated pet rat breeding facilities.Further epidemiological investigation and testing of rats.United States of AmericaThe United States CDC and State Health Departments are collaborating to investigate the outbreak.Depopulation carried out in some affected ratteries.Investigations regarding the importation and exportation of the rats before the detection of the outbreak ongoing.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is the severe form of the infection with Seoul virus. The case fatality rate (CFR) among humans who develop HFRS due to Seoul virus ranges from 1-2%. Of the 11 cases reported in the United States so far, two were hospitalized and none have died.Although the three HFRS cases in Canada are still under investigation, there is some evidence of an epidemiological link to the United States Seoul virus outbreak.There is no available information on further distribution of the infected rats outside of the United States and Canada. Rats do not show symptoms of disease when they are infected with Seoul virus. Once infected, rats can continue to shed virus throughout their lives, potentially infecting other rats and humans. The United States CDC is working with state health departments in the United States and others to investigate the outbreak of Seoul virus infections in pet rats and humans, to trace shipments and transport of rats, some of which may be infected with Seoul virus, to better understand how the virus entered the pet trade and to interrupt transmission of Seoul virus to other rats and humans.Because there is presently no effective treatment for Seoul virus infection, preventing infections in people is important.If infected rodents have contact with local rat populations, the infection with Seoul virus could spread to non-infected rodents and consequently change the prevalence of this zoonotic disease, both in rodents and in humans.",
        "WHO Advice": "International pet trade has the potential to spread and cause emerging or re-emerging disease in humans. WHO encourages State Parties to developed and maintain the capacity to detect, and report similar events.",

        "Description of the Situation": "Between 2 and 7 January 2017 the national IHR focal point of Saudi Arabia reported nine (9) additional cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) including two (2) fatal cases. Two (2) deaths among previously reported MERS cases (cases no. 7 and 8 in DON published on 17 January 2017) were also reported.Detailed information concerning these cases can be found in a separate document (see link below). The five cases from Buridah reported are part of a small health care setting outbreak involving 2 hospitals. A Ministry of Health rapid response team has been dispatched and measures to prevent further cases including contact tracing, and strengthening of infection, prevention and control have been put in place. None of the cases reported are health care workers. Globally, since September 2012, 1888 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV including at least 670 related deaths have been reported to WHO.MERS-CoV cases reported between 2 and 7 January 2017xlsx, 14kb",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "MERS-CoV causes severe human infections resulting in high mortality and has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings.The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to animals or animal products (for example, following contact with dromedaries) or human source (for example, in a health care setting). WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.",
        "WHO Advice": "Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS-CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.",

In total, at the end of epidemiological week 2, 2017, a total of 126 HEV RDT have been performed, of them 57 (45.2%) were positive, while 69 (54.8%) tested negative for Hepatitis E. 18 (31.6%) of the 57 patients that tested positive using the HEV RDT also had a positive malaria test, and 20 (29%) out of 69 patients that tested negative using the HEV RDT also had a positive malaria test. Since September 2016, 11 deaths have been reported among the hospitalized cases but the total case fatality might be underestimated. As of 13 January 2017, 16 pregnant women presenting with AJS have been hospitalized and tested for Hepatitis E, 12 (75%) of them tested positive using the HEV RDT. Of the pregnant women presenting with AJS, four have reportedly died (three had tested positive for Hepatitis E). Approximately 90% of the AJS cases were reported from Am Timan which appears to be the epi-centre of the ongoing outbreak, and most of the cases are identified through active case findings. As of 13 January 2017, AJS cases have been reported from 59 different quartiers in and surrounding Am Timan.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "The outbreak was detected when two pregnant icteric women were admitted in the Am Timan Regional Hospital, partly supported by M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) since 2009. MSF has been responding to the outbreak in support to the Ministry of Public Health (MPH) with a total of 14 expatriate staff and over 400 national staff dedicated to the epidemic response in addition to staff involved in the regular project. MSF provides support in implementing outbreak monitoring, active surveillance, water chlorination and community sensitization in Am Timan.*In addition, World Health Organization (WHO) and the MPH are complementing the initial investigations carried out between 22\u201329 October 2016 by extending investigations to the whole region in order to identify potential new foci.** WHO country office is also supporting the MPH in passive and active surveillance strengthening outside of Am Timan, developing case definition, surveillance tools, simple case management protocols and testing algorithm, defining criteria for case hospitalization and carrying out needs assessment in and outside the town of Am Timan. WHO is also advocating for additional needed partnerships especially to address the needs in terms of water and sanitation and social mobilisation in Am Timan as in the region.***",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Based on the available information, there appears to be a plateau in the number of cases reported in the past 5 weeks from the affected area with an average of 70 cases reported weekly where only a minor proportion (7.2%) requires hospitalization. The infectious risk seems confined to Am Timan and immediate surroundings. However, the event remains under close monitoring at all levels of WHO. The current level of risk for further spread remains as moderate to high and at local level, and the limited capacity to respond to date calls for additional immediate support, especially in terms of water and sanitation and social mobilisation.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO recommends the continuation of the investigations with a specific case definition as to describe the time, place and person characteristics of the outbreak and identify the source. It is important to identify the source of contamination of the surface water and, in the meantime, to ensure water safety by chlorination at the point of use by the population. Travellers to Chad should follow standard hygiene recommendations in terms of water and food safety for travellers. These should protect them against Hepatitis E, as the risk of person to person transmission is very low.CORRIGENDUM*Please note that the first paragraph under the heading \"Public health response\" was added on 30 January 2017. **Please note that an amendment was made to this sentence on 30 January 2017 to add additional information regarding the investigations carried out during October 2016. ***Please note that an amendment was made to this sentence on 30 January 2017 to add additional contextual information regarding the needed partnerships.",

Following a positive nasopharyngeal aspirate (taken on 9 January) for avian influenza A(H7), he was re-admitted to hospital for isolation late on 10 January 2017. Another nasopharyngeal aspirate taken on 11 January 2017 was later further confirmed as positive for avian influenza A(H7N9) virus on 11 January 2017. The patient visited a relative\u2019s home in Foshan, Guangdong with backyard chickens between 31 December 2016 and 3 January 2017, but reported no direct contact with these chickens. The family visited a market while in Guangdong but reported no entry to the poultry section.As of 11 January 2017, 27 close contacts and 70 other contacts have been identified as contacts of the 10-year-old boy. Among four symptomatic other contacts, two have tested negative for influenza A, while the other two are pending testing. Remaining contacts have remained asymptomatic and are under medical surveillance. On 12 January 2017, a human case of infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) was reported from the Health Bureau, China, Macao SAR. The case is a 72-year-old female who lives in Zhongshan, Guangdong, a city close to China, Macao SAR. She had exposure to chickens at her home and often goes to a live poultry market near her house. On 8 January 2017, she developed symptoms and was admitted to a hospital in Zhongshan. She left the hospital in Zhongshan on 9 January 2017 and travelled to China, Macao SAR where she was admitted to the government hospital on 10 January 2017 with the diagnosis of pneumonia. Specimens collected on 10 January 2017 tested positive for avian influenza A(H7N9) by RT-PCR on 12 January 2017. The patient was referred to an isolation ward. The patient has a history of hypertension and diabetes. She is currently in stable condition.As of 12 January 2017, three relatives, four ambulance workers, four hospital roommates and 32 medical workers were identified as close contacts to the 72-year-old female. They are receiving antiviral treatment for five days and are under medical observation for the next 10 days.To date, a total of 918 laboratory-confirmed human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported through IHR notification since early 2013.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "The Centre for Health Protection of the Department of Health in China, Hong Kong SAR has taken the following measures:Urged the public to maintain strict personal, food and environmental hygiene both locally and during travel.Issued an alert to doctors, hospitals, schools and institutions of the latest situation.Authorities in China, Macao SAR have taken the following measures:Conducted a risk assessment.Management of the case and observation of close contacts.Communicated with authorities in mainland China to follow-up on the family and medical staff.Held a press conference to share information on the situation and response.Urged the public to avoid contact with live poultry.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Increases in the number of human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) infection have been observed in previous years during this period of time (December-January). Nevertheless close monitoring of the epidemiological situation and further characterization of the most recent viruses are critical to assess associated risk and to make timely adjustments to risk management measures.Most human cases are exposed to avian influenza A(H7N9) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, including live poultry markets. Since the virus continues to be detected in animals and environments, further human cases can be expected. Although small clusters of human cases with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported including those involving healthcare workers, current epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans. Based on available information we have, further community level spread is considered unlikely.Human infections with the avian influenza A(H7N9) virus are unusual and because there is the potential for significant public health impact, it needs to be monitored closely.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid, if possible, poultry farms, contact with animals in live bird markets, entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water, and follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling in or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and influenza-like illness (ILI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005), and continue national health preparedness actions.",

        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "MERS-CoV causes severe human infections resulting in high mortality and has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings.The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to animals or animal products (for example, following contact with dromedaries) or human source (for example, in a health care setting). WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.",
        "WHO Advice": "Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS-CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.",

The case is a 62-year-old man with underlying illnesses, who travelled to Zengcheng, Guangzhou on 15 December 2016. He developed influenza-like symptoms on 1 January 2017 while he was in Guangzhou. He was admitted to a hospital in Dongguan on 2 January 2017 and returned to Hong Kong SAR on 3 January 2017, where he was admitted to hospital on 4 January 2017 for further treatment. His condition deteriorated and he was transferred to an intensive care unit for further management. He passed away on 6 January 2017. His samples tested positive for A(H7N9) by RT-PCR on 5 January 2017. The patient reported no recent exposure to poultry or live poultry markets. Contact tracing is underway.On 9 January 2017, 106 human cases of infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) were reported from the NHFPC. The onset dates ranged from 22 November 2016 to 29 December 2016. Of these 106 cases, 36 are female. The median age is 54 years (age range among the cases is 23 to 91 years old). The cases are reported from Jiangsu (52), Zhejiang (21), Anhui (14), Guangdong (14), Shanghai (2), Fujian (2) and Hunan (1). At the time of notification, there were 35 deaths and 57 severe cases. Eighty of the cases are reported to have had exposure to poultry or a live poultry market. Two clusters were reported.First cluster:A 66-year-old male from Suzhou city, Jiangsu province. He had symptom onset on 25 November 2016, was admitted to hospital on 28 November 2016 and died on 12 December 2016. He was exposed to a live poultry market.A 39-year-old female from Suzhou city, Jiangsu province. She had symptom onset on 8 December 2016 and was admitted to hospital on the same day. She is the daughter of the 66-year old male. At the time of report, she was suffering from severe pneumonia.Human-to-human transmission between the 66-year-old male and the 39-year-old female cannot be ruled out.Second cluster:A 66-year-old male from Hefei city, Anhui province. He had symptom onset on 16 December 2016, and was admitted to hospital on 17 December 2016 and died on 20 December 2016. He was exposed to a live poultry market.A 62-year-old male from Hefei city, Anhui province. He had symptom onset on 22 December 2016. He was admitted in the same ward as the 66-year old male. His current condition is severe. Human-to-human transmission between the 66-year-old male and the 62-year-old male cannot be ruled out.To date, a total of 916 laboratory-confirmed human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported through IHR notification since early 2013.",

        "Description of the Situation": "On 6 January 2017, the Brazil Ministry of Health (MoH) reported 12 suspected cases of yellow fever from six municipalities in the state of Minas Gerais.On the same day, the Brazil IHR National Focal Point (NFP) informed PAHO/WHO that the 12 cases are male, residing in rural areas, and have an average age of approximately 37 years (range: 7\u201353 years). The first of these cases had onset of symptoms on 18 December 2016. Samples from the cases were sent to the State Reference Laboratory (the Ezequiel Dias Foundation) for differential diagnosis, including dengue, hantavirus, leptospirosis, malaria, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and viral hepatitis (A, B, C, D, and E). Results are pending.On 12 January, the Brazil IHR NFP provided an update on the event informing that a total of 110 suspected cases, including 30 deaths, had been reported from 15 municipalities of Minas Gerais: Ladainha (31 cases, 11 deaths), Caratinga (20 cases, 1 death), Imbe de Minas (14 cases, 1 death), Piedade de Caratinga (12 cases, 4 deaths), Pot\u00e9 (6 cases, 3 deaths), Ubaporanga (6 cases, 2 deaths), Itambacuri (5 cases, 3 deaths), Ipanema (4 cases, 1 death), Malacacheta (4 cases, 2 deaths), Entre Folhas (2 cases), Frei Gaspar (1 case), Inhapim (2 cases), S\u00e3o Domingos das Dores (1 case), S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o do Maranh\u00e3o (1 fatal case), and Setubinha (1 fatal case). Serological tests for 19 suspected cases were positive for yellow fever. Among them, 10 deaths (CFR: 53%) were reported. The report also confirms that there had been epizootics in 13 municipalities of Minas Gerais. Six of these 13 municipalities have not so far reported human cases of yellow fever: Agua Boa, Durande, Ipatinga, Sao Pedro do Sacui, Simonesia, and Te\u00f3filo Otoni.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "Health authorities at the federal, state, and municipal levels are implementing several measures to respond to the outbreak:The MoH has deployed technical teams to the state of Minas Gerais to assist the state and municipal secretary of health with surveillance and outbreak investigation, vector control, and coordination of health care services;A house-to-house immunization campaign is being conducted in the rural areas of affected municipalities;Preparedness activities are being conducted in states bordering Minas Gerais, for a potential introduction of yellow fever;The local press is working together with the MoH to keep the public constantly informed on the situation.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Yellow fever outbreak has previously been detected in Minas Gerais. The most recent outbreak occurred in 2002\u20132003, when 63 confirmed cases, including 23 deaths (CFR: 37%), were detected.The current yellow fever outbreak is taking place in an area with relatively low vaccination coverage, which could favor the rapid spread of the disease. The concern is that transmission may extend to areas located in proximity of Minas Gerais, such as the state of Esp\u00edrito Santo and the south of Bahia, which have favorable ecosystems for the transmission of the virus. These areas were previously considered to be at low risk of transmission and, consequently, yellow fever vaccination was not recommended. The introduction of the virus in these areas could potentially trigger large epidemics of yellow fever. There is also a risk that infected humans may travel to affected areas, within or outside of Brazil, where the Aedes mosquitoes are present and initiate local cycles of human-to-human transmission. Response efforts are further complicated by the fact that it is occurring in the context of concomitant outbreaks of Zika virus, chikungunya and dengue.WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessment based on the latest available information.",
        "WHO Advice": "Yellow fever can easily be prevented through immunization provided that vaccination is administered at least 10 days before travel. WHO, therefore, urges Members States especially those where the establishment of a local cycle of transmission is possible (i.e. where the competent vector is present) to strengthen the control of immunisation status of travellers to all potentially endemic areas.WHO does not recommend any restriction of travel and trade to Brazil based on the current information available.",

        "Description of the Situation": "On 6 December 2016, the Ministry of Health (MoH) in Madagascar alerted WHO of a suspected plague outbreak in Befotaka district, Atsimo Atsinanana region in the south-eastern part of the country. The district is outside the area known to be endemic area in Madagascar. No plague cases have been reported in this area since 1950.As of 27 December 2016, 62 cases (6 confirmed, 5 probable, 51 suspected) including 26 deaths (case fatality rate of 42%) have been reported in two adjacent districts in two neighbouring regions of the country. 28 cases, including 10 deaths have been reported from Befotaka District in Atsimo-Atsinanana Region and 34 cases including 16 deaths have been reported from Iakora district in Ihorombe Region.Of the 11 samples tested, 5 were positive for plague on rapid diagnostic test and 6 are now confirmed at Institut Pasteur laboratory. Of the total reported cases, 5 are classified as pneumonic plague cases and the remaining as bubonic plague.Retrospective investigations carried out in those two districts showed that it is possible that the outbreak might have started in mid-August 2016. The investigation in neighbouring villages is still ongoing. On 29 December, an investigation carried out within 25 km of the initial foci in Befotaka district has reported three deaths and is being investigated further for possible linkage to the outbreak.The affected zone is located in a very remote and hard to reach and highly insecure area (classified as red zone due to local banditry). Despite arrangements made with the local authorities, insecurity slows down the investigations and response activities. In addition, a helicopter has been made available but its use has been limited due to bad weather and financial limitations.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "On 6 December, a 15 member multidisciplinary team from MoH, Institute Pasteur including public health professional, epidemiologist, entomologist and laboratory professional visited the affected area for epidemiological investigation and response activities.Key response activities already implemented include:Epidemiological investigations including active case finding and rapid diagnostic testingTraining of community health workers on community-based surveillance and early detection of casesClinical Management of suspected casesIdentification, follow up and chemoprophylaxis of contactsVector and reservoir control through the use of Kartman boxesSensitization of the populationStrengthening the community based surveillanceFree treatment of other diagnosed disease such as malariaStrengthening early detection in neighbouring districtsLaboratory confirmation",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Based on the available information to date, the risk of international spread appears unlikely, especially as it is occurring in very remote area. However, the difficulty to reach the affected area hampered prompt investigation and therefore at this stage the real magnitude of the outbreak is still to be defined and the risk of further spread in the area and sustained transmission cannot be formally ruled out. WHO continues supporting ongoing investigation and response activities.",
        "WHO Advice": "Further ecological investigations will be needed to understand the occurrence of a plague outbreak in an area which has not reported any cases of plague since 1950 in order to adapt long term surveillance and control measures.The outbreak impacts rural communities which have already suffered from remoteness and inadequate access to health services. Staff from MoH are supported by Pasteur Institute of Madagascar, who are all experienced on control measures. However, local conditions make their implementation complex.Due to the remoteness of the affected area and the conditions for getting infected by the disease, the current outbreak does not represent a significant risk for travellers.",

        "Outbreak name": "Influenza A H7N9 virus",
        "Date Reported": "3 January 2017",
        "Location": "China",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 30 December 2016, the Department of Health, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) notified WHO of a case of laboratory-confirmed human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus.Details of the caseThe case is a 70-year-old man with underlying chronic conditions, who travelled to Shenzhen and Zhongshan, Guangdong province from 13 to 16 December 2016. The patient reported having fever, productive cough, shortness of breath, vomiting and diarrhoea since 26 December. He visited a public hospital in Hong Kong SAR, China on 27 December and was admitted to an isolation ward on 28 December. A sputum sample taken on 28 December tested positive for avian influenza A(H7N9) virus RNA. The patient was in serious condition at the time of report.In Zhongshan, he passed by mobile stalls selling live poultry on 14 December but reported no direct contact with the poultry. In Hong Kong SAR, he purchased a chilled chicken from a shop near a wet market on 22 December but no live poultry was sold in the shop, and he did not enter the wet market. A total of 17 close contacts and 85 other contacts were identified as of 30 December, and put under medical surveillance. The patient\u2019s co-traveller had a cough since 29 December and was admitted to a public hospital on the same day. His respiratory specimen tested negative for avian influenza A(H7N9) virus RNA by the hospital. To date, a total of 809 laboratory-confirmed human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported through IHR notification since early 2013.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "The Centre for Health Protection of the Department of Health has taken the following measures:Urged the public to maintain strict personal, food and environmental hygiene both locally and during travel.Issued an alert to doctors, hospitals, schools and institutions of the latest situation.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Most human cases are exposed to avian influenza A(H7N9) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, including live poultry markets. Since the virus continues to be detected in animals and environments, further human cases can be expected. Although small clusters of human cases with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported including those involving healthcare workers, current epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans. Therefore further community level spread is considered unlikely.Human infections with the avian influenza A(H7N9) virus are unusual and need to be monitored closely in order to identify changes in the virus and/or its transmission behaviour to humans as it may have a serious public health impact.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid, if possible, poultry farms, contact with animals in live bird markets, entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water, and follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling in or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and influenza-like illness (ILI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005), and continue national health preparedness actions.",
