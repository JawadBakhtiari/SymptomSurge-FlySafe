        "Outbreak name": "Yellow fever",
        "Date Reported": "26 December 2019",
        "Location": "Mali",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "From 3 November through 8 December 2019, three laboratory confirmed cases of yellow fever including two deaths (case fatality rate = 67%) were detected through the national surveillance system in Mali. The first case-patient was a 15-year-old girl from a village in Kati district, Koulikoro region, Mali. The second and third case were in 17 and 25-year-old men, nationals from Cote d'Ivoire, living in the district of Bouguimi, Sikasso region, Mali. All three cases tested positive for yellow fever by Immunoglobulin M (IgM) and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on 3 December 2019 at Institute Pasteur Dakar (IPD). The first case was not vaccinated against yellow fever and had no travel history outside of Kati District. Meanwhile, the vaccination status for the other two cases was unknown.Additionally, there were nine suspected and three probable cases reported from the Bouguimi district, including three deaths among the probable cases.The age of the suspected, probable and confirmed cases ranges between 1 to 33 years, and the male to female ratio is 2:1. Among the reported symptoms, fever, jaundice and vomiting were the most common. Eight health areas of Bouguimi health district have been affected, with Manankoro (four cases) and Mafel\u00e9 (three cases) reporting the highest number. One suspected case is pending for confirmation at the Institute Pasteur Dakar laboratory.On 5 December 2019, the Government of Mali officially declared a yellow fever outbreak in two regions of Sikasso and Koulikoro.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "Setting up of an Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) for public health coordination of the outbreak in the regions of Sikasso, Koulikoro and the affected districts. In addition, EOC has been activated in Bamako city.A multidisciplinary rapid response team was deployed to conduct investigations in the affected districts of Sikasso and Koulikoro regions. A plan to conduct an in-depth entomological survey is underway.Enhanced epidemiological surveillance, including active case finding in both the affected districts has been strengthened.A comprehensive response plan is being developed with the specific objectives including preparation for an International Coordination Group (ICG) request to conduct a yellow fever reactive mass vaccination campaign.Provision of risk communication capacity through involvement of relevant stakeholders. Public communication and awareness efforts on yellow fever (signs, symptoms and vaccinations) including prevention measures.On 3 December 2019, a joint investigation team (WHO Country Office and Ministry of Health) was deployed to characterize the risk and develop an intervention plan. Field investigations indicate vaccination coverage under 80% in Kati and 88% in Manakoro districts.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Although population immunity in the southern regions of Mali has benefited from large-scale preventive mass vaccination campaigns in 2008 (5.8 million people protected) combined with nationwide children routine immunization since 2002, the overall national routine immunization coverage for yellow fever in 2018 was estimated to be 67%, with estimates nearly 80% in the non-desert areas (including the recently-affected Koulikoro and Sissako regions).This is below herd immunity thresholds and may indicate the presence of pockets of low immunity in the country. Kati district in Koulikoro region is located proximal to the capital city Bamako, an urban city with more than 2 million inhabitants, and Bouguimi district in Sikasso region borders with Cote d\u2019Ivoire.The high population movements within Mali, and across borders increases the risk of national and regional spread and that may have diluted the population immunity. The geographical distribution of the virus, coupled with suboptimal vaccination coverage, the presence of susceptible populations presents a risk of amplification. Furthermore, the protracted humanitarian crisis and concomitant ongoing outbreaks of epidemic-prone diseases (measles, dengue) may impact the response due to competing limited resources.Based on available information, WHO assesses the overall risk as high at the national level, moderate at the regional level, and low at the global level.",
        "WHO Advice": "Yellow fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes and has the potential to spread rapidly and cause serious public health impact. There is no specific treatment, although the disease is preventable using a single dose of yellow fever vaccine, which provides immunity for life. Supportive care to treat dehydration, respiratory failure and fever and antibiotic treatment for associated bacterial infections is recommendedMali is high priority country for Eliminate Yellow Fever Epidemic (EYE) strategy. Vaccination is the primary intervention for prevention and control of yellow fever. In urban centres, targeted vector control measures are also helpful to interrupt transmission. WHO and partners will continue to support local authorities to implement interventions necessary to control the current outbreak.WHO recommends vaccination against yellow fever for all international travellers more than 9 months of age going to areas south of the Sahara Desert in Mali. The vaccine is contraindicated in children aged less than 6 months and is not recommended for those aged 6\u20138 months, except during epidemics when the risk of infection with yellow fever virus may be very high. Other contraindications for yellow fever vaccination are severe hypersensitivity to egg and severe immunodeficiency. Caution is recommended before vaccinating people aged above 60 years against yellow fever.WHO does not recommend vaccination for travellers whose itineraries are limited to areas within the Sahara Desert. Vaccination is recommended, if indicated, for pregnant or breastfeeding women travelling to endemic areas when such travel cannot be avoided or postponed. Mali requires as a condition of entry a yellow fever vaccination certificate for all travellers aged one year or over.Yellow fever vaccines recommended by WHO are safe, highly effective and provide life-long protection against infection. In accordance with the IHR (2005), Third edition, the validity of the international certificate of vaccination against yellow fever extends to the life of the person vaccinated with a WHO approved vaccine. For both existing or new certificates, revaccination or a booster dose of yellow fever vaccine cannot be required of international travellers as a condition of entry into a State Party, regardless of the date their international certificate of vaccination was initially issued.On 1st July 2019, WHO updated the areas at-risk of yellow fever transmission and the corresponding recommendations for vaccination of international travelers. The list of countries at-risk, and revised recommendations for vaccination against yellow fever are available on the WHO website:\u00a0International travel and health (ITH).WHO encourage its Member States to take all actions necessary to keep travellers well informed of risks and preventive measures including vaccination. Travelers should also be made aware of yellow fever signs and symptoms and instructed to seek rapid medical advice should they develop signs of illness. Travellers returning to Mali who may be infected with possible high levels of the virus in the blood may pose a risk for the establishment of local cycles of yellow fever transmission in areas where the competent vector is present.WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel or trade to Mali on the basis of the information available on this outbreak.",

        "Date Reported": "19 December 2019",
        "Location": "Democratic Republic of the Congo",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "Eleven new confirmed cases were reported from 11 to 17 December in the ongoing Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces. The confirmed cases in this week were reported from three health areas in three health zones: Mabalako (82%,\u00a0n=9), Biena (9%,\u00a0n=1), and Butembo (9%,\u00a0n=1). This is the first confirmed case in Butembo Health Zone in 54 days.All 11 cases reported in the past seven days are linked to the case in Aloya Health Area, in which one individual was a potential source of infection for 28 people. Based on the preliminary sequencing of samples from this individual, this is being classified as a relapse of EVD. Rare cases of relapse - in which a person who has recovered from EVD gets disease symptoms again - have been documented during past outbreaks, but this is the first relapse documented in this outbreak.The volume of alerts reported has returned to levels seen before recent security incidents. The average proportion of contacts under surveillance in the last seven days has returned to previously observed levels. However, Mabalako, the health zone with the highest volume of contacts, has the lowest performance, with 82% of contacts under surveillance.In the past 21 days (27 November to 17 December), 47 confirmed cases were reported from 13 of the 102 (13%) health areas within six neighbouring active health zones in North Kivu and Ituri provinces (Figure 2, Table 1): Mabalako (66%,\u00a0n=31), Mandima (15%,\u00a0n=7), Beni (13%,\u00a0n=6), Butembo (2%,\u00a0n=1), Oicha (2%,\u00a0n=1), and Biena (2%,\u00a0n=1). The majority of the cases (94%,\u00a0n=44) are linked to known chains of transmission.As of 17 December, a total of 3351 EVD cases were reported, including 3233 confirmed and 118 probable cases, of which 2217 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 66%) (Table 1). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (n=1886) were female, 28% (n=941) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (n=169) were healthcare workers.In depth analysis: EVD in young childrenWHO periodically conducts in-depth epidemiological analyses so that data can help drive evidence-based improvements in response activities. A previous in-depth analysis of EVD cases in children aged under 5 years was presented in the\u00a0Disease Outbreak News in May 2019.As of 17 December 2019, over a quarter of all confirmed EVD cases have been children aged less than 18 years (28%, 898/3233). Children from 1-4 years of age accounted for 9% (293/3233) of reported EVD cases and children under 1 year of age accounted for 6% (182/3233) of reported cases. The age distribution of EVD cases has remained relatively constant throughout the outbreak. The case fatality ratio (CFR) among children aged 1-4 is 78% and among children under 1 year is 70%. These figures are similar to those observed in the 2014-16 West Africa EVD outbreak1.The data from this outbreak reveal a relationship between a person\u2019s age group and their pathway to care for EVD infection. Of persons who have died from EVD, death in the community occurred among 44% (80/182) of deaths among children under 1 year of age and 49% (145/294) of deaths among children 1-4 years of age. In contrast, 26% (575/2248) of deaths among persons aged 18 years or older were in the community. If a child infected with EVD presents to a HCF, they do so, on average, sooner than adults after symptom onset. Although they present sooner, the proportion of children with EVD being referred from a HCF to an ETC is lower than adults. Among all cases admitted to a HCF, 38% of cases aged 1-4 years and 32% of cases aged less than 1 year die outside of ETCs, without referral, compared to 15% of cases aged 18 years or older.The reasons for poor referral need to be further investigated, but might include, among others, the challenges for healthcare workers to recognise the symptoms of EVD in children and reluctance or concern by parents or guardians for children to be transferred to ETCs. However, when referral from HCF to an ETC does happen, this is done quickly across all age groups and the case fatality within ETCs is similar across all age groups.Of all confirmed EVD cases among children under 1 year of age, 47% (86/182) are registered as contacts; in children aged 1-4, 31% (91/293) are registered as contacts. The relative risk (RR) of not being known as a contact of an EVD case is significantly higher among paediatric cases compared to adults (age 18+), with a RR of 1.18 (95%CI: 1.03-1.35) among children aged less than 1 year and 1.49 (1.34-1.66) among children aged 1-4 years. In addition, the RR of not being a contact under follow up is higher among children aged 1-4 years (RR:1.22, 95%CI: 1.13-1.32), compared to adults.Social science analyses found that children were less often listed as contacts because of their parents\u2019 fears or concerns about referral to ETCs or vaccination, or they were not listed as contacts because of the parents\u2019 perception that children were not contacts and would not have been exposed. Among parents and healthcare workers, there appears to be limited understanding of transmission routes of EVD. There are ongoing efforts to better understand healthcare workers knowledge, attitudes, and understanding of risk factors for transmission among children.Specific actions are being taken to improve outcomes for children infected with EVD. Children of all ages that have suspected or confirmed EVD are cared for at ETCs with specific supportive care protocols. Paediatric equipment, medicines, and trained specialists are available to provide clinical support at ETCs. All eligible children with confirmed EVD are enrolled in investigational therapeutic protocols after informed consent is obtained. The Pamoja Tulinde Maisha (PALM [\u201cTogether Save Lives\u201d in the Kiswahili language]) randomized controlled trial enrolled 172 children under 18 years of age. Of these, 86 were below the age of 5, and in this age group both mAb114 and REGN-EB reduced mortality when coupled with optimized supportive care.Children also receive nutritional care and support from psychologists while in an ETC. This includes supporting and providing information related to infant feeding for children separated from their parents or orphaned due to EVD. Within ETCs, children are cared for by survivors at all times so that they are not alone. As with all age groups, infants and young children who survive EVD infection are offered support via a specialized programme of care for Ebola survivors. Pregnant women that have survived EVD are followed closely in the survivor program and return to ETCs for delivery by a multi-disciplinary team that has obstetric and paediatric expertise. To date, six healthy babies have been born to women who were pregnant at the time of EVD diagnosis and survived. UNICEF and partners are working with EVD survivors and creating infant and young child feeding counselling support groups. They are also supporting the screening and referral of malnourished children under 2 years of age. There is an ongoing effort design ETUs in a way that ensures care delivered to Ebola patients is patient-centred, especially for the most young and vulnerable.Partners are also working to improve the health of children in EVD-affected areas by strengthening the continuity of primary healthcare, supporting vaccination against preventable diseases, and preventing malaria through mosquito net distribution and the provision of antimalarial drugs.1Ebola Virus Disease among Children in West AfricaFigure 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by week of illness onset by health zone.

        "Date Reported": "17 December 2019",
        "Location": "Nigeria",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "Nigeria is responding to successive yellow fever outbreaks, with nearly a three-fold increase in number of confirmed cases in 2019 compared to 2018, suggesting intensification of yellow fever virus transmission. Additionally, there have been cases reported in parts of the country that have confirmed cases for the first time since the outbreak started in September 2017. From 1 January through 10 December 2019, a total of 4,189 suspected yellow fever cases were reported from 604 of 774 Local Government Area (LGAs) across all the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory in Nigeria.Of the total 3,547 samples taken, 207 tested positive for yellow fever by Immunoglobulin M (IgM) in Nigerian network laboratories. In addition, 197 samples from 19 states were confirmed positive using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The case fatality rate for all cases (including suspected, probable and confirmed) is 5.1%, and 12.2% for confirmed cases.Sixty-eight per cent (134 cases) of the total (197 cases) confirmed cases were reported from four states, including Bauchi, Katsina, Edo and Ebonyi. Cases in Edo state have declined after a reactive vaccination campaign in late 2018. From 1 January through 10 December 2019, a total of 115 confirmed cases and 23 deaths were reported from Bauchi (62 cases), Katsina (38 cases) and Benue (15 cases). These cases tested positive by RT-PCR at national laboratories and/or RT-PCR and serologic tests at a regional reference laboratory, Institute Pasteur Dakar (IPD). Further epidemiological investigations are underway.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "The outbreak response activities are being coordinated by a multi-agency yellow fever Incident Management System (IMS). On 5 November 2019, an Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) was activated for the third time, in response to the upsurge of confirmed yellow fever cases reported in a wide-geographic distribution including Bauchi, Benue and Katsina. A national rapid response team has been deployed to Bauchi and other affected states to support the outbreak response activities including surveillance, case management support and risk communications.In addition to the existing laboratories in the country, new and operational laboratories have been added to the national laboratory network in Abuja, Edo and Enugu states.A targeted response has been implemented in Alkaleri Local Government area (LGA) in Bauchi state. However, reports of ongoing transmission indicate that more vaccination and a wider geographical scope is needed. Katsina state has recently completed a state-wide preventive mass vaccination campaign; however, challenges linked to vaccine accountability and access to security-compromised areas may result in pockets of populations with immunity gaps. Risk of spread through population movements exist in neighbouring Kano and Kaduna states where population immunity is low.Nigeria is considered a high-risk country by the Eliminate Yellow Fever Epidemics (EYE) strategy. By 2024, it is anticipated that all the states in Nigeria will have undergone campaign activities to protect at-risk populations against yellow fever. This plan may be further updated or accelerated based on risk, vaccine and implementation feasibility. The country is in the process of completing a planned phase-3 vaccination campaign in 2019 and evaluating the recently concluded mass vaccination campaign.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "The yellow fever outbreak transmissions reported in Bauchi, Benue and Katsina states since August 2019, with spread to multiple other states, represents an intensification of yellow fever transmission and an elevated risk for yellow fever outbreak to spread and amplify. This is particularly a high risk if yellow fever is introduced into densely populated urban areas where preventive mass vaccination campaigns have not been conducted so far. Areas at risk include those without prior reported cases since 2017 and areas with a large number of under-immunized populations including urban areas such as Kano and Lagos. The preventive mass vaccination campaigns for yellow fever and the ongoing effort to strengthen routine immunization are important activities to reduce the risk of disease spread and amplification.WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and review the risk assessment based on the latest available information. Based on available information, WHO currently assesses the overall risk as high at the national level, moderate at the regional level, and low at the global level.Nigeria is facing several concurrent public health emergencies, including circulating vaccine-derived polio virus (cVDPV), measles, monkeypox, lassa fever, cholera outbreaks, and a humanitarian crisis in the north-east of the country.",
        "WHO Advice": "Yellow fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes and has the potential to spread rapidly, with serious public health impacts. There is no specific treatment, although the disease is preventable using a single dose of yellow fever vaccine, which provides lifetime immunity. Supportive care is required to treat dehydration, respiratory failure and fever; antibiotics are recommended to treat associated bacterial infections.The early detection and investigation of yellow fever cases through strong surveillance is key to controlling the risk of yellow fever outbreaks. Prevention of mosquito bites (e.g. repellents, wearing long clothes) is an additional measure that limits the risk of yellow fever transmission. In urban centres, targeted vector control measures are also helpful to interrupt transmission.WHO recommends vaccination against yellow fever for all international travelers more than nine months of age going to Nigeria, as there is evidence of persistent or periodic yellow fever virus transmission. Nigeria also requires a yellow fever vaccination certificate for travelers older than one year of age arriving from countries with risk of yellow fever transmission.Yellow fever vaccines approved by WHO are safe, highly effective and provide life-long protection against infection. In the context of international travel,\u00a0the amendment to Annex 7\u00a0of the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) changes the period of validity of the related international certificate of vaccination against yellow fever, and the protection provided by vaccination against yellow fever infection from ten (10) years to the life of the person (traveler) vaccinated. Accordingly, as of 11 July 2016, for both existing or new certificates, revaccination or a booster dose of yellow fever vaccine cannot be required of international travelers as a condition of entry into a State Party, regardless of the date their international certificate of vaccination was initially issued.On 1st July 2019, WHO updated the areas at-risk of yellow fever transmission and the corresponding recommendations for vaccination of international travelers. The list of countries at-risk, and revised recommendations for vaccination against yellow fever are available on the WHO website:\u00a0International travel and health (ITH).WHO encourages its Member States to take all actions necessary to keep travelers well informed of risks and of preventive measures, including vaccination. Travelers should also be made aware of yellow fever signs and symptoms and instructed to seek rapid medical advice should they develop signs of illness. Travelers returning to Nigeria who may be infected with possible high levels of the virus in the blood may pose a risk for the establishment of local cycles of yellow fever transmission in areas where the competent vector is present.WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel or trade to Nigeria on the basis of the information available on this outbreak.",

        "Description of the Situation": "Pacific Island Countries and Areas (PICs) are responding to outbreaks of measles with cases being reported for the first time since 2014\u00a01.A resurgence of measles cases has been seen in all WHO Regions since 2017. In the Asia Pacific Region, outbreaks of measles have been reported from countries where measles has previously been eliminated (including Australia, Cambodia, Japan, New Zealand, Republic of Korea) and in endemic countries with high incidence rates (including Lao PDR, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Viet Nam).The following is a brief update on the measles situation in Pacific Island Countries and Areas (PICs):SamoaOn 16 October 2019, the Samoa Ministry of Health (MoH) declared a measles outbreak with a state of emergency being declared on 15 November 2019. From 1 January through 4 December 2019, a total of 4,217 confirmed and suspected cases including 62 measles associated deaths have been reported, with the majority of cases reported among children under 5 years of age.In 2018, WHO-UNICEF estimated the national routine immunization coverage for measles-containing-vaccine first dose (MCV1) and measles-containing-vaccine second dose (MCV2) to be 31% and 13% respectively.TongaOn 22 October, the Tonga Ministry of Health declared a measles outbreak. The first cluster of cases was amongst teenage rugby players who had travelled to Auckland, New Zealand. The outbreak has been characterized by transmission in schools and has affected mainly teenage males and young adults. Eighty-four per cent (260 cases) of measles cases are reported in people between the ages of 10 and 24 years. As of 2 December 2019, a total of 440 cases of confirmed or suspected measles and no deaths have been reported. Most cases are males and have been reported from Tongatapu island. No measles-related deaths have been reported.In 2018, the Tonga Ministry of Health estimated the national routine immunization coverage for MCV1 and MCV2 to be over 95% in Tonga.FijiFrom 1 January through 3 December 2019, a total of 15 confirmed cases of measles have been reported; of which 11 cases were from, or were linked to cases in Serua/Namosi subdivision, two from Suva and two from Rewa subdivision. No measles-related deaths have been reported.In 2018, WHO-UNICEF estimated the national routine immunization coverage for MCV1 and MCV2 to be 94% in Fiji.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "The Ministry of Health in each affected country is coordinating response efforts with support from WHO and partners. A more detailed public health response by country is summarized below:SamoaOn 20 November 2019, Samoan authorities launched a mass vaccination campaign which initially targeted all boys and girls aged 6 months to 19 years and women aged 20 to 35 years (unless pregnant). On 2 December 2019, the target age group was expanded to include people aged 6 months to 60 years. As of 1 December 2019, over 77,000 doses of measles-containing-vaccine have been administered through the mass vaccination campaign initiated on 20 November by the Ministry of Health (MoH). Case management and clinical care services are overburdened, particularly the intensive care and paediatric wards in the main hospital of the capital Apia. International Emergency Medical Teams are supporting the clinical management of cases, and helping to train health workers.TongaOutbreak response immunization is ongoing for high risk groups, including secondary school students and children . As of 3 December 2019, over 15,000 people have been vaccinated with MCV as part of outbreak response efforts.FijiResponse activities are ongoing and over 100,000 people have been vaccinated in phase one of Supplemental immunization activities (SIA). The next round of SIA began on 4 December in key risk groups.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Measles is a highly contagious viral disease and remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among young children globally, despite the availability of a safe and effective vaccine. Globally, there has been an increasing trend of measles across all regions, with the resurgence of endemic measles and outbreaks in countries that had previously achieved elimination status. This reflects the risk that measles virus can spread when there is variability in immunization coverage at the district and local levels, or gaps in population immunity among specific sub-populations and marginalized groups. Infants too young to be vaccinated are at highest risk of measles; however, infants and those with medical contraindications to measles vaccination can be protected through herd (population) immunity when immunization coverage rates are high (> 95%). Infants, populations with poor access to health care services and co-morbidities such as malnutrition, including Vitamin A deficiency are more vulnerable to infection and at higher risk for severe disease.Population movement is a large factor in the spread of measles and this has been demonstrated through the reporting of imported cases in multiple countries in the region. Countries experiencing regular movement of tourists or overseas workers, in particular those travelling to and from measles-affected countries, are at risk for introduction of measles, and countries with district and local level immunization coverage below 95% are vulnerable to outbreaks.Each year, measles continues to be reported from the Western Pacific Region. The most recent outbreaks in the Western Pacific Region have been fuelled by low immunization coverage due to gaps in routine immunization programs.Given that many PICs are popular tourist destinations and with the upcoming holidays, the number of travellers is expected to increase. In addition, the risk of spread to neighbouring islands and other countries cannot be ruled out. Moreover, the PIC context is unique due to (1) the islands setting and relative geographic isolation, (2) large number of population movement between PICs and to other countries in the Region, (3) high interaction amongst people, (4) absence of noticeable measles virus circulation for many years in most PICs and therefore limited experience with case management, and (5) accumulation of susceptible populations in a number of PICs (vaccinated but non- immunized cohorts, suboptimal vaccination coverage in several PICs, and population immunity below herd immunity thresholds in others.",
        "WHO Advice": "Measles has a long incubation period with the average time from exposure to onset of early symptoms of about 10 - 12 days and from exposure to rash onset an average of 14 days (with a range of 7- 23 days), which means that international travel can be completed before an infected traveller becomes symptomatic. Case patients may be infectious from approximately 3 days prior to and 4 days after the rash erupts.Immunization is the most effective preventive measure against measles. High vaccination coverage of at least 95% with two doses of measles-containing-vaccine are recommended to ensure immunity.While there is no specific antiviral treatment for measles, vitamin A should be administered to all acute cases irrespective of the timing of previous doses of vitamin A. It is critical to quickly recognize and treat complications of measles in order to reduce mortality and severity of disease.Countries need to identify susceptible individuals and population groups and consider undertaking supplementary immunization activities to close immunity gaps. Tailored strategies to reach older populations and marginalized groups are important.Every opportunity should be used to vaccinate susceptible children, adolescents and adults. Measles-containing vaccines should also be recommended for susceptible persons intending to travel to countries where measles is endemic and where outbreaks are ongoing.Health care workers should be vaccinated to protect staff and the vulnerable populations they serve. Those with an uncertain vaccination status or unknown history of disease should have their immunity status checked and be vaccinated accordingly.With ongoing outbreaks in all regions, the WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific urges member states to refer to and implement the following published WHO guidance, which provides specific recommendations to strengthen preparedness and response to measles outbreaks. This includes detailed procedures for effective surveillance and investigation of acute rash and fever cases, and for rapid detection and containment of imported cases of measles:In particular, all countries in the Western Pacific Region - regardless of country context or whether they have achieved elimination of endemic measles transmission or are currently experiencing an outbreak - should urgently take the following actions:Identify coordination and leadership structures, mechanisms for preparedness and rapid response and lines of communication between local level, sub national and national level.Intensify measles surveillance to ensure measles cases are rapidly detected and public health measures implemented.Disseminate measles alerts reminding clinicians to be alert for measles, to implement airborne disease precautions, how to treat patients and how to ensure patient testing.Ensure contingency for human resources, available stocks of vaccine and injection devices, and operational funds are inventoried and accessible to support rapid outbreak investigation and response immunization if measles cases are detected.Ensure adequate infection prevention and control measures are in place in hospitals and other health facilities, including the ability to effectively triage and isolate patients. Clinical services should be well informed on how to identify simple and complicated measles and identify complications and those requiring admission versus those who can be managed at home.Update and inform clinicians on immunization schedules (including criteria for providing \u201czero-dose\u201d to infants older than 6 months, if applicable) and guidelines for immunization of travellers to measles-affected countries; case management protocols, especially the administration of vitamin A to all cases; and infection prevention and control procedures to prevent nosocomial measles spread.Update and inform the public about measles risks and prevention measures through risk communication with messages that are updated and adapted to the changing situation.In addition, the current global resurgence of measles is an urgent signal for countries to renew focus on implementing the strategies, activities, and procedures detailed in the Measles Elimination Field Guide and the Regional Strategy and Plan of Action to achieve sufficient population immunity to reduce the risk of outbreaks and prevent sustained endemic measles transmission. This guidance provides recommendations towards achieving overall high routine immunization coverage; and, identifying and vaccinating specific populations with elevated risk.",

        "Location": "Afghanistan",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 1 May 2019, in response to increasing numbers of dengue fever cases in Pakistan and India, health authorities in Afghanistan heightened monitoring for the disease. As part of this increased vigilance, the Central Public Health Laboratory (CPHL) in Kabul began to broaden its investigation for possible cases of the disease, such as reviewing samples that tested negative for Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) to see if they were positive for dengue.The laboratory performed differential diagnosis and tests on 40 samples that had tested negative for Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF). Between 1 October to 4 December 2019, 14 out of the 40 samples tested positive for dengue fever by the CPHL (13 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and one by Immunoglobulin M (IgM)). Of the 14 confirmed cases of dengue fever, seven were presumably autochthonous as the persons had no travel history to dengue endemic countries. One of the seven autochthonous cases died due to hemorrhagic fever. Six other cases had traveled to dengue endemic countries, including four people to Pakistan and two people to India. One case had an unknown travel history. Out of the 14 cases, 12 (86%) were males, between the age of 21 to 55 years old.The 14 cases were reported from six provinces: Faryab (1 case), Kabul (3 cases), and four provinces bordering Pakistan, where a large outbreak of dengue fever is ongoing: Paktita (1 case); Laghman (1 case); Paktya (2 cases); Nangarhar (6 cases).This is the first report of people with autochthonous \u2013 meaning locally acquired \u2013 cases of dengue fever in Afghanistan. Previous reports of dengue fever involved cases with travel history to dengue-endemic countries.In 2018, vector surveillance was conducted for the first time. The country authorities sent six mosquito samples from Khost Province in East Afghanistan to the WHO Collaborating Centre in Singapore for molecular confirmation of Aedes species. Four of them were identified as\u00a0Aedes albopictus. AdditionalAedes\u00a0mosquito samples from Khost and Nangarhar provinces were collected, which were morphologically identified as\u00a0Aedes albopictus\u00a0and\u00a0Aedesaegypti.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "A high-level emergency meeting led by the Deputy Minister of Policy and Planning was conducted on 25 November 2019 to address the current dengue situation.Ministry of Public Health drafted action points for response that included: coordination with the National Malaria and Leishmaniasis Control Program to identify high-risk areas, dengue surveillance; including vector surveillance, laboratory testing for dengue, case management, and deployment of Rapid Response Teams.The WHO country office, in collaboration with the Ministry of Public Health has drafted the National Plan for dengue and will conduct mapping of all diagnosed cases for future monitoring/ surveillance of the vector, with an aim to start vector control activities in the first quarter of 2020.WHO is assisting the Ministry in developing the case definition and guidelines for diagnosis and care for patients.WHO drafted the vector surveillance plan and further vector surveillance is ongoing in Khost province. This provides an opportunity to implement the required interventions for better response.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Dengue virus disease is an emerging mosquito-borne disease that has the potential to have serious public health impacts.This is the first time that autochthonous transmission of dengue fever has been reported in Afghanistan and is a cause for concern because of the serious public health impact of the disease.Afghanistan is experiencing a complex humanitarian emergency because of the ongoing conflict, frequent natural disasters, waves of population displacement, mass casualty incidents, and outbreaks of communicable diseases. Based on the Afghanistan Health Survey 2018, 57% population has access to primary health care (PHC) facility within half-hour distance, and 90% of the population has access to PHC facilities with a cumulative 2 hours distance. In addition, the country has limited capacity to prevent and control dengue outbreaks.The current cases of autochthonous dengue fever virus in the six affected provinces pose a risk to other areas in Afghanistan where the virus has not previously been recorded. Intense population movements during the rainy season pose an increased risk of spreading or intensifying the current dengue fever outbreaks.The lack of effective control programs in Afghanistan presents a challenge to the country\u2019s efforts to restrain the outbreak. Current winter conditions in Khost and Nangarhar provinces are expected to limit the proliferation of mosquitoes, thus reducing the risk of transmission. However, someAedes albopictus\u00a0mosquitoes have the ability to adapt to colder climates through the production of cold-resistant eggs, with temperate strains surviving cold winters in northern latitudes by hibernation.",
        "WHO Advice": "Prevention is the most effective approach to reducing the risk of dengue infection, as there is no specific treatment for the disease. The main methods of controlling or preventing the transmission of dengue virus aim to combat the mosquito vector through the following actions:Preventing mosquitoes from accessing egg-laying habitats by environmental management and modification (source reduction and chemical control measures).Disposing of solid waste properly and removing man-made habitats.Covering, emptying, and cleaning of domestic water storage containers.Applying appropriate insecticides to water storage in outdoor containers that cannot be cleaned.Use of personal and household protection such as mosquito repellents, window screens, long-sleeved clothing, mosquito nets and insecticide treated materials, coils, and vaporizers. Mosquito repellents should be applied to exposed skin or to clothing.Increasing community awareness, improving community participation, and mobilization for sustained vector control.Spraying insecticides during outbreaks as an emergency vector-control measure.Active monitoring and surveillance of vectors, with deployment of vector surveillance tools, should be carried out to determine effectiveness of control interventions.Careful clinical detection and management of dengue patients can significantly reduce mortality rates from severe dengue.WHO advises against any restrictions of travel or trade to or from Afghanistan based on the currently available information.",

        "Location": "Democratic Republic of the Congo",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "Twenty-seven new confirmed cases were reported from 4 to 10 December in the ongoing Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces. The confirmed cases in this week were reported from seven health areas in four health zones: Mabalako (67%,\u00a0n=18), Beni (22%,\u00a0n=6), Mandima (7%,\u00a0n=2), and Oicha (4%,\u00a0n=1). This is a substantial increase in the number of reported cases, compared to the average of seven confirmed cases for the previous three weeks. All of these cases are linked to three transmission chains. Of these 27 new cases, 20 (74%) were registered contacts, including 10 (37%) who were being followed up regularly. One community death was reported in an individual whose body was intercepted by response personnel at a point of control as they were being transported from Lwemba Health Area; a safe and dignified burial was performed. All other cases were referred to an Ebola Treatment Centre.The majority of these new cases are linked to a single chain of transmission, in which one individual was a potential source of infection for 17 people. This is the second documentation of EVD illness in this individual within a 6-month period. An investigation is ongoing to understand the circumstances around this case. Among the possibilities being investigated are reinfection and relapse. Reinfection would mean a person who has recovered from EVD is infected with EVD from another person; there has never been a documented case of this. Rare cases of relapse have been documented, in which a person who has recovered from EVD gets disease symptoms again.In the past week, there were six new cases among health workers; five of which were traditional practitioners, bringing the total number of health workers infected in this outbreak to 169 (5% of all reported cases).In Beni and Mabalako Health Zones, the overall average percentage of contacts under surveillance in the last seven days has returned to levels seen prior to the security events in past weeks. The volume of alerts and the proportion of alerts investigated within 24 hours has made similar improvements.In the past 21 days (20 November to 10 December), 42 confirmed cases were reported from 15 of the 71 (21%) health areas within four neighbouring active health zones in North Kivu and Ituri provinces (Figure 2, Table 1): Mabalako (60%,\u00a0n=25), Mandima (19%,\u00a0n=8), Beni (17%,\u00a0n=7), and Oicha (5%,\u00a0n=2). The majority of the cases (95%,\u00a0n=40) are linked to known chains of transmission. Mambasa Health Zone recently cleared 42 days without any new confirmed cases.As of 10 December, a total of 3340 EVD cases were reported, including 3222 confirmed and 118 probable cases, of which 2210 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 66%) (Table 1). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (n=1881) were female, and 28% (n=941) were children aged less than 18 years.Figure 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by week of illness onset by health zone.

        "Description of the Situation": "Nine new confirmed cases were reported from 27 November to 3 December in the ongoing Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces. The confirmed cases in this week were reported from Mandima (56%,\u00a0n=5) and Mabalako (44%,\u00a0n=4) Health Zones.In the past two weeks, violence, widespread civil unrest, and targeted attacks have severely disrupted the Ebola response and restricted access to affected communities in multiple locations. As a result, several key activities of the response experienced diminished performance, including the volume of reported and investigated alerts and the number of contacts registered and followed (Figure 1, Figure 2). The volume of alerts from health zones affected by insecurity is lower than usual, and this has led to an overall reduction in the average number of alerts reported in the last seven days. Of the 3346 alerts reported, 96% were investigated within 24 hours.The overall average percentage of contacts under surveillance in the last seven days is 70%, which is below the average for November prior to these security events (Figure 2). This is due mainly to performance being suboptimal in some areas of Beni, Mabalako, and Oicha Health Zones, with only 82% of contacts followed in Beni, 68% in Mabalako, and 42% in Oicha. These numbers are improving slowly since the events, but fluctuations illustrate the continued impact that security events have on response activities.In the past 21 days (13 November to 3 December), 22 confirmed cases were reported from 10 of the 71 health areas within four neighbouring active health zones in North Kivu and Ituri provinces (Figure 3, Table 1): Mabalako (55%,\u00a0n=12), Mandima (27%,\u00a0n=6), Beni (9%,\u00a0n=2), and Oicha (9%,\u00a0n=2). The majority of the cases (91%, n=20) are linked to known chains of transmission. In the past 21 days, a higher proportion of cases (31%,\u00a0n=8) have reported a funeral as their potential exposure to EVD compared to the average since January 2019 (7%); this is because of two separate community clusters in the health areas of Lwemba (six cases) and Bingo (two cases) linked to the burials of two probable cases.As of 3 December, a total of 3313 EVD cases were reported (Figure 4), including 3195 confirmed and 118 probable cases, of which 2207 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 67%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (n=1866) were female, 28% (n=936) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (n=163) were health workers.Figure 1: Alerts reported, investigated, and validated daily.

        "Date Reported": "29 November 2019",
        "Location": "Spain",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 6 November 2019, the Spanish authorities reported a likely sexual transmission of dengue between two men who have sex with men (MSM) in the municipality of Madrid in central Spain.The index case travelled to Cuba (28-30 August 2019) and then to the Dominican Republic (2-4 September 2019), both of which are endemic for dengue. He developed symptoms on 5 September 2019, the day after arrival to Spain from his second travel and reported having unprotected sex on 8 September 2019. His partner, the second case, developed symptoms on 15 September 2019 and had no history of travel outside of Spain in the 45 days prior to onset of symptoms.Semen samples taken from both cases tested positive for dengue virus by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and molecular investigations showed that the samples were genetically identical. Further investigation also showed the virus is similar to the dengue virus circulating in Cuba.In the absence of data supporting vector transmission or other known routes of transmission, the second case, with no travel history, is considered an autochthonous case who was most likely infected through sexual transmission. The case with travel history to Cuba and Dominican Republic is considered an imported dengue case from Cuba.Due to the incubation periods of dengue virus, both in humans (4 \u2013 10 days) and in mosquitoes (8 \u2013 12 days), transmission through \u201cluggage\u201d mosquitoes is very unlikely although it cannot be completely ruled out as a possible source of infection. This would also be a rare route of transmission.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "Following the notification of the cases, the Spanish authorities initiated response actions according to the surveillance protocols of the National Network of Epidemiological Surveillance as well as the Preparedness and Response plan for vector-borne diseases.Entomological investigations were conducted at the residence of the cases and its surroundings. No adult forms of the dengue competent vector (Aedes albopictus) were detected and no suitable breeding sites were identified. One other municipality in the Autonomous Community of Madrid, where cases spent one day, was also inspected for any indication of the presence of\u00a0Aedes\u00a0vectors, result of which was negative.A rapid risk assessment was conducted, and results were widely distributed within the National Health System. A review of case management recommendations is under consideration.This event was notified to the European Union's Early Warning and Response System (EWRS) as well as to the World Health Organization (WHO) under the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) on 6 November 2019.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "There has been only one documented case of probable female-to-male sexual transmission of dengue in the Republic of Korea in 2013\u00a01. There is no documented sexual transmission among MSM therefore this probable sexual route of transmission would be unusual. However, there is some evidence in the peer-reviewed literatures that DENV can be present in the semen of infected men or in vaginal secretions of infected women\u00a02.Subsequent vector borne dengue in Madrid, Spain is unlikely, since the vector is not established in the area where the cases reside. According to the data provided by the Spanish authorities, entomological surveillance which has been carried out in the Autonomous Community of Madrid since 2017, has detected the presence of\u00a0Aedes\u00a0mosquitoes in only one municipality (Velilla de San Antonio) which is far from any area visited by the cases. The upcoming winter season will also limit the vector activities.Dengue cases have been reported to the Spanish Surveillance Network over the past years: 198 in 2018; 132 in 2017, 262 in 2016, and 191 in 2015. Nearly all reported cases are imported with autochthonous cases reported for the first time in 2018 (six cases) and again in 2019(one case prior to the case included in this report). All seven autochthonous cases were acquired through vector-borne transmission and were reported from areas where\u00a0Ae. albopictus\u00a0is established (Autonomous Comunities of Murcia and Catalu\u00f1a) and they had no recent travel history to dengue-endemic areas.In 2004 the first\u00a0Ae. albopictus\u00a0mosquitoes were detected in Spain, in Catalonia. Since then the mosquitoes have been found along the coast southward, with recent detections in few municipalities in western Spain. There is evidence of low activity of\u00a0Ae. albopictus\u00a0during winter in Murcia. Entomological surveillance in the region shows the start of the mosquito population increased activity in spring, April or May, while reaching a peak in July or August. This is sometimes followed by a second peak in September.",
        "WHO Advice": "There is no specific treatment for dengue; however, a timely approach, the detection of cases, observing any warning signs of severe dengue, and case management are key elements of care to prevent patient deaths due to dengue. A delay in seeking medical care is often related to death.More research must be performed to determine the transmissibility of dengue by this route; to quantify the risk of sexual transmission and to identify risk factors in order to inform infectious disease clinicians and better advise travellers and population living in non-endemic and low-transmission endemic areas.Additionally, for areas where the vector is present, integrated vector management (IVM) activities should be enhanced to remove potential breeding sites, reduce vector populations, and minimize individual exposure. This should include both larval and adult vector control strategies (i.e. environmental management and source reduction and chemical control measures). Vector control measures should be implemented at households, places of work, schools, and healthcare facilities, amongst others, to prevent the vector-person contact.Given that Aedes mosquitoes, the competent vector, have greater activity during the day, personal protection measures are recommended such as the use of protective clothing that minimizes skin exposure and repellents that can be applied to exposed skin or clothes; the use of repellents must be in strict accordance with the label instructions. Window and door screens, and mosquito nets (infused or not with insecticide), can be useful to reduce the vector-person contact in closed spaces during the day or night.WHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions regarding events with no risk of international spread, including this event.",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "Six new confirmed cases were reported between 20 to 26 November in the ongoing Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces. Half of the confirmed cases in this week came from Mabalako Health Zone (50%,\u00a0n=3), and one case each came from Mandima, Oicha, and Beni Health Zones.In the past week, violence, widespread civil unrest, and targeted attacks have severely disrupted the Ebola response and restricted access to affected communities in multiple locations.On the night of 27 November, an attack on the Ebola response camp in Biakato Mines resulted in the deaths of three responders and the injury of six others. Staff were evacuated, and the majority of response activities in the area have been suspended. On the same night, a separate attack on the Ebola coordination office in Mangina resulted in the death of a police officer guarding the facility.Since 20 November, violence and civil unrest have limited response activities in Beni and Oicha. On 26 November, about one-third of WHO\u2019s Ebola response personnel in Beni were temporarily relocated to Goma. The disruptions to the response and lack of access to Ebola-affected communities are threatening to reverse recent progress. As seen previously during this outbreak, such disruptions often result in increased transmission and a subsequent rise in the number of cases due to impacts on surveillance and control efforts such as active case finding, contact tracing, and vaccination.Following insecurity, the volume of reported daily alerts from healthcare facilities and the community has dropped in Beni in the four-day period from 23 to 26 November from approximately 400 per day to 120-150 per day. Proportionally similar reductions in the number of alerts have also been observed in Butembo, following two days of protests. In addition, recent security events have had an impact on contact tracing activities, which involves monitoring registered contacts of EVD cases for signs of infection, particularly in Oicha where only 15% of contacts were under surveillance as of 26 November. The overall average percentage of contacts under surveillance in the last 7 days is 86%, but it dropped as low as 59% on 25 November. These are essential functions of the response that are well known to reduce the risk of spread of the virus, and the fluctuations in performance following insecurity may enable new chains of transmission.In the past 21 days (6 to 26 November), 19 confirmed cases were reported from four neighbouring, active health zones in North Kivu and Ituri provinces (Figure 2, Table 1): Mabalako (63%,\u00a0n=12), Beni (21%,\u00a0n=4), Oicha (11%,\u00a0n=2), and Mandima (5%,\u00a0n=1). The majority of the cases (95%,\u00a0n=18) are linked to known chains of transmission. In the previous 21 day period (16 October to 5 November), 55 confirmed cases were reported from seven health zones.As of 26 November, a total of 3304 EVD cases were reported, including 3186 confirmed and 118 probable cases, of which 2199 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 67%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (n=1862) were female, 28% (n=935) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (n=163) were health workers.Figure 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by week of illness onset by health zone.

        "Description of the Situation": "Many countries around the world are experiencing measles outbreaks. As of 5 November 2019, there have been 413,308 confirmed cases reported to WHO through official monthly reporting by 187 Member States in 2019.Figure 1: Measles case distribution by month and WHO Region (2015-2019), Data as of 8 November 2019*Data Source: IVB Database - This is surveillance data, hence for the last month(s), the data may be incomplete.The following is a brief update on the global measles situation based on information shared by Member States with WHO. Note that this is an evolving situation and data is constantly updated. Data below are based on the latest information available to\nWHO.African RegionLarge measles outbreaks are being reported in several countries in the region. Outbreaks are ongoing in Madagascar and Nigeria ; although the rate of new cases is decreasing, cases are still being reported weekly. As of 17 November 2019, a total of 250,270\nsuspected cases with 5,110 associated deaths have been reported by the Democratic Republic of the Congo, an increase in more than 8,000 cases compared to the previous week. All provinces are affected, and a national outbreak response vaccination campaign\nis ongoing in phases and should be completed by the end of the year. As of 13 November, Guinea had 4,690 suspected measles cases, 1,091 of which were confirmed. Outbreak vaccination response activities are underway. As of 17 November 2019, Chad had\nreported 25,596 suspected cases in 94% of their districts; outbreak response vaccination is planned.Eastern Mediterranean RegionFrom 1 January through 17 November 2019, Lebanon reported 1,060 confirmed cases of measles1\u00a0(For more information, please see\u00a0Disease Outbreak News (DON) published on measles in Lebanon on 22 October 2019).\nAs of 8 November 2019, current outbreaks of concern include Yemen with 5,847 confirmed cases, Sudan with 3,659 confirmed cases, Somalia with 2,795 cases, Pakistan with 1,978 confirmed cases, Tunisia with 1,367 cases, and Iraq with 1,222 cases of measles.European RegionMany countries in Europe experienced large outbreaks in 2019. From 1 January through 5 November 2019, Ukraine has reported 56,802 cases, followed by Kazakhstan with 10,126 cases, Georgia with 3,904 cases, Russian Federation with 3,521 cases, Turkey with\n2,666 cases, and Kyrgyzstan with 2,228 cases of measles. Some of these outbreaks (e.g. Georgia, Russian Federation, Turkey) have resolved.Region of the AmericasFrom 1 January through 9 November 2019, Brazil reported 11,887 confirmed cases of measles, with the majority of cases in Sao Paulo. A vaccination response is underway.During the same time, Venezuela reported 520 measles cases with no new case being reported in the last 14 weeks. Colombia has reported 215 cases which were likely acquired in Venezuela. In the United States, two large sustained outbreaks in New York State\nhave also been declared over; however, small outbreaks are still occurring in other states within the United States.\u00a02South-East Asia RegionFrom 1 January through 18 November, Bangladesh has reported 4,181 confirmed cases of measles. Much of the current, growing outbreak is centered in Rohingya refugee camps in Cox\u2019s Bazaar; vaccination efforts continue. Myanmar has had 5,286 cases\nthough their outbreak appears to be resolving after two rounds of outbreak response immunization. A nationwide vaccination campaign for children aged 9-65 months is ongoing. There is a need to also vaccinate previously unreached adults to stop the\ncurrent ongoing transmission.During the same time, Thailand reported 4,852 cases, and a vaccination campaign targeting children between 1-12 years of age is ongoing; however, there is a need to conduct vaccination campaigns for susceptible populations born between 1984 to 2000 as\nwell as migrant populations in industrial areas, people participating in travel and tours company and such other establishments.Western Pacific RegionOutbreaks in the Philippines and Viet Nam earlier in 2019 drove the increase in cases in the Region, but new cases are decreasing in these countries. As of 20 November 2019, current outbreaks include New Zealand with 2,084 confirmed cases, of which 80%\nare in the Auckland region\u00a03\u00a0; Cambodia has 490 cases with cases occurring in all provinces.From 1 January through 23 November 2019, multiple countries in the Pacific Islands are experiencing outbreaks including Tonga (310 cases), Fiji (10 cases)4\u00a0, and American Samoa (2 cases). As of 26 November, the Samoa Ministry of Health confirmed\na total of 2,437 cases and 32 associated deaths, with 243 new cases reported within the last 24 hours\u00a05\u00a0. These islands are conducting outbreak response activities and mitigation measures, including vaccination campaigns.",

        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Measles is a highly contagious viral disease which affects susceptible individuals of all ages and remains one of the leading causes of death among young children globally, despite the availability of safe and effective measles-containing vaccines. It is transmitted via droplets from the nose, mouth, or throat of infected persons. Initial symptoms, which usually appear 10\u201312 days after infection, include high fever, usually accompanied by one or several of the following: runny nose, conjunctivitis, cough and tiny white spots on the inside of the mouth. Several days later, a rash develops, starting on the face and upper neck and gradually spreads downwards. A patient is infectious four days before the start of the rash to four days after the appearance of the rash. Most people recover within 2\u20133 weeks.Even with implementation of routine immunization, measles continues to circulate globally due to suboptimal vaccination coverage and population immunity gaps. Any community with less than 95% population immunity is at risk for an outbreak. If an outbreak response is not timely and comprehensive, the virus will find its way into more pockets of vulnerable individuals and potentially spread within and beyond the affected countries.The impact on public health will persist until the ongoing outbreaks are controlled, routine immunization coverage is continuously high (\u2265 95%) and immunity gaps in the population are closed. As long as measles continues to circulate anywhere in the world, no country can be assured to avoid importation. However, countries can protect their populations through high vaccine coverage achieved primarily through routine immunization programmes, and where necessary through supplemental immunization activities designed to assure that susceptible individuals are vaccinated.",
        "WHO Advice": "Immunization is the most effective preventive measure against measles. Two doses of measles-containing-vaccine are recommended to ensure immunity.While there is no specific antiviral treatment for measles,prompt provision of vitamin A is recommended by WHO for all children infected with measles. It is critical to quickly recognize and treat complications of measles in order to reduce mortality and severity of disease.WHO urges all Member States to do the following:Maintain high measles vaccination coverage (\u2265 95%) with two doses of measles-containing-vaccine, in every district;Offer vaccination to individuals who do not have proof of vaccination or immunity against measles, and who are at risk of infection and transmission of the virus, such as healthcare workers, people working in tourism and transportation, and international travelers;Strengthen epidemiological surveillance for cases of \u2018fever with rash\u2019 for timely detection of all suspected cases of measles in public and private healthcare facilities;Ensure that collected blood samples from suspect measles cases appropriately tested by laboratories within five days;All countries need to provide a rapid response to imported measles cases to prevent the establishment or re-establishment of endemic transmission;Recognize complications early and provide comprehensive treatment to reduce the severity of disease and avoid unnecessary deaths.Administer vitamin A supplementation to all children diagnosed with measles to reduce the complications and mortality (two doses of 50, 000 IU for a child less than 6 month of age, 1,00, 000 IU for children between 6 and12 months of age or 2, 00, 000 IU for children 12-59 months, immediately upon diagnosis and on the following day.Ensure health care workers are vaccinated in order to avoid infections acquired in a health care setting.",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 10 October 2019, the Sudan International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Point (NFP) notified WHO of 99 suspected cases of dengue fever in Kassala State. The first reported case presented to the health facilities on 8 August 2019 with symptoms including high-grade fever, headache, and joint pain, with or without vomiting.From 8 August through 4 November 2019, a total of 1,197 suspected cases of dengue fever including five deaths have been reported from seven states: Kassala (1,111 cases; 3 deaths), West Darfur (43 cases; 1 death), North Darfur (29 cases; 1 death), Red Sea (9 cases; 0 deaths), South Darfur (3 cases; 0 deaths), Gadarif (1 case; 0 deaths) and North Kordofan (1 case; 0 deaths).One hundred twenty-five samples have been tested for Dengue fever, out of which 71 (57%) tested positive at the National Public Health Laboratory in Khartoum, by Immunoglobulin M (IgM) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Fifty-four percent of cases were female and 93% of cases were above the age of 5 years. Of the 1,197-suspected cases of dengue fever, 95 cases (7.9%) showed hemorrhagic manifestations.Figure 1. Spread of dengue in chronological order in the seven states",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "The following public health response measures have been implemented:A task force committee has been activated at federal level from 1 August 2019.Surveillance teams have been trained and deployed for daily reporting and active case finding in the affected areas, as of 17 August.Enhanced surveillance and daily reporting have been initiated in 158 sentinel-reporting sites in all localities. Outbreak investigation teams at state and local levels have been reactivated, and all the reported cases have been investigated.Prevention and vector control measures are being applied to the houses of reported cases and surrounding houses.WHO and Sudan Ministry of Health trained 220 health workers in all localities in Kassala State on surveillance, case definition and case management protocols.WHO provided 2,000 ringer lactate drips and 500 doses of paracetamol to fill the gaps in case management supplies.Vector control interventions have been conducted: in Port Sudan, Red Sea State, a total of 1,225 households were inspected, of which 29 were found positive for the presence of\u00a0Aedes\u00a0mosquitoes and fogging was done in 1,949 households.WHO supported the printing and distribution of dengue fever case definition and case management protocols in the main hospitals of Kassala State.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Dengue Fever is endemic in Sudan. Several outbreaks have been documented in 2010, 2013 and 2017. Information on the circulating dengue virus serotypes in Sudan is not available. In this regard, more investigation on the dengue virus (DENV) needs to be conducted.The current dengue fever outbreak is coinciding with other ongoing outbreaks of chikungunya, rift valley fever, malaria, and cholera. Control and response capacities of the public health sector is limited; years of political and civil conflicts have reduced the country capacity to control and prevent outbreaks.Since the start of the outbreak on 8 August 2019, dengue has spread to seven states across the country. To date, five deaths have been reported. The high likelihood of co-infection with chikungunya and/or malaria complicates case management and may result in poor prognosis.The risk of international spread of dengue fever virus is high due to the presence of suitable mosquito vectors (Aedes\u00a0) in the neighboring countries; which are also experiencing floods and seasonal heavy rains, as well as lack of effective vector control programs. Port Sudan, the capital of Red Sea State, is the most important port of the Red Sea with a high volume of international trade and traffic that could potentially lead to further international spread.",
        "WHO Advice": "The proximity of mosquito breeding sites to human habitations is a significant risk factor for dengue virus infection. There is no specific treatment for dengue infection but early detection and access to proper medical care lowers mortality. Efforts must be made to brief all health workers on the warning signs for severe dengue so that early detection and case management can help reduce deaths. Implementation of effective vector control measures is also critical to dengue prevention and control.WHO promotes a strategic approach known as Integrated Vector Management (IVM) to control mosquito vectors, including\u00a0Aedes\u00a0spp (the primary vector for dengue). IVM activities should be enhanced to remove potential breeding sites, reduce vector density, and minimize individual exposures. This should include both larval and adult vector control strategies (i.e. environmental management, source reduction and chemical control measures), as well as strategies to protect individuals and households. Vector control activities should target all settings where human\u2013vector contact occurs (place of residence, workplaces, schools, and hospitals).Vector control activities may include covering, emptying, and cleaning of all domestic water storage containers on a weekly basis. In addition, recommended insecticides can be used to outdoor water storage containers. Control measures should also target places of work and schools since\u00a0Aedes\u00a0mosquitoes bite during the day.Where indoor biting occurs, household aerosol products, mosquito coils or other insecticide vaporizers may reduce biting activity. Household fixtures such as windows, door screens and air conditioning units can also reduce biting. Personal protective measures, such as use of clothing that minimizes skin exposure during daylight hours is recommended. Repellents may be applied to exposed skin or to clothing. Insecticide-treated mosquito nets afford good protection against mosquito bites while sleeping, especially for those who sleep during the day (e.g. infants, people confined to beds due to illness or age, dengue patients, and night-shift workers).Vector surveillance and case tracking should continue to be strengthened within all affected areas and at the national level. Vector surveillance should provide guidance to control efforts and assess impact.Key public health communication messages on reducing the risk of dengue transmission should continue to be provided through the mass media, health centers, and other public area.WHO advises against any restrictions of travel or trade to or from Sudan based on the currently available information.",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 13 November 2019, the Venezuela International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Point (NFP) and the Venezuela PAHO/WHO Country Office shared information about a confirmed case of yellow fever in Bolivar State. The case-patient is a 46-year-old male resident of the municipality of Gran Sabana, Bolivar State. He was in the locality of Uriman municipality of Gran Sabana within the 19 days prior to the onset of symptoms. Symptom onset was on 14 September 2019, and included fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, epistaxis, petechiae, and diarrhoea. On 26 September 2019, he visited a public hospital in the municipality of Heres where his condition deteriorated, with moderate dehydration, bleeding from the gums, jaundice, choluria, abdominal pain, and hepatomegaly. As of 13 November 2019, the patient remains hospitalized with chronic renal failure and moderate anaemia.On 26 September 2019, the first serum sample was sent to the National Reference Laboratory, the National Institute of Hygiene \u201cRafael Rangel\u201d per its acronym in Spanish, IHRR1\u00a0, in Caracas. On 13 November 2019, the sample tested positive for yellow fever by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and negative for dengue on 14 November 2019 by RT-PCR. On 10 October 2019, a second serum sample was taken and sent to the IHRR; for which the results are still pending.Most of the territory of Venezuela is considered as at risk for sylvatic yellow fever and this case marks the first confirmed autochthonous case of yellow fever diagnosed in Venezuela since 2005.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "A joint investigation team (WHO Country Office and the Venezuela Ministry of Health) was deployed on 12 November to characterize the risk and develop the response plan. PAHO Immunizations (IM) Unit along with the Revolving Fund have secured a donation of 571,000 doses of yellow fever vaccine from UNICEF that arrived in the country at the end of October (for more information, please see\u00a0here).The local public health authorities have strengthened the active and passive epidemiological surveillance activities in humans and non-human primates. Additionally, strategic vaccination activities have been planned.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Yellow fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes and has the potential to spread rapidly and cause serious public health impact. There is no specific treatment, although the disease is preventable using a single dose of yellow fever vaccine, which provides immunity for life. Supportive care is required to treat dehydration, respiratory failure, and fever; and antibiotics are recommended to treat associated bacterial infections.The origin of the infection of this case is likely to be sylvatic, in an area determined as at risk for yellow fever. Venezuela is considered at risk for yellow fever transmission.",
        "WHO Advice": "This yellow fever case report illustrates the importance of maintaining awareness and strong surveillance systems (including laboratory capacity) and high coverage of yellow fever vaccination, especially in areas with a favourable ecosystem for yellow fever transmission and Indigenous groups.Advice to travelers planning to visit, or reside in, areas at risk for yellow fever transmission includes:Vaccination against yellow fever at least 10 days prior to the travel is recommended for all travelers aged 9 months or above traveling to Venezuela, except for travelers whose itineraries are limited to the following areas: the entire states of Aragua, Carabobo, Miranda, Vargas and Yaracuy, and the Distrito Federal. It is not recommended for travelers whose itineraries are limited to the following areas: all areas above 2300 m in the states of Merida, Trujillo and Tachira; the states of Falcon and Lara; Margarita Island; the capital city of Caracas; and the city of Valencia (please see the map\u00a0here).The vaccine is contraindicated in children aged under 6 months and is not recommended for those aged between 6\u20138 months, except during epidemics when the risk of infection with yellow fever virus may be very high.Caution is recommended before vaccinating people aged \u2265 60 years against yellow fever, and a risk-benefit assessment should be performed for any person \u2265 60 years of age who has not been vaccinated and for whom the vaccine is normally recommended.A single dose of WHO approved yellow fever vaccine is sufficient to confer life-long protection against yellow fever disease. A booster dose of the vaccine is not needed.Yellow fever virus may be transmitted not only in areas of high endemicity but also in areas of low endemicity if a traveler\u2019s itinerary results in heavy exposure to mosquitoes (e.g. during prolonged travel in rural areas). WHO recommends as a general precaution to avoid mosquito bites; the highest risk for transmission of yellow fever virus is during the day and early evening.A yellow fever vaccination certificate is required for travelers aged one (1) year of age or older, arriving from Brazil, and for travelers having transited for more than 12 hours through an airport in Brazil. Travelers should be aware that the absence of a requirement for vaccination does not imply that there is no risk of exposure to yellow fever in the country. Vaccination coverage in some populations might be suboptimal, particularly among indigenous communities.International certificates of vaccination against yellow fever become valid 10 days after primary vaccination and remain valid for the duration of the life of the person vaccinated. A booster dose after 10 years is not necessary for protection and can no longer be required for international travelers as a condition of entry into a country (for more information, please see\u00a0here).Awareness of symptoms and signs of yellow fever.Promotion of health care seeking advice while traveling and upon return from an area at risk for yellow fever transmission, especially to a country where the establishment of a local cycle of transmission is possible (i.e. where the competent vector is present).WHO encourages Member States to take all actions necessary to keep travelers well informed of risks and of preventive measures including vaccination. Travelers should also be made aware of yellow fever signs and symptoms and be instructed to seek rapid medical advice when presenting signs after possible exposure.WHO reminds Members States to strengthen the control checks of immunization status of travelers to all potentially endemic areas. Viraemic returning travelers infected in endemic areas may pose a risk for the establishment of local cycles of yellow fever transmission in areas where a competent vector is present. If there are medical grounds for not getting vaccinated, this must be certified by the appropriate authorities.WHO does not recommend any general travel or trade restrictions be applied to Venezuela based on the information available for this event.",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "Seven new confirmed cases were reported in the past week (13 to 19 November) in the ongoing Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces. After more than 30 days with no new cases, Oicha Health Zone reported a new confirmed EVD case, which was a community death. This case had links to Kalunguta, Mandima, Mabalako, and Oicha Health Zones and was transported within Beni Health Zone after death. A multidisciplinary team has commenced investigation of this chain of transmission. The source of exposure is yet to be identified; samples have been sent to the laboratory in Katwa Health Zone for sequencing to support the identification of the source case. All other cases reported in Beni and Mabalako Health Zones in the past week have been linked to known chains of transmission.This week, security incidents attributed to armed conflict occurred in multiple areas included in the response, including Beni, Oicha, and Kyondo Health Zones. These were primarily due to ongoing military operations against non-state armed groups and retaliatory attacks on the local population. Although there have not been any reports of violence aimed at the response, the insecurity and related protests by communities led to the suspension of response activities in some areas of Beni, Butembo, and Oicha Health Zones. This violence and the disruptions to the response are threatening to reverse recent progress. As seen previously during this outbreak, such disruptions limit contact tracing and surveillance efforts and often result in increased transmission.In the past 21 days (30 October to 19 November), 28 confirmed cases were reported from four active health zones in North Kivu and Ituri provinces (Figure 2, Table 1) with the majority reported in three health zones: Mabalako (50%,\u00a0n=14), Beni (29%,\u00a0n=8), and Mandima (18%,\u00a0n=5). The majority of the cases (93%,\u00a0n=26) are linked to known chains of transmission. The largest of the two active chains of transmission includes two cases who were both symptomatic in the community for a long period of time, which led to secondary and tertiary transmission. Mambasa and Butembo Health Zones passed 21 days with no new confirmed cases reported.As of 19 November, a total of 3298 EVD cases were reported, including 3180 confirmed and 118 probable cases, of which 2197 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 67%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (n=1859) were female, 28% (n=931) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (n=163) were health workers.Figure 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by week of illness onset by health zone.

        "WHO Risk Assessment": "WHO continuously monitors changes to the epidemiological situation and context of the outbreak to ensure that support to the response is adapted to the evolving circumstances. The last assessment concluded that the national and regional risk levels remain very high, while global risk levels remain low.While the relatively lower case incidence observed is encouraging, it must be interpreted with caution as the situation remains highly contingent upon the level of access and security within affected communities. Concurrent with the decline in case incidence, there was a shift in hotspots from urban settings to more rural, hard-to-reach communities, within a more concentrated geographical area. These areas bring additional challenges to the response, including an extremely volatile security situation, difficulty accessing some remote areas, delays to engaging with the community which in turn lead to mistrust and misunderstandings, and potential under-reporting of cases. The recent security events and disruption of response activities underscore the fact that the risk of resurgence remains very high, as do the risks of re-dispersion of the outbreak with cases travelling outside of hotspots to seek healthcare or for other reasons. These risks continue to be mitigated by the substantial response and preparedness activities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and neighbouring countries, with support from a consortium of international partners.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. Any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for travellers to/from the affected countries. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.

        "Location": "Sudan",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 10 October 2019, the National IHR Focal Point for Sudan notified WHO of 47 suspected cases of Rift Valley Fever (RVF), including two deaths in Arb\u2019aat Area, Towashan Village, in El Qaneb locality, Red Sea State. The suspected cases presented with high-grade fever, headaches, joint pain, vomiting. There were no hemorrhagic signs or symptoms observed. The first case presented to the health facility on 19 September 2019.On 28 September 2019, a total of 14 samples were sent to the National Public Health Laboratory in Khartoum, and 5 tested positive for RVF by Immunoglobulin M (IgM) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). These samples were also tested for malaria and were found negative.On 13 October 2019, a total of 10 suspected RVF cases were recorded in Barbar and Abu Hamed localities, of River Nile State. Of the 10 suspected RVF cases, five samples were tested and four were found positive for RVF. From 19 September 2019 until 11 November 2019, a total of 293 suspected human RVF cases, including 11 associated deaths have been reported from six states; including the Red Sea (120), River Nile (168), Kassala (2), White Nile (1), Khartoum (1), and Al Qadarif (1) States. The most affected age group is 15-45 years old, which accounts for 83% of the total suspected cases. The male to female ratio is 2.6, with a high proportion of the cases being farmers (37.5%).These human RVF cases are concomitant with abortions and deaths among goats in the areas where the human suspected and confirmed cases have been reported. From 25 September through 3 November 2019, 21 goats in Red Sea State were reported as positive for RVF, including 4 deaths; and in River Nile State 16 goats, with 3 deaths, and 37 sheep, with 5 deaths, were confirmed positive for RVF by ELISA test at the Central Veterinary Research Laboratory in Khartoum.",

        "WHO Risk Assessment": "RVF is endemic in Sudan. Three outbreaks affecting humans have been previously documented in 1973, 1976, and 2008. During the outbreak in 2008, a total of 747 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported, including 230 deaths.The recent floods, following heavy rains on 13 August 2019, caused flash floods in 17 of the 18 states, including Abyei area in West Kordofan State. These floods have favored vector abundance, distribution, and longevity. The current RVF outbreak started on 19 September 2019 and has affected six states impacted by the floods.The uncontrolled movements of animal populations within and outside the country borders may increase the spread of the disease to new areas.RVF can cause significant economic losses due to livestock travel and trade restrictions, as well as high mortality and abortion rates among infected animals.In a country where export of livestock is one of the major sources of the national income, the current RVF outbreak, in the context of political unrest and a debilitated health system requires an urgent need for external assistance.",
        "WHO Advice": "Rift Valley Fever (RVF) is a mosquito-borne viral zoonosis that primarily affects animals, but also has the capacity to infect humans. The majority of human infections result from direct or indirect contact with the blood or organs of infected animals. Herders, farmers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians have an increased risk of infection.Awareness of the risk factors of RVF infection and measures to prevent mosquito bites is the only way to reduce human infection and deaths. Public health messages for risk reduction should focus on:Reducing the risk of animal-to-human transmission resulting from unsafe animal husbandry and slaughtering practices.Practicing hand hygiene as well as wearing gloves or other personal protective equipment when handling sick animals or their tissues and when slaughtering animals.Reducing the risk of animal-to-human transmission arising from the unsafe consumption of raw or unpasteurized milk or animal tissue. In endemic regions, all animal products should be thoroughly cooked before eating.Reducing the risk of mosquito bites through the implementation of vector control activities (e.g. insecticide spraying and use of larvicidal to reduce mosquito breeding sites), use of insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets and repellents, light- colored clothing (long-sleeved shirts and trousers).Restricting or banning the movement of livestock to reduce the spread of the virus from infected to uninfected areas.Routine animal vaccination is recommended to prevent RVF outbreaks. Vaccination campaigns are not recommended during an outbreak as they may intensify transmission among the herd through needle propagation of the virus.Outbreaks of RVF in animals precede human cases, thus the establishment of an active animal health surveillance system is essential in providing early warning for veterinary and public health authorities.WHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions with the affected country based on the current information available on this event.",

        "Description of the Situation": "Fifteen confirmed cases were reported in the past week (30 October \u2013 5 November) in the ongoing Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces. While the number of new cases is consistent with the weekly average of 19 confirmed\ncases in the past 21 days, there is notable daily fluctuation of cases.Violence this week in Lwemba Health Area in Mandima Health Zone caused the death of an Ebola response community health worker and left his spouse critically injured. WHO and partners condemned the attack, adding that acts of violence against individuals\ninvolved with the response are unacceptable and compromise the ability of health workers to assist communities impacted by the devastating effects of Ebola.During the past 21 days (16 October \u2013 5 November), 54 confirmed cases were reported from seven active health zones in North Kivu and Ituri provinces (Figure 2, Table 1) with the majority reported in four health zones: Mandima (39%,\u00a0n=\u00a021),\nMabalako (31%,\u00a0n=\u00a017), Beni (11%,\u00a0n=\u00a06) , and Mambasa (11%,\u00a0n=\u00a06). The vast majority (83%) of these cases were linked to Biakato Mines Health Area in Mandima Health Zone, with the remaining\n10 cases linked to known chains of transmission in Binase, Katwa and Lwemba Health Areas.In this context, reintroduction into previously cleared or unaffected neighbouring areas can be expected and possible geographical spread should be closely assessed and monitored. Approximately half (51%) of the cases reported in the past 21 days were\nlocated outside of the health zone where they had got infected, with the majority of these movements going to or coming from Mandima Health Zone. An analysis of population movement indicates that travel within the region is directed eastward from\nMambasa to Komanda and towards Bunia, southward between Mambasa and Mangina, and further south and south-east through Beni to Butembo, and all the way to Kasindi and crossing into Uganda. Points of entry and points of control continue to be strengthened\nby response teams based on movement of cases and populations. This week, a case was detected while traveling through a newly-opened point of control, reinforcing the importance of enhancing screening along these major passages, transitways and border\npoints. An example of reinforcement activities underway is the introduction of a EVD laboratory in Kasindi Health Area in the past week, close to the border with Uganda. This will facilitate the rapid identification of cases and earlier initiation\nof response activities.As of 5 November, a total of 3285 EVD cases were reported, including 3167 confirmed and 118 probable cases, of which 2191 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 67%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (n=\u00a01852) were female,\n28% (n=\u00a0930) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (n=\u00a0163) were health workers.Figure 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by week of illness onset by health zone.

        "Location": "France",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 9 October 2019, the French authorities reported an autochthonous Zika virus (ZIKV) case in Hyeres, Var department, France. The case had reported symptom onset on 29 July 2019. No travel history to Zika endemic countries was reported for the patient or partner. Since this notification, French authorities reported an additional two probable autochthonous ZIKV cases, identified through active case finding, in Hyeres, in the same area and same timeframe (symptom onsets of the three cases from 6 to 15 August 2019). All three patients have recovered.Epidemiological and entomological field investigations by French authorities are still ongoing to determine the possible route(s) of transmission for these cases, prevent further spread and detect possible associated cases.It is probable that the three cases resulted from vector-borne transmission of ZIKV in this neighborhood in late July/early August. This is probably the first episode of ZIKV local vector-borne transmission detected in metropolitan France and in Europe.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "Local health authorities have implemented vector control activities, including mosquito detection, in the neighborhood of the cases.Epidemiological investigations have been implemented to identify additional cases in the area. Hospitals and healthcare professionals within the area and the department were informed about diagnosis and detection of ZIKV and notification of suspect cases. Tailored information has been provided to health professionals in charge of pregnant women living or having stayed in the neighborhood of the cases.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "The overall risk for disease spread at national level is very low given that the primary vector for ZIKV transmission\u00a0Aedes aegypti\u00a0is not established in France. A less competent but potential vector for spread,\u00a0Aedes albopictus, is established; however, the colder temperatures of the upcoming winter season will be progressively less suitable for vector activities to support Zika virus (ZIKV) transmission.There was no evidence in favor of sexual and organ/tissue transmission in all three cases and there is no history of travel outside metropolitan France. This suggests that the three cases were likely the result of vector-borne transmission of ZIKV locally.To date, there is no evidence of further spread beyond these three cases. However, French authorities are conducting further epidemiological investigations to assess the full extent of this possible viral circulation in the area. As 50-80% of ZIKV cases are known to be asymptomatic, it is possible that infection of the known cases originated from asymptomatic infected people through mosquito bites.At the regional level and global level, the aggregate risk for disease spread is considered very low.",
        "WHO Advice": "Protection against mosquito bites during the day and early evening is a key measure to prevent Zika virus infection. Special attention should be given to prevention of mosquito bites among pregnant women, women of reproductive age, and young children.Personal protective measures include wearing clothing (preferably light-colored) that covers as much of the body as possible; using physical barriers such as window screens and closed doors and windows; and applying insect repellent to skin or clothing that contains DEET, IR3535 or icaridin according to the product label instructions.Aedes\u00a0mosquitoes breed in small collections of water around homes, schools, and work sites. It is important to eliminate these mosquitoes breeding sites by: covering water storage containers, removing standing water in flower pots, and cleaning up trash and used tires. Community initiatives are essential to support local government and public health programs. Clean- up campaigns initiated at the community level are encouraged to get rid of all solid waste in back yards in and around houses and vacant plots. Health authorities may also advise use of larvicides and insecticides to reduce mosquito populations and disease spread.ZIKV can be transmitted through sexual intercourse. This is of particular concern due to an association between ZIKV infection and adverse pregnancy and fetal outcomes. For regions with active transmission of ZIKV, all sexually active men and women and in particular infected people and their sexual partners, should be counselled about how to protect themselves from Zika infection and offered a full range of contraceptive methods to make an informed choice about pregnancy risks and safer sex.Currently there is no vaccine available to prevent ZIKV infection, and no specific treatment for ZIKV infection or its associated diseases.WHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions with the affected country regarding this event.",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "The ongoing Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the North Kivu and Ituri provinces saw a stabilization in the number of new cases this past week, with 19 confirmed cases reported in the past week (23\u201329 October), essentially equivalent to the 20 confirmed cases the week before. The majority (63%) of newly confirmed cases link back to chains of transmission in Biakato Mine Health Area, Mandima Health Zone, including a further three cases detected outside of Mandima in individuals who recently travelled from Biakato.Onward local transmission has been observed in a limited number of towns and villages within family/social networks or health centers where cases visited prior to their detection and admission to treatment. In Mabalako, seven new cases were reported, of which two were linked to Biakato, two reported local family contact, and two were contacts within local health facilities, suggesting possible nosocomial exposure; investigations are ongoing for the remaining case. In Mambasa Health Zone, one additional case was reported, linked to a large cluster of cases. In Butembo, after over 21 days with no cases, two were reported this week. Both were residents of Kalunguta Health Zone where they were likely exposed. Thus far, there is no evidence of onward transmission in Butembo; nonetheless, these events demonstrate the high risks of reintroduction and resurgence in previously cleared health zones.During the past 21 days (from 9 \u2013 29 October), 59 confirmed cases were reported from eight active health zones in North Kivu and Ituri provinces (Figure 2, Table 1) with the majority reported in three health zones: Mandima (49%,\u00a0n=29), Mabalako (20%,\u00a0n=12), and Mambasa (10%,\u00a0n=6). As of 29 October, a total of 3269 EVD cases were reported, including 3152 confirmed and 117 probable cases, of which 2182 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 67%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (n=1841) were female, 28% (n=926) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (n=163) were health workers.Figure 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by week of illness onset by health zone.

        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "The number of confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) remains relatively low this week, with 21 new confirmed cases reported in North Kivu and Ituri provinces during the epidemiological week of 14 \u2013 20 October. The observed fluctuation in case\nincidence (Figure 1) may be expected given the challenges faced by response teams in the prior weeks.Biakato Health Area in Mandima Health Zone reported almost half the number of new confirmed cases in the past week (52%,\u00a0n=11) and had links to the majority of cases (76%, n=16). The movement of 5 cases exposed in Biakato Mines Health Area,\nbut detected outside of the area, brings forth operational challenges for teams on the ground. Movement of cases while symptomatic not only increases the risk of spread of EVD to unaffected and previously cleared geographic areas, it also hinders\ntimely case investigations, contact tracing, and response measures implemented to limit the risk of transmission.The deployment of additional support to the Biakato Mines Health Area has led to improvements in response efforts in the past week. The proportion of confirmed cases listed as contacts has increased from 13% to 57%. Similarly, in the past week there has\nbeen an increase from 47% to 90% in confirmed cases with a known epidemiological link to a case. Nevertheless, both indicators are below the level we would aim to be at this stage. As case incidence declines, continued strengthening of community-based\nsurveillance and alerts from health facilities to rapidly detect flare-ups is a high priority for all areas.During the past 21 days (from 2 \u2013 22 October), 50 confirmed cases were reported from eight active health zones in North Kivu and Ituri provinces (Figure 2, Table 1) with the majority reported in three health zones: Mandima (52%,\u00a0n=26),\nMambasa (12%,\u00a0n=6), and Mabalako (10%,\u00a0n=5). The major metropolitan area of Butembo city, comprising Katwa and Butembo health zones, which reported almost 1000 cases to date, recently cleared 21 days without newly detected\ncases. While this milestone highlights advances in the response, movement of cases to previously cleared health zones can quickly result in resurgence. An example of this was the detection of cases in Mabalako, all linked to Biakato Mines, after not\nreporting a confirmed case for 33 days. To mitigate the risk of onward transmission, ensuring community access and full operational readiness in cleared health zones and strategic at-risk communities is essential.As of 22 October, a total of 3250 EVD cases were reported, including 3133 confirmed and 117 probable cases, of which 2174 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 67%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (n=1827) were female, 28% (n=921)\nwere children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (n=163) were health workers.On 18 October, the Director-General reconvened the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations. The Committee reviewed progress in the implementation of the Temporary Recommendations issued by the Director-General on 17 July 2019. Updates\non the outbreak were provided by representatives of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as well as the UN Ebola Emergency Response Coordinator and the WHO Secretariat. Updates on preparedness in the neighbouring countries were provided by the United\nRepublic of Tanzania, Republic of Uganda and the WHO Regional Office for Africa. It was the view of the Committee that this event still constitutes a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) under the IHR. The Committee provided this\nadvice to the Director-General, who issued\u00a0revised Temporary Recommendations under the IHR.Under\u00a0Pillar 1 of the current Strategic Response Plan,\nthe estimated funding requirement for all partners for the period July to December 2019 is US$ 287 million, including US$ 140 million for WHO. As of 21 October 2019, US$ 69.5 million has been received by WHO, with additional funds committed or pledged.\nFurther resources are needed to fully fund the response through to December 2019 and into Q1 2020.Under Pillar 5,\u00a0Regional Preparedness, the funding requirement for all partners is US$ 66 million,\nof which WHO requires US$ 21 million. As of 21 October 2019, WHO has received US$ 4.3 million. While some additional pledges are in the pipeline, increased funding for preparedness in neighbouring countries is urgently needed. WHO is appealing to\ndonors to provide generous support.

        "Date Reported": "22 October 2019",
        "Location": "Lebanon",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "Health authorities in Lebanon are responding to an outbreak of measles. From 1 November 2018 through 12 October 2019, a total of 1,171 cases have been reported, of which 675 (57.6%) were laboratory confirmed, 8 (0.7%) epidemiologically linked cases, and 488 (41.7%) were clinically diagnosed. No associated deaths have been reported as of now.Measles cases have been reported in all eight Lebanese governorates, with Aakar, Baalbek-El-Hermel, Bekaa North, and Mount Lebanon governorates most affected. Ninety percent of suspected measles cases were Lebanese nationals, while 10% were Syrians living in informal settlements and in residential areas. The cumulative incidence of measles among Lebanese was higher than that of Syrians (22.4 versus 11.1 per 100,000 population respectively).The most affected age group among the 1,123 cases with known age was children under the age of 5 years with 705 cases (63%), followed by cases of 5-9 years of age (271 cases; 24%), 10-14 (31 cases; 3%), 15-24 (19 cases; 2%), and people over 24 years of age represented 97 cases (9%). In addition, children below 5 years old have the highest cumulative incidence (124.6 per 100,000 population) followed by children in the age group of 5-9 years (41.4 per 100,000 population).The immunization strategy employed by the Lebanon public health sector includes both measles vaccine given at 9 months of age (introduced in 1987), and Measles Mumps Rubella (MMR) vaccine given to children as two doses at 12 and 18 months of age (MMR, introduced in 1996). The private sector implements MMR vaccination, at 12 months and 4-5 years of age.In Lebanon, between 2000 to 2018, the WHO-UNICEF coverage estimations for second dose of measles-containing-vaccine ranged from 15 -75 percent with a median coverage of 63 percent.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "The Ministry of Health (MoH) in Lebanon is coordinating the response activities, with the support of WHO and UNICEF. Public health response measures include:Epidemiological investigations, contact tracing and monitoring of close contacts;Sensitization of clinicians on measles surveillance, reporting, case investigation and management;Social mobilization and distribution of information, education and communication (IEC) materials;Measles assessment mission, conducted in May 2019, recommended a national measles campaign and support to the epidemiological surveillance unit;Localized accelerated immunization activities in areas of measles clusters;Planning of a national measles campaign targeting 1,170,000 children in the age group of 6 months to less than 10 years of age.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Based on the available information, the risk at the national level is considered to be high for the following reasons: nationwide case distribution and low vaccination coverage at national level with immunity gaps; the country host around one million displaced Syrians with limited access to healthcare; limited funding for supplementary immunization activities to improve measles vaccination coverage, and for the epidemiological surveillance unit to support surveillance activities and capacity building; and measles cases being reported throughout the country.The overall risk at regional level was assessed as moderate due to porous boundaries allowing free movement between Lebanon and Syria, the low vaccination coverage and recent measles outbreaks reported in neighboring countries. The overall risk at global level was assessed as low.",
        "WHO Advice": "Immunization is the only effective preventive measure against measles. Two doses of measles-containing-vaccine are recommended to ensure immunity.Measles is a highly contagious viral disease which affects susceptible individuals of all ages and remains one of the leading causes of death among young children globally, despite the availability of safe and effective measles-containing vaccines. It is transmitted via droplets from the nose, mouth, or throat of infected persons. Initial symptoms, which usually appear 10\u201312 days after infection, include high fever, usually accompanied by one or several of the following: runny nose, conjunctivitis, cough and tiny white spots on the inside of the mouth. Several days later, a rash develops, starting on the face and upper neck and gradually spreads downwards. A patient is infectious 4 days before the start of the rash to 4 days after the appearance of the rash. Most people recover within 2\u20133 weeks.While there is no specific antiviral treatment for measles, the provision of vitamin A is recommended by WHO for all children infected with measles, as it is associated with reduced mortality and severity of complications. In populations with high levels of malnutrition and a lack of adequate health care, up to 10% of measles cases result in death and in the most vulnerable groups deaths can reach up to 30%. Among malnourished children and people with greater susceptibility, measles can also cause serious complications, including blindness, encephalitis, severe diarrhea, ear infection, and pneumonia.In countries with low vaccination coverage, epidemics typically occur every two to three years and usually last between two and three months, although their duration varies according to population size, crowding, and the population\u2019s immunity status.WHO urges all Member States to do the following:Vaccinate to maintain high coverage (\u2265 95%) with two doses of measles-containing-vaccine, in every district;Vaccinate at-risk populations (without proof of vaccination or immunity against measles and rubella), such as healthcare workers, people working in tourism and transportation, and international travelers;Maintain a reserve of MCV for control of imported cases;Strengthen epidemiological surveillance for \u2018fever with rash cases\u2019 for timely detection of all suspected cases of measles in public and private healthcare facilities;Ensure that collected blood samples from suspect measles cases are received by laboratories within five days;Provide a rapid response to imported measles cases through the activation of rapid response teams to prevent the establishment or re-establishment of endemic transmission;Administer vitamin A supplementation to all children diagnosed with measles to reduce the complications and mortality (two doses of 50, 000 IU for a child less than 6 month of age, 1,00, 000 IU for children between 6 and12 months of age or 2, 00, 000 IU for children 12-59 months, immediately upon diagnosis and on the following day).",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "The number of confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) has been relatively low in recent weeks, with 15 new confirmed cases reported in North Kivu and Ituri provinces during the epidemiological week of 7 October through 13 October (Figure 1). These\nencouraging signs are offset by a marked increase in case incidence in Biakato Mine Health Area, Mandima Health Zone. During the past 21 days (from 25 September through 15 October), a total of 50 confirmed cases were reported from ten health zones\n(Table 1, Figure 2), of which two-thirds (62%,\u00a0n=31) were reported from or had transmission links to Biakato Mine Health Area.Issues with access and security are impacting case finding and investigations, contact tracing, safe and dignified burials, decontamination of affected residences, and vaccination rings in parts of Mandima Health Zone. This is reflected in the decline\nin the proportion of confirmed cases listed as contacts (from 57% to 13%) and increase in the proportion of cases dying outside of Ebola Treatment Centres or Transit Centres (from 14% to 27%) this past week. This is further demonstrated by the relatively\nlow numbers of alerts reported in the two areas over the past 42 days, with 32% less than the expected number.A recent qualitative investigation in these health zones indicated that there is poor understanding among the population and local health workers of the transmission mechanism and symptoms of the disease, compounded with an environment of mistrust surrounding\nthe origin of the disease, and reason for vaccination. This may impact the reporting of cases and engagement with response activities. Less than half of the respondents indicated that they would call a hotline if a member of their community was suspected\nof having Ebola, and almost half reported that they would encourage a family member to go to a Treatment/Transit Centre if they were suspected of having Ebola. Furthermore, less than half of individuals interviewed understood the functions of different\ninterventions in the response, and less than 5% were involved in the response. This investigation highlights the importance of engaging communities in response activities in the upcoming weeks.As of 15 October, a total of 3227 EVD cases were reported, including 3113 confirmed and 114 probable cases, of which 2154 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 67%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (n=1811) were female, 28% (n=918)\nwere children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (n=162) were health workers.The Director-General will reconvene the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (IHR), as three months have passed since the declaration of the public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) on 17 July. The committee will\nreview progress in the implementation of the Temporary Recommendations issued by the Director-General on 17 July, discuss whether the event still constitutes a PHEIC, and if yes, advise for new or updated Temporary Recommendations under the IHR. The\ncurrent recommendations are available\u00a0here\u00a0as will be the upcoming statement.Under\u00a0Pillar 1 of the current Strategic Response Plan,\nthe estimated funding requirement for all partners for the period July to December 2019 is US$ 287 million, including US$ 140 million for WHO.

One hundred seventy two cases were female (62%), and 238 (93.1%) were over 5 years of age.As of 2 October, 28 out of 42 (67%) samples tested from affected States were confirmed by culture as\u00a0Vibrio cholerae\u00a0O1 Ogawa in the National Public Health Laboratory.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "The following public health response measures have been implemented:With the support of WHO, the Federal Ministry of Health (FMoH) activated the national Cholera Task Force on 10 September;WHO has deployed a technical team to assist FMoH with coordination of response and development of response strategy on the ground;Surveillance and reporting system have been strengthened by the distribution of case definitions and case investigation forms, active case finding and maintaining the line list;Activation of 14 Cholera Treatment Centres by MoH, 4 in Blue Nile State and 10 in Sinnar State, and standardization of case management protocols;FMoH, WHO, and partners have provided cholera kits (enough to treat 200 people) with three additional kits (enough to treat 300 people) in the pipeline;WHO is supporting the water quality surveillance system, water sampling, and testing, and infection prevention & control activities;State Ministry of Health in Blue Nile State, with the support of partners, is implementing the water chlorination activities and health promotion in the affected areas;WHO,with the support of Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI), has launched an Oral Cholera Vaccine (OCV) campaign with an aim to target 1.6 million people in Senner and Blue Nile State. Doses of OCV have been released from the WHO global stockpile.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Sudan is facing a continuous surge of suspected cholera cases since 2016. The current outbreak was reported following recent severe rainstorms and flooding in 15 out of 18 States. With the ongoing flooding and widespread damage to infrastructure, there is a concern that cases may further increase. Although Blue Nile State shares borders with Ethiopia and South Sudan, there is currently no evidence of cross-border spread of the outbreak. However,the risk of spread is of more concern in the areas situated down the river Nile (including Khartoum). The Government swiftly responded to the detection of cases and necessary control measures are being implemented by national authorities, with support from partners, to contain the outbreak.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO recommends proper and timely case management. Improving access to safe drinking water and sanitation infrastructure, as well as improving hygiene practices and food safety in affected communities are the most effective means of controlling cholera.Key public health communication messages should be provided to the population. Vaccination should be considered to complement the core prevention and control activities and help prevent the spread of the outbreak.WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions on Sudan based on the currently available information.",

        "Location": "Democratic Republic of the Congo",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "The number of reported cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) consistently declined in recent weeks, with 14 new confirmed cases reported in North Kivu and Ituri provinces during the epidemiological week of 30 September through 6 October (Figure 1). At peak\ntransmission in April 2019, there were 126 cases in the week. Although the decline in case incidence is encouraging, it must be interpreted with caution as the situation remains highly contingent upon the level of access and security.In mid-September, serious security incidents in Lwemba Health Area, Mandima Health Zone, stalled outbreak response activities for more than two weeks. To improve confidence and community engagement in response activities, an open forum for discussion\nand reconciliation was held in Lwemba with partners and civil society last week. Response activities have since resumed but remain limited. Improved access may result in enhanced case finding and contact tracing therefore could result in an increase\nin the number of reported cases and contacts in the area.There is a shift in hot spots from urban settings to more rural, hard-to-reach communities, across a more concentrated geographical area. During the past 21 days (from 18 September through 8 October), a total of 59 confirmed cases were reported from ten\nhealth zones (Table 1, Figure 2), with almost four out of five confirmed cases from four health zones: Mandima (31%,\u00a0n=18), Mambasa (29%,\u00a0n=17), Komanda (10%,\u00a0n=6), Oicha (8%,\u00a0n=5). This brings\nadditional challenges to the response, including an extremely volatile security situation, difficulty accessing some remote areas, relatively poorer Ebola awareness and delays to engaging with the community leading to mistrust and misunderstandings,\nand potential under-reporting of cases, especially around some mining sites. The occurrence of transmission along a major road in from Komanda and Mambasa also poses greater risk of spread westward to other major cities in the country (such as to\nKisangani).As of 8 October, a total of 3207 EVD cases were reported, including 3093 confirmed and 114 probable cases, of which 2144 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 67%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 59% (n=1797) were female, 31% (n=909)\nwere children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (n=162) were health workers.As of 4 October, 1000 people have survived EVD in this outbreak. Since November 2018, the Ministry of Health and the Institute of Biomedical Research laboratory, with support from WHO, have undertaken a programme to aid in the reintegration of survivors\ninto the community. The programme provides to EVD survivors monthly clinical, biological and psychological follow-up for a year after their discharge from the treatment center. Currently there are three operational clinics located in Beni, Butembo\nand Mangina.Under\u00a0Pillar 1 of the current Strategic Response Plan,\nthe estimated funding requirement for all partners for the period July to December 2019 is US$ 287 million, including US$ 120-140 million for WHO. As of 10 October, US$ 60.4 million have been received by WHO, with additional funds committed or pledged.\nFurther resources are needed to fund the response through to December 2019 and into the first quarter of 2020.Under Pillar 5,\u00a0Regional Preparedness, the funding requirement for all partners is US$ 66 million,\nof which WHO requires US$ 21 million. As of 8 October, WHO has received US$ 1.6 million. Whilst some additional pledges are in the pipeline, increased funding for preparedness in neighboring countries is urgently needed. WHO is appealing to donors\nto provide generous support. A summary of funding received by WHO since the start of this outbreak can be found\u00a0here.Figure 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by week of illness onset by health zone.

        "WHO Risk Assessment": "WHO continuously monitors changes to the epidemiological situation and context of the outbreak to ensure that support to the response is adapted to the evolving circumstances. The last assessment, carried out on 8 October 2019, concluded that the national and regional risk levels remain very high, while global risk levels remain low.Substantial progress has been made in the response over the past month with the number of new confirmed cases on a stable decline. With ongoing transmission shifting from major metropolitan hotspots to rural health zones, vigilance is required as these areas can be difficult to access and face security challenges. Response strategies must continue to be adapted to the local context and capacities for operational readiness and preparedness should be enhanced and sustained in non-outbreak affected areas including major transit routes.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for travellers to/from the affected countries. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

        "Date Reported": "8 October 2019",
        "Location": "Nigeria",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 29 August 2019, a suspected yellow fever case was reported from Kano state with a travel history to Yankari game reserve, Alkaleri Local Government Area (LGA), Bauchi state, Nigeria.From 29 August through 22 September 2019, Nigeria reported an outbreak of yellow fever with an epi-centre in the Yankari game reserve of Alkaleri LGA, Bauchi state. According to Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), 231 suspected cases have been reported in four states including Bauchi (110), Borno (109), Gombe (10), and Kano (2), of which there have been 13 presumptive positive by IgM testing and 24 cases positive by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at national laboratories. Of 24 cases confirmed by RT-PCR (20 cases in Bauchi, three in Gombe and one in Kano state), six deaths were reported, all from Alkaleri LGA, Bauchi state, resulting in a case fatality ratio of 25% among the confirmed cases. The vaccination history for the 231 suspected yellow fever cases is not known, and the results of follow-up testing from regional reference laboratory Institute Pasteur Dakar (IPD) are not yet available.This is the first time that cases have been reported in relation to this area since the outbreak started in Nigeria in September 2017. This outbreak is unique in the broad geographic distribution of cases, most with linkage through travel, work or residence in, or close to, the Yankari game reserve, which is an ecological zone highly prone to yellow fever virus circulation (vectors, reservoir).Epidemiological summary for Nigeria from 1 January through 31 August 2019 (not including the cases in Bauchi)Since 15 September 2017, when the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) officially notified a confirmed case of yellow fever in Kwara state to WHO as per the International Health Regulations (2005), the country has been responding to successive yellow fever outbreaks over a wide geographic area.From 1 January to 31 August 2019, a total of 2,254 suspected yellow fever cases have been reported in 535 LGA\u2019s. All states including Federal Capital Territory (FCT) have reported at least one suspected case of yellow fever. Samples have been collected for 2,197 suspected cases, and according to Nigerian laboratories 74 tests were presumptive positive and 29 inconclusive for yellow fever. A total of 103 (74 presumptive positive and 29 inconclusive) samples were sent to yellow fever reference laboratory Institute Pasteur in Dakar (IPD) for confirmatory testing, of which 29 tested positive. Eight additional cases were confirmed by the Nigerian laboratories including National Reference Laboratory (7), Lagos University Teaching Hospital (1). These 37 confirmed cases were from the states of Edo (13), Ebonyi (8), Ondo (4), Katsina, (3), Kebbi (2), Anambra (1), Cross River (1), Imo (1), Osun (1), Oyo (1), Kano (1), and Sokoto (1). Forty-four (44) deaths have been recorded from the states of Katsina (14), Edo (1), Adamawa (1) and Ebonyi (28) with an overall CFR of 2% among suspected cases.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "The outbreak response activities are being coordinated by a multi-agency national yellow fever emergency operation centre (EOC) hosted at NCDC. On 5 September 2019, a national Incident Management System (IMS) was activated to coordinate the response activities. A national rapid response team (RRT), including NCDC and National Primary Health Care development Agency (NPHCDA), have been deployed to Bauchi and other affected states to support outbreak response activities such as case finding, case management and risk communication. The state, with the support of partners, has successfully conducted a reactive yellow fever vaccination campaign in Alkaleri LGA, vaccinating 407,708 people and is now planning to conduct a similar campaign in contiguous LGAs across the affected states, including submission of an International Coordination Group (ICG) request for reactive vaccination.Routine yellow fever vaccination was introduced to Nigeria\u2019s Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) in 2004, but the overall population immunity in areas affected by the current outbreak remains below recognized herd immunity thresholds.A four-year (2018-2021) national yellow fever Preventive Mass Vaccination Campaign (PMVC) plan, supported by the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) and partners, is currently being implemented to cover all states in the country. By 2025, it is anticipated that all states in Nigeria will have conducted PMVC activities to protect at-risk populations against yellow fever.This year\u2019s phased preventive campaigns will target the following states, Anambra, Ekiti, Katsina, and Rivers, with specialized activities in Borno. Bauchi has not yet been covered by the phased PMVCs, and the states planned for the next phase are undergoing through a review process to consider the evolving epidemiology.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Yellow fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes and has the potential to spread rapidly and cause serious public health impact. There is no specific treatment, although the disease is preventable using a single dose of yellow fever vaccine, which provides immunity for life. Supportive care is required to treat dehydration, respiratory failure, and fever; and antibiotics are recommended to treat associated bacterial infections.The recent confirmation by the national reference laboratory of the yellow fever outbreak in Bauchi states linked with cases in three other states including Borno, Kano and Gombe represents a concerning situation in Nigeria.Given the scale of the outbreak in Bauchi and three other states, the national risk is assessed as high due to the potential for ongoing local transmission and amplification. Factors considered include the low vaccination coverage; probability of the presence of competent vectors including\u00a0Aedes\u00a0species; the potential spread to new LGAs, and the link of the outbreak to the game reserve in Alkaleri LGA, the most popular tourist destination in the country.There is currently a moderate risk at regional level due to the possible movement of the individuals of affected states to adjacent areas and neighbouring countries. The current overall risk is low at the global level.Nigeria is facing several concurrent public health emergencies, including circulating Vaccine Derived Polio Virus (cVDPV), measles, Lassa fever, and cholera outbreaks, and a humanitarian crisis in the northeast of the country. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and will reassess the evolution of risks based on the latest available information.",
        "WHO Advice": "Nigeria is a high priority country for the Eliminate Yellow Fever Epidemic (EYE) strategy. Vaccination is the primary intervention for prevention and control of yellow fever. The early detection and investigation of yellow fever cases through strong surveillance is key to control the risk of yellow fever outbreaks. Prevention of mosquito bites (repellents, wearing long clothes) is an additional measure that limits the risk of yellow fever transmission. In urban centres, targeted vector control measures are also helpful to interrupt transmission. WHO and partners will continue to support local authorities to implement these interventions to control the current outbreak.WHO recommends vaccination against yellow fever for all international travelers more than nine months of age going to Nigeria, as there is evidence of persistent or periodic yellow fever virus transmission. Nigeria also requires a yellow fever vaccination certificate for travelers older than one year of age arriving from countries with risk of yellow fever transmission.Yellow fever vaccines approved by WHO are safe, highly effective and provide life-long protection against infection. In the context of international travel,\u00a0the amendment to Annex 7\u00a0of the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) changes the period of validity of the related international certificate of vaccination against yellow fever, and the protection provided by vaccination against yellow fever infection from ten (10) years to the life of the person (traveler) vaccinated. Accordingly, as of 11 July 2016, for both existing or new certificates, revaccination or a booster dose of yellow fever vaccine cannot be required of international travelers as a condition of entry into a State Party, regardless of the date their international certificate of vaccination was initially issued.On 1st July 2019, WHO updated the areas at-risk of yellow fever transmission and the corresponding recommendations for vaccination of international travelers. The list of countries at-risk, and revised recommendations for vaccination against yellow fever are available on the WHO website:\u00a0International travel and health (ITH).WHO encourages its Member States to take all actions necessary to keep travelers well informed of risks and of preventive measures, including vaccination. Travelers should also be made aware of yellow fever signs and symptoms and instructed to seek rapid medical advice should they develop signs of illness. Travelers returning to Nigeria who may be infected with possible high levels of the virus in the blood may pose a risk for the establishment of local cycles of yellow fever transmission in areas where the competent vector is present.WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel or trade to Nigeria on the basis of the information available on this outbreak.",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo continues this week with 20 new confirmed cases reported in North Kivu and Ituri provinces from 25 September to 1 October 2019, versus 29 in the previous week. This decrease in the number of cases should be interpreted with caution, as operational and security challenges in certain health zones make it difficult to undertake case detection and response functions. With over half (55%) of cases in the past week coming from Mambasa and Mandima Health Zones, there is a clear shift in the hot spots of the outbreak from high density, urban settings, such as Butembo, Katwa, and Beni, to more rural areas with a lower population density. This results in a change in the transmission dynamics, with more community-based transmission and less possible transmission in healthcare facilities. Conversely, this may introduce new issues in terms of accessibility and logistical challenges to reach affected villages, especially as we enter the rainy season.In Mambasa Health Zone, delays in raising EVD awareness and involving the community and civil society in the response have led to community mistrust. To strengthen the participation of local communities in the response, WHO is working with the community, civil society, and partners in Mambasa Health Zone to engage women\u2019s groups and enhance community-based surveillance. While in Lwemba, within Mandima Health Zone, poor EVD awareness compounded with armed conflict has led to heightened tensions between local communities and Ebola response teams. This has resulted in difficulties in investigating community deaths. Therefore, it is likely that the number of cases and community deaths in this area is under reported.During the past 21 days (from 11 September through 1 October 2019), a total of 106 confirmed cases were reported from 13 health zones (Table 1, Figure 2), with the majority of cases from Mandima (26%,\u00a0n=27), Mambasa (25%,\u00a0n=26), Kalunguta (15%,\u00a0n=16), and Komanda (12%,\u00a0n=13) health zones.As of 1 October, a total of 3197 EVD cases were reported, including 3083 confirmed and 114 probable cases, of which 2136 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 67%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (1790) were female, 28% (906) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (161) were health workers.Under\u00a0Pillar 1 of the current Strategic Response Plan, the estimated funding requirement for all partners for the period July to December 2019 is US$ 287 million, including US$ 120-140 million for WHO. As of 2 Oct 2019, to US$ 61 million have been received by WHO, with further funds committed or pledged. Further resources are needed to fund the response through to December 2019 as well as into Q1 2020. WHO is appealing to donors to provide generous support.

The lack of response activities for a full two weeks in Mandima Health Zone has resulted in contacts of EVD cases being lost to follow-up and possible under-reporting of EVD cases. WHO is working with the community, civil society, and partners to strengthen engagement of local communities. As the outbreak progresses and fewer cases are reported resources can be diverted to scaling up areas which enhance detection and prevention of cases, particularly community engagement, case investigation and coordination between pillars.",

This decrease in the number of cases should be interpreted with caution, as operational and security challenges in certain health zones make it difficult to undertake case detection and response functions.There has been a recent increase in localized security or community-related incidents in several areas of operation. About a third of community incidents from August 2019, to date, occurred in Mambasa Health Zone. To strengthen the participation and engagement of local communities in this area, a WHO team of social scientists, community engagement, risk communication, and health promotion experts was set up to implement the Strategic Response Plan 4 (SRP4) approach and strategy together with La Commission Communication de Risque et Engagement Communautaire (CREC) sub-commission. The\u00a0recent major security incident\u00a0in Lwemba, within Mandima Health Zone, has halted response activities for the past nine days. This has limited contact tracing efforts, with 169 and 162 contacts lost to follow up in Lwemba and Mambasa, respectively.During the past 21 days (from 18 September through 24 September 2019), a total of 126 confirmed cases were reported from 13 health zones (Table 1, Figure 2), with the majority of cases from Mambasa (25%,\u00a0n=31), Mandima (18%,\u00a0n=23), and Kalunguta (16%,\u00a0n=20) health zones. Musienene Health Zone cleared 21 days without a new confirmed case of EVD.As of 24 September, a total of 3175 EVD cases were reported, including 3063 confirmed and 112 probable cases, of which 2122 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 67%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (1778) were female, 28% (902) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (161) were health workers.The Democratic Republic of the Congo health authorities have endorsed the use of a second investigational Ebola vaccine with at-risk populations in areas that do not have active EVD transmission. Regular vaccination activities in EVD-affected areas will continue. The Merck/MSD vaccine will continue to be provided to all people at high risk of Ebola infection including those who have been in contact with a person confirmed to have Ebola, all contacts of contacts, and others determined to be at high risk of contracting Ebola. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine will be deployed by a consortium, including the Ministry of Health, Democratic Republic of the Congo National Institute for Biomedical Research, Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), MSF Epicentre, United Kingdom Public Health Rapid Support Team, Wellcome Trust, and Janssen Vaccines & Prevention B.V. The Institut national de la sant\u00e9 et de la recherche m\u00e9dicale will coordinate the data safety and monitoring board.Under\u00a0Pillar 1 of the current Strategic Response Plan, the estimated funding requirement for all partners for the period July to December 2019 is US$ 287 million, including US$ 120-140 million for WHO. As of 26 September 2019, close to US$ 60 million have been received by WHO, with further funds committed or pledged. Currently available funds will close the financing gap just up until the end of October 2019. Further resources are needed to fund the response through to December 2019. WHO is appealing to donors to provide generous support.

        "WHO Risk Assessment": "WHO continuously monitors changes to the epidemiological situation and context of the outbreak to ensure that support to the response is adapted to the evolving circumstances. The last assessment, carried out on 5 August 2019, concluded that the national and regional risk levels remain very high, while global risk levels remain low.The recent fluctuations in case numbers per week must be interpreted with caution, as case reporting is dependent upon the level of security in the response areas. After more than a week with no response operations in Lwemba Health Area, within Mandima Health Zone, an increase in the number of reported cases is expected in the coming weeks as response activities resume.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for travellers to/from the affected countries. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

        "Date Reported": "26 September 2019",
        "Location": "Nigeria",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 16 July 2019, the Ebonyi State Ministry of Health received information about suspected yellow fever cases in Ndingele ward, Izzi Local Government Area (LGA), Nigeria. The cases had symptoms of fever and jaundice, reported with onset since May 2019. As of 30 August 2019, a total of 84 suspected yellow fever cases, including 26 deaths (case fatality ratio: 31 %), have been reported across nine LGAs within Ebonyi State. Of the suspected yellow fever cases, fifty-five per cent (46/84) are male. The most affected age group is 0-9 years (28 cases, 33%), followed by age groups 20-29 years and above 30 years each with 20 cases (24%). The 10-19 year age group has the least number of cases (16 cases, 19%). Seventy-nine per cent of suspected cases (66/84), including seven confirmed cases positive by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) are reported from Izzi LGA which is located in the north-eastern part of the State, bordered with Cross River State in the east, and Benue State in the north. One case has been confirmed in an international worker involved in the extractive industry in Izzi LGA, and residing in adjacent Abakiliki LGA (an urban centre in the State).The assessment conducted by the LGA rapid response team (RRT) and national agencies found low vaccination coverage and poor routine immunization documentation. Community surveys were conducted and yellow fever vaccination coverage was estimated to be 56% (64% for children aged less than 5 years and 48% for those older than 5 years of age). Though Nigeria introduced routine vaccination for yellow fever into the immunization schedule in 2004, most adults remain susceptible and overall population immunity is low. Although no entomological studies were conducted at the time, the geography and vegetation of the affected state is compatible with the presence of the Aedes mosquitoes, as illustrated by the transmission patterns.Since September 2017, when the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) informed WHO of a confirmed case of yellow fever in Kwara State, Nigeria has been responding to successive yellow fever outbreaks over a wide geographic area. Following the country\u2019s official notification to WHO (via the International Health Regulations, 2005) on 15 September 2017 of the resurgence in yellow fever outbreaks, suspect cases have been reported from all States and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), and outbreak responses to protect over 10 million people have occurred in select areas in 13 States. Efforts to strengthen surveillance are ongoing.From 1 January through 31 July 2019, over 2,000 suspected yellow fever cases have been reported in 506 LGAs from all 36 States including the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) of Nigeria.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "The response to the ongoing outbreak is being coordinated by the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) at the national level through a multi-agency, multi-partner Incident Management System (IMS). The public health emergency operations centre (PHEOC) located at the Ebonyi State Ministry of Health has been activated to monitor the outbreak. Active case finding, case management, risk communication and community engagement have been implemented in affected LGAs. An International Coordination Group (ICG) request for reactive vaccination in the affected area has been approved covering three LGAs in Ebonyi, two LGAs in Benue State and one LGA in Cross River State targeting a population of about 1.64 million people aged 9 months to 44 years in Ebonyi and Benue States, and aged 1-6 years in Yala LGA of Cross River State.Routine yellow fever vaccination was introduced to Nigeria\u2019s Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) in 2004, but the overall population immunity in areas affected by the current outbreak remains below recognized herd immunity thresholds.A four-year (2018-2021) national yellow fever Preventive Mass Vaccination Campaign (PMVC) plan supported by GAVI and partners is currently being implemented. By 2024, it is anticipated that all the States in Nigeria will have undergone campaign activities to protect at-risk populations against yellow fever.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Yellow fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes and has the potential to spread rapidly and cause serious public health impact. There is no specific treatment, although the disease is preventable using a single dose of yellow fever vaccine, which provides immunity for life. Supportive care is required to treat dehydration, respiratory failure, and fever; and antibiotics are recommended to treat associated bacterial infections.The recent confirmation by the national and regional reference laboratories of the Yellow fever cases in Ebonyi State, with the probable epicentre in Izzi LGA, represents a concerning situation in Nigeria.Given the rapid evolution of the situation in Ebonyi State, the national risk is assessed as high due to the high CFR (36%) and the potential for ongoing local transmission and amplification. Factors considered include the low vaccination coverage; probability of the presence of competent vectors including Aedes species; the proximity of a yellow fever case to Abakiliki LGA (an urban centre in the State); and the potential spread to new LGAs.There is currently a moderate risk at regional level due to the possible movement of the individuals of affected States to adjacent areas and neighbouring countries, particularly if there is arrival of unvaccinated visitors to the State. There is risk to national and international workers in high-risk extractive industries like open pit mining and forestry, underscoring the importance of ensuring all international travelers and workers are vaccinated according to International Health Regulations (IHR) recommendations as emphasized in the Eliminate Yellow Fever Epidemics (EYE) strategy. The current overall risk is considered to be low at the global level.Nigeria is facing several concurrent public health emergencies, including circulating Vaccine Derived Polio Virus (cVDPV), measles, cholera and Lassa fever outbreaks and a humanitarian crisis in the north-east of the country.",
        "WHO Advice": "Nigeria is a high priority country for the EYE strategy. Vaccination is the primary intervention for prevention and control of yellow fever. In urban centres, targeted vector control measures are also helpful to interrupt transmission. WHO and partners will continue to support national & state authorities to implement these interventions to control the current outbreak.WHO recommends vaccination against yellow fever for all international travelers more than nine months of age going to Nigeria, as there is evidence of persistent or periodic yellow fever virus transmission. This is of particular importance to temporary or international workers engaged in extractive industries. Nigeria also requires a yellow fever vaccination certificate for all arriving travelers over one year of age.Yellow fever vaccines recommended by WHO are safe, highly effective and provide life-long protection against infection. In accordance with the IHR (2005), Third edition, the validity of the international certificate of vaccination against yellow fever extends to the life of the person vaccinated with a WHO approved vaccine. A booster dose of approved yellow fever vaccine cannot be required of international travelers as a condition of entry.WHO encourages its Member States to take all actions necessary to keep travelers well informed of risks and preventive measures including vaccination. Travelers should also be made aware of yellow fever signs and symptoms and instructed to seek rapid medical advice should they develop signs of illness. Travelers returning to Nigeria who may be infected with possible high levels of the virus in the blood may pose a risk for the establishment of local cycles of yellow fever transmission in areas where a competent vector is present.WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel or trade to Nigeria on the basis of the information available on this outbreak.",

        "Date Reported": "24 September 2019",
        "Location": "Philippines",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 19 September 2019, the Philippines declared an outbreak of polio. Two cases have been reported to date, both caused by vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (VDPV2). Environmental samples taken from sewage in Manila on 13 August and a waterway in Davao on 22 August have also tested positive for VDPV2.The first case was confirmed on 14 September following testing by the National Polio Laboratory at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine, the Japan National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The case-patient is a 3-year-old girl from Lanao del Sur in the southern Philippines. The virus isolated is genetically linked to VDPV2 previously isolated from environmental samples in Manila and Davao. This indicates that the virus is circulating.The second case was confirmed on 19 September and is a 5-year-old boy from Laguna Province, approximately 100 km south-east of Metro Manila. Investigations and further characterization of the virus are ongoing.In addition, VDPV1 has also been isolated from environmental samples collected on 1 July, 22 July, 13 August, and 27 August from Manila.Vaccine-derived polioviruses are rarely occurring forms of the poliovirus that have genetically changed from the attenuated (weakened) virus contained in oral polio vaccine. They only occur when the vaccine virus is allowed to pass from person to person for a long time, which can only happen in places with limited immunization coverage and inadequate sanitation and hygiene. Over time, as it is passed between unimmunized people, it can regain the ability to cause disease. When the population is fully immunized with both oral polio vaccine and inactivated polio vaccine, this kind of transmission cannot take place. The gut immunity in people immunized with oral polio vaccine stops the virus from being passed on. Full immunization therefore protects against both vaccine-derived and wild polio viruses.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "Acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) and environmental surveillance are being enhanced to detect poliovirus.Field investigation is currently underway in Lanao del Sur to define the geographic scope of the circulation of the virus and inform planning for outbreak response including mass immunization campaigns.The Department of Health (DOH) reinforced its recommendation that all children should be vaccinated according to the routine immunization schedule.WHO and other partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) are supporting the Department of Health and local health authorities in their detailed investigations and supporting efforts to enhance surveillance, strengthen routine immunization, communicate risk to the public and implement outbreak response in line with internationally agreed polio outbreak response guidelines.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "WHO currently assesses the risk of international spread from the Philippines to be low. However, the risk of further spread within the Philippines is high due to limited population immunity (coverage of bivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV) and inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) was at 66% and 41% respectively in 2018) and suboptimal AFP surveillance.",
        "WHO Advice": "It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contact with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for AFP cases in order to detect virus importation and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage to minimize the consequences of any possible polio virus introduction or transmission.WHO recommends that all travellers and residents in polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio.As per the advice of an\u00a0Emergency Committee convened under the International Health Regulations (2005), the international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Countries affected by poliovirus transmission are subject to\u00a0Temporary Recommendations. To comply with the Temporary Recommendations issued under the PHEIC, any country infected by poliovirus should declare the outbreak as a national public health emergency.",

        "Date Reported": "19 September 2019",
        "Location": "Democratic Republic of the Congo",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "The intensity of the Ebola virus disease (EVD) transmission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo increased slightly from last week, with 57 new confirmed cases reported in North Kivu and Ituri provinces from 11-17 September 2019 versus 40 in the previous week. In the past week, localised, minor security incidents have impacted the response, including safe and dignified burials (SDB) and vaccination activities in Mambasa and Komanda Health Zones.In addition, there was a major security incident in Lwemba, within Mandima Health Zone, from 14-17 September. The event was a community response to the death of a local healthcare worker from EVD. Due to the violence that occurred during the incident, all activities have been suspended in the area until further notice. This has a serious impact on the response activities on the ground, and it could lead to gaps or delays in the reporting of new EVD cases in this hotspot area. Overall, these incidents underscore the need for continued and proactive engagement and sensitizing of local communities throughout areas with EVD transmission and high-risk areas that may not currently be affected.During the past 21 days (from 28 August through 17 September 2019), a total of 145 confirmed cases were reported from 14 health zones (Table 1, Figure 2), with the majority coming from the health zones of Kalunguta (21%,\u00a0n=30), Mambasa (21%,\u00a0n=30), and Mandima (19%,\u00a0n=27). With 14 cases in the last 21 days, there is a relative decrease in cases coming from Beni Health Zone. Masereka and Lolwa Health Zones cleared 21 days without a new confirmed case of EVD.As of 17 September, a total of 3145 EVD cases were reported, including 3034 confirmed and 111 probable cases, of which 2103 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 67%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (1760) were female, 29% (898) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (159) were health workers.Under\u00a0Pillar 1 of the current Strategic Response Plan, the estimated funding requirement for all partners for the period July to December 2019 is US$ 287 million, including US$ 120-140 million for WHO. As of 19 September 2019, close to US$ 60 million have been received by WHO, with further funds committed or pledged. Currently available funds will close the financing gap just up until the end of October 2019. Further resources are needed to fund the response through to December 2019. WHO is appealing to donors to provide generous support.

        "WHO Risk Assessment": "WHO continuously monitors changes to the epidemiological situation and context of the outbreak to ensure that support to the response is adapted to the evolving circumstances. The last assessment, carried out on 5 August 2019, concluded that the national and regional risk levels remain very high, while global risk levels remain low.Given the continued shift in outbreak hotspots, heterogeneity in transmission dynamics, and suspected delays in reporting due to security incidents, marginal variations in case numbers need to be interpreted with caution. These factors, coupled with high rates of population movement from outbreak-affected areas to other parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and across porous borders to neighbouring countries, increase the risk of geographical spread \u2013 both within the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to neighbouring countries. Conversely, substantive operational readiness and preparedness activities in a number of neighbouring countries have increased capacity to rapidly detect cases and mitigate local spread. These efforts must continue to be scaled-up and sustained.",

        "Date Reported": "16 September 2019",
        "Location": "Spain",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 16 August 2019, Regional Health Authorities in Andalusia, Spain, reported an outbreak of listeriosis, caused by the bacteria\u00a0Listeria monocytogenes\u00a0(L. monocytogenes), associated with the consumption of a chilled roasted pork meat product manufactured in Spain by Magrudis Company Limited and sold under the brand name \u201cLa Mech\u00e1\u201d. This outbreak was reported by Spanish Authorities to the World Health Organization, via the International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN), on 20 August 2019. On 23 August, a Food Safety Alert was issued by the Spanish Authorities, advising consumers to avoid any product sold under that brand and that a small amount of the implicated chilled roasted pork was also sold non-branded by another company.From 7 July through 13 September , a total of 222 confirmed cases linked to this outbreak have been reported in five regions of Spain: Andalusia (214), Aragon (4), Extremadura (2), Castilla y Leon (1), and Madrid (1). Fifty-seven per cent of cases are women including 38 pregnant women and 24% of cases are 65 years old or above (24 men and 25 women). Three deaths have been reported among elderly persons who were ill with listeriosis at the time of death. Reportedly, six women had miscarriages linked to this outbreak. On 23 August 2019, France, through the European Commission Early Warning and Response System (EWRS), notified a travel related case in a foreign citizen with travel history to Andalusia who had consumed the implicated product. Only three cases of listeriosis have been recorded with a date of consumption after 17 August, but all the three bought the product before the food alert was launched.Traceability investigations revealed that implicated products were only distributed in Spain, with the majority of product distributed in the region of Andalusia. The remaining product was distributed in three other autonomous regions in Spain. Through INFOSAN, it was confirmed that none of these products included in the extension had been distributed outside of Spain. This information has also been communicated through the European Commission\u2019s Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF).During further investigations at the manufacturing premises by authorities in Spain,\u00a0L. monocytogenes\u00a0was isolated in other products commercialized under the same brand. Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) of isolates of\u00a0L. monocytogenes\u00a0carried out at the Instituto de Salud Carlos III in Spain revealed that both, human and food strains share the same sequence.Source: SVEA, Regional Office for Health and Family Affairs. Regional Government of Andalusia.Further information on the outbreak and implicated products can be found on the\u00a0Spanish Food Safety and Nutrition Agency (AESAN)Information is also available on\u00a0Coordination Centre for Health Alerts and Emergencies, pertaining to the Ministry of Health in Spain.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "Following the notification of the Spanish Ministry of Health, Consumer Affairs and Social Welfare by the regional public health authorities in Andalusia on 16 August 2019, the authorities in Andalusia suspended production of the implicated chilled roasted pork at the implicated company and ordered the withdrawal of all batches from the market. The company voluntarily recalled all products manufactured since 01 May 2019 and tracing of the product was undertaken.As a result of the inspection, on 23 August 2019, the Public Health Alert in Andalusia was extended to other products manufactured by the company, Magrudis, and on 28 August 2019, this alert was extended to all products manufactured by Magrudis and all products produced by this company were recalled.Inspection of the manufacturer\u2019s facilities continues to identify the critical points in the chain of production where\u00a0L. monocytogenes\u00a0could have been introduced.Risk management advice has been communicated to the public, including advice on how to destroy or return the recalled products to the retailer.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Listeriosis can be readily treated with antibiotics if diagnosed early, however, the risk of severe invasive disease is high in specific susceptible groups including pregnant women, the elderly and immunocompromised individuals. When infection occurs during pregnancy, prompt administration of antibiotics prevents infection of the foetus and new-born babies with listeriosis may also be treated with antibiotics.Although the implicated products have been recalled, given the long incubation period of listeriosis (up to 70 days), the shelf life of the implicated products (three months), and the popularity of this brand of meat served in many restaurants, additional cases are expected in the coming weeks. Additionally, given the high number of tourists to Spain, and Andalusia, in particular during the summer months, international travellers may have been exposed while the product was in the market; although the risk for any international disease spread is low given that the products have been recalled and have not been exported outside of Spain.",
        "WHO Advice": "The control of\u00a0L. monocytogenes\u00a0is required at all stages in the food chain and an integrated approach is required to prevent the multiplication of this bacteria in the final food product.L. monocytogenes\u00a0in food are killed by pasteurization and cooking. In general, guidance on the prevention of listeriosis is similar to guidance used to help prevent other foodborne illnesses. This includes practising safe food handling and following the\u00a0WHO Five Keys to Safer Food\u00a0(1. Keep clean. 2. Separate raw and cooked. 3. Cook thoroughly. 4 Keep food at safe temperatures. 5. Use safe water and raw materials.)Persons in high risk groups, including pregnant women, patients undergoing treatment for cancer, AIDS and organ transplants, elderly people and infants, should take the following precautions:Avoid consuming dairy products made of unpasteurized milk; including soft cheeses made of raw milk, deli meats and ready-to-eat meat products such as sausages, hams, p\u00e2t\u00e9s and meat spreads, as well as cold-smoked seafood (such as smoked salmon);Cook leftover foods and ready-to-eat food until steaming hot before eating;Adhere to the shelf-life and storage temperature instructions written on labels of ready-to-eat foods to ensure that the bacteria potentially present in these foods does not multiply to dangerously high numbers. Cooking before eating is another very effective way to kill the bacteria.WHO Travel advicePlease see the\u00a0WHO recommendations for international travel and trade in relation to the Listeriosis outbreak in Spain\u00a0.In summary, to minimize the risk of infection, travellers in areas affected by listeriosis, should take similar precautions for the prevention of other types of foodborne diseases. People at higher risk with travel history to Andalusia since June 2019 who present listeriosis-like symptoms, should seek immediate medical attention and report their travel history to their medical doctor.WHO recommends against the application of any travel or trade restrictions in relation to this outbreak.",

        "Description of the Situation": "Ebola virus disease (EVD) transmission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo continued to ease this past week, with 40 new confirmed cases reported in North Kivu and Ituri provinces; this is the lowest weekly incidence since March 2019. While these\nsigns are promising, it remains too soon to tell if this trend will persist. Emerging hotspots continue to pose challenges in terms of accessibility, insecurity, and violence. Surveillance indicators highlight that public health risks of further spread\nremain very high.During the past 21 days (from 21 August through 10 September 2019), a total of 157 confirmed cases were reported form 15 health zones (Table 1, Figure 2), with the majority coming from the health zones of Kalunguta (19%,\u00a0n=30), Beni (18%,\u00a0n=28),\nMambasa (16%,\u00a0n=25), and Mandima (13%,\u00a0n=20). Alimbongo, Oicha, and Pinga health zones recently passed 21 days without a new confirmed case of EVD.As of 10 September, a total of 3091 EVD cases were reported, including 2980 confirmed and 111 probable cases, of which 2074 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 67%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (1737) were female, 29% (886) were\nchildren aged less than 18 years, and 5% (157) were health workers.Under\u00a0Pillar 1 of the current Strategic Response Plan,\nthe estimated funding requirement for all partners for the period July to December 2019 is US$ 287 million, including US$ 120-140 million for WHO. As of 12 September 2019, US$ 54.9 million have been received by WHO, with further funds committed or\npledged. Currently available funds will close the financing gap up until the end of September 2019. Further resources are needed to fund the response through to December 2019, and WHO is appealing to donors to provide generous support.

The last assessment, carried out on 5 August 2019, concluded that the national and regional risk levels remain very high, while global risk levels remain low.Although there are possible early signs of the outbreak easing, including the decrease in numbers of new confirmed cases in Beni and Mandima, these must be interpreted with caution and it is too soon to know if this is an indication of a decrease in transmission intensity of EVD. The high proportion of community deaths, relatively low proportion of new cases who were known contacts under surveillance, existence of transmission chains linked to possible nosocomial infection, persistent delays in detection and isolation of cases, and challenges in accessing some communities due to insecurity and pockets of community reticence are all factors increasing the likelihood of further chains of transmission in affected communities.The factors mentioned above, coupled with high rates of population movement from outbreak-affected areas to other parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and across porous borders to neighbouring countries, increase the risk of geographical spread \u2013 both within the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to neighbouring countries.

        "Description of the Situation": "The intensity of Ebola virus disease (EVD) transmission in the North Kivu, South Kivu, and Ituri provinces remains substantial, with 57 new cases reported since the last\u00a0EVD in the Democratic Republic of the Congo Disease Outbreak News Update on 29 August.\u00a0While\nhotspots such as Beni Health Zone show signs of easing, new hotspots are emerging elsewhere. During the past 21 days, from 14 August through 4 September 2019, a total of 186 confirmed cases were reported, with the majority coming from the health zones\nof Beni (17%,\u00a0n=31), Kalunguta (15%,\u00a0n=28), Mandima (13%,\u00a0n=24), and Mambasa (12%,\u00a0n=22). Given the limited access and insecurity in the emerging clusters within Kalunguta, Mandima, and Mambasa\nhealth zones, the response activities have been somewhat hindered.Likewise, sustained local transmission in Mutwanga and Kayna health zones, on the shores of Lake Edward and Ugandan border, pose added risks of regional spread. This risk was highlighted last week by the confirmation of a case on 29 August in a young\nchild who was exposed and developed symptoms in Mutwanga Health Zone before she was identified at the Mpondwe-Kasindi border point of entry (PoE) when travelling with her mother to seek medical care. The child was immediately transported to an Ebola\nTreatment Centre (ETC) in Bwera, Uganda, where she was provided with care but unfortunately died shortly after arrival. While a limited number of potential contacts are currently under surveillance, there have not been any further cases confirmed\nin Uganda to date.As of 4 September, a total of 3054 EVD cases were reported, including 2945 confirmed and 109 probable cases, of which 2052 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 67%). Cases have been reported from 29 health zones since the beginning of this outbreak,\nof which 17 health zones reported new cases in the last 21 days (Table 1, Figure 2). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 58% (1772) were female, 28% (865) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (156) were health workers.Under\u00a0Pillar 1 of the current Strategic Response Plan,\nthe estimated funding requirement for all partners for the period July to December 2019 is US$ 287 million, including US$ 120-140 million for WHO.

        "Description of the Situation": "The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu, South Kivu, and Ituri provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo continued this week with similar transmission intensity to the previous six weeks, with an average of 77 cases per week (Figure 1). In the past 21 days from 7 August through 27 August 2019, 66 health areas within 18 health zones reported new cases (Table 1, Figure 2). During this period, a total of 203 confirmed cases were reported, with the majority coming from the health zones of Beni (28%,\u00a0n=57), Mandima (11%,\u00a0n=22), and Kalunguta (11%,\u00a0n=22). In addition, Mambasa continues to show signs of an emerging hotspot, with 16 reported cases in the past 21 days. The response continues to address these hotspots through early case detection and thorough investigation, strong contact identification and follow up, and engagement with the local communities.Two additional cases have been reported in South Kivu\u2019s Mwenga Health Zone, bringing the total to six cases since 15 August. These individuals are family members of one of the recent cases. Although this indicates two generations of local transmission within Mwenga, the new cases are individuals who were under surveillance, and they were able to quickly receive care when they became ill.On 22 August, Nyiragongo Health Zone (which includes suburbs of Goma city) passed 21 days without additional confirmed cases detected, and all contacts completed the 21-day follow-up period. Surveillance and response activities within Goma city and surrounding areas will continue, as risks of further introduction of EVD from active areas remain high.As of 27 August, a total of 2997 EVD cases were reported, including 2892 confirmed and 105 probable cases, of which 1998 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 67%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 58% (1740) were female, and 28% (842) were children aged less than 18 years. To date, 156 health workers have been infected.Pillar 1 of the fourth Strategic Response Plan (SRP4) for the control of the EVD outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is available\u00a0on the WHO website. Pillar 1 covers the core public health response to the outbreak. The current estimated funding requirement for all partners for the period July to December 2019 is US$ 287 million, including US$ 120-140 million for WHO. As of 27 August, US$ 45.3 million have been received by WHO, with further funds committed or pledged. Current available funds will close the financing gap up until the end of September 2019.

        "Description of the Situation": "The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo continued this week with similar transmission intensity (Figure 1). While the last few weeks of the outbreak have been characterized by the geographic expansion of cases to new health zones, we continue to see high case numbers, sustained local transmission, and inter-health zone movement of cases both into and out of the hotspot areas of Beni, Mandima, and Butembo. In the past 21 days from 31 July through 20 August 2019, 69 health areas within 19 health zones reported new cases (Table 1, Figure 2). During this period, a total of 216 confirmed cases were reported, with the majority coming from the health zones of Beni (31%,\u00a0n=66), Mandima (18%,\u00a0n=38), and Butembo (8%,\u00a0n=18). High risks of transmission are also associated with an emerging cluster in the city of Mambasa, which has reported 14 cases in the past 21 days. The response continues to address these hotspots through early case detection and thorough investigation, strong contact identification and follow up, and engagement with the local communities.Two new health zones reported cases in the past week: Mwenga Health Zone in South Kivu and Pinga Health Zone in North Kivu. In Mwenga, four confirmed cases were reported after two individuals (mother and child) had contact with a confirmed case in Beni before travelling south. The father of the child was subsequently confirmed positive as was a co-patient in a community health facility where the first case initially sought care.In Pinga, one confirmed case has been reported with no apparent epidemiological links to other cases and no recent travel or visitors from outbreak affected areas. Pinga presents an added challenge to response teams in terms of remoteness, limited telecommunications, security risks, and resistance within the affected family and community.As of 20 August, a total of 2927 EVD cases were reported, including 2822 confirmed and 105 probable cases, of which 1961 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 67%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 58% (1697) were female, and 28% (830) were children aged less than 18 years. To date, 154 health workers have been infected.Eleven additional probable cases were validated last week, among these were cases who died in the community in Katwa, Kyondo, Vuhovi, and Mabalako health zones during March through June 2019 with epidemiological links to the outbreak; these cases could not be sampled for laboratory testing to confirm/exclude EVD.On 19 August 2019, a \u201cville morte\u201d protest took place in Beni, Butembo, and Oicha in response to recent attacks by armed groups on civilians. This resulted in a temporary suspension of Ebola response activities. Operations resumed on 20 August 2019 with increased caution, and further demonstrations are anticipated. The suspension of Ebola response activities often results in an increase of case numbers and spread of cases to new areas in the subsequent weeks.Figure 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by week of illness onset by health zone.

        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo continued this week with similar transmission intensity to recent weeks, with an average of 81 cases per week (range 68 to 91 cases per week) in the past six weeks (Figure 1). There are currently no confirmed cases of EVD outside of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.This week, initial data from a randomized clinical trial (RCT) of EVD therapeutics were announced. The data showed that two of the four treatments trialled were more effective in treating EVD. As a result, patients in the four Ebola treatment centres that participated in the RCT will now be randomized to receive the two better performing treatments. Patients in treatment centres not participating in the RCT will continue to be able to access those treatments under a compassionate use protocol. This change will help ensure that every treatment centre patient receives the best possible treatment with the greatest chance of survival, based on the most recent evidence.The data indicates that when people are willing and able to access care soon after the onset of symptoms, they have an increased chance of survival. Providing each patient with optimal supportive care, closely monitoring their progress, and addressing any other health issues has saved lives and will continue to be a top priority. More information is available in the following\u00a0update\u00a0and\u00a0press release.No new confirmed cases have been reported in Goma city since our last report, with a total of four confirmed cases reported from Goma (n=1) and Nyiragongo (n=3) health zones to date. Two cases, who were infected via direct contact with the case reported on 30 July, received treatment at an Ebola Treatment Centre in Goma city and were discharged on 13 August. A total of 203 contacts of the Nyiragongo cases remain under surveillance.In the 21 days from 24 July through 13 August 2019, 66 health areas within 17 health zones reported new cases (Table 1, Figure 2). During this period, a total of 228 confirmed cases were reported, with the majority coming from the health zones of Beni (42%,\u00a0n=96) and Mandima (20%,\u00a0n=46). A case was confirmed in Lolwa Health Zone, which is the first confirmed case in that health zone to date, bringing the total number of affected health zones over the course of the outbreak to 27. The case travelled from Mandima to Lolwa, where they became symptomatic. Currently, there is no evidence of local transmission of EVD in this health zone. Close identification and follow up of contacts is ongoing to minimize the chance of local transmission.New infections continue to be reported among personnel working in community health posts and other facilities. In the last 21 days, 11 new cases were reported among health workers from Beni (n=3), Mandima (n=2), and one each in Katwa, Mabalako, Mambasa, Masereka, Mutwanga, and Vuhovi. Cumulatively, 151 (5%) health workers have been infected to date.As of 13 August, a total of 2842 EVD cases were reported, including 2748 confirmed and 94 probable cases, of which 1905 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 67%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 57% (1608) were female, and 29% (815) were children aged less than 18 years.Pillar 1 of the fourth Strategic Response Plan (SRP4) for the control of the EVD outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is now available\u00a0on the WHO website. Other pillars of the plan and their funding needs are being finalized by response partners and will be progressively released.Pillar 1 covers the core public health response to the outbreak; the funding requirement for all partners to sustain the health response as outlined in this plan is 287 million US dollars, including 120-140 million US dollars for WHO. So far, 15.3 million US dollars have been received, with further funds pledged but not yet received. Despite recent announcements of new contributions, WHO\u2019s operations are impacted by a lack of cash flow. The funding shortfall is immediate and critical. A summary of funding received by WHO since the start of this outbreak can be found\u00a0here.Figure 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by week of illness onset by health zone.

The last assessment, carried out on 5 August 2019, concluded that the national and regional risk levels remain very high, while global risk levels remain low.Substantial rates of transmission continue within outbreak affected areas of North Kivu and Ituri provinces, with demonstrated extension to new high risk areas and across borders in recent months, although without sustained local transmission in these areas. The high proportion of community deaths, relatively low proportion of new cases who were known contacts under surveillance, existence of transmission chains linked to nosocomial infection, persistent delays in detection and isolation of cases, and challenges in accessing some communities due to insecurity and pockets of community reticence are all factors increasing the likelihood of further chains of transmission in affected communities.The factors mentioned above, coupled with high rates of population movement from outbreak-affected areas to other parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and across porous borders to neighbouring countries, increase the risk of geographical spread \u2013 both within the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to neighbouring countries. Conversely, substantive operational readiness and preparedness activities in a number of neighbouring countries have increased capacity to rapidly detect cases and mitigate local spread.

There are currently no confirmed cases of EVD outside of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.In the 21 days from 17 July through 6 August 2019, 65 health areas within 16 health zones reported new cases (Table 1, Figure 2). During this period, a total of 257 confirmed cases were reported, with the majority coming from the health zones of Beni (46%, n=119) and Mandima (23%, n=58). The majority of recent cases in Mandima Health Zone were reported from the northern health areas of Som\u00e9 (n=39) and Mayuano (n=8). Of the eight cases reported in Mambasa Health Zone in the past 21 days, the majority have epidemiological links to Som\u00e9 Health Area, with limited local transmission in Mambasa thus far.No new confirmed cases have been reported in Goma city since our last report, with a total of four confirmed cases reported from Goma (n=1) and Nyiragongo (n=3) health zones to date. Of the four cases, two have died and two are in an Ebola Treatment Centre(ETC). On 3 August, all 256 contacts related to the first confirmed case in Goma Health Zone (reported 14 July), finished their 21-day follow up period. A total of 232 contacts (including 114 high risk contacts) of the Nyiragongo cases remain under surveillance. Ongoing vaccination activities have reached the majority (98%) of eligible contacts, and 1314 contacts, contacts of contacts and frontline workers vaccinated to date.New infections continue to be reported among personnel working in community health posts and other facilities.

The report of confirmed cases and local transmission in Goma, capital of North Kivu with a population of over two million inhabitants, highlights the potential of spread within the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to neighbouring countries. Bolstered by months of preparedness, a sizable response, including exhaustive contact tracing and ring vaccination, was rapidly implemented upon detection of these cases with the aim of preventing tertiary spread or sustained local transmission in Goma city.The security situation over the past week increased in volatility, with the continued presence of non-state armed groups observed throughout operational areas. In Beni Health Zone, a number of recent attacks by suspected ADF elements that resulted in numerous civilian casualties led to a demonstration on 7 August 2019 in Beni/Mavivi to protest against the continued insecurity in the area. This was followed by larger demonstrations on 8 August in Beni due to an attack by ADF in Mbau on the Beni/Oicha axis that led to six civilian deaths, including a prominent civil society leader. EVD operations in the area have been temporarily suspended until the situation calms. The continuity of response activities is facilitated by the close monitoring of the operational environment and the corresponding implementation of appropriate security measures.The factors mentioned above, coupled with high rates of population movement from outbreak-affected areas to other parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and across porous borders to neighbouring countries, increase the risk of geographical spread \u2013 both within the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to neighbouring countries.

        "Description of the Situation": "The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo continued this week with similar transmission intensity to recent weeks, with an average of 85 cases per week (range 79 to 91 cases per week) in the past six weeks (Figure 1). There are currently no confirmed cases of EVD outside of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.On 30 July, a confirmed EVD case was reported in Nyiragongo Health Zone on the outskirts of Goma city. The case worked as a miner in Ituri Province and travelled down through several outbreak hotspots, where he likely acquired the disease. Currently, there is no indication that the case had links to the to the first case identified in Goma on 14 July (see the\u00a018 July Disease Outbreak News). Given that he was ill and in the community for several days before presenting to a health facility, secondary transmission to close contacts was anticipated. Two family members, a child and spouse, have subsequently tested positive and are receiving care in the Goma Ebola Treatment Centre (ETC). Other suspected cases among contacts are awaiting test results. Bolstered by months of preparedness, a sizable response, including exhaustive contact tracing and ring vaccination, was rapidly implemented upon detection of these cases with the aim of preventing tertiary spread or sustained local transmission in Goma city. Nonetheless, teams remain ready to rapidly respond to new cases. As of 1 August 2019, there are four confirmed case of EVD in Goma.In the 21 days from 11 July through 31 July 2019, 71 health areas within 18 health zones reported new cases, representing 11% of the 664 health areas within North Kivu and Ituri provinces (Table 1, Figure 2). During this period, a total of 260 confirmed cases were reported, with the majority coming from the health zones of Beni (52%, n=135) and Mandima (16%, n=41). Most (68%, n=28) of the cases reported in Mandima Health Zone came from Som\u00e9 Health Area, which has in turn seeded cases to the nearby city of Mambasa in recent weeks. The response in Som\u00e9 Health Area was challenging for several weeks, due to tension between local communities and Ebola response teams. However, the situation has improved, following dialogues with community leaders to understand the community\u2019s perspective and to define common ground for collaboration. Biena Health Zone recently cleared 21 days since their last reported case. However, hotspots continue to be the source of cases in other areas through the movement of suspected and confirmed cases and their contacts, and high risks remain for the virus to be reintroduced to these areas, requiring teams to remain fully resourced and vigilant.As of 31 July 2019, a total of 2713 EVD cases were reported, including 2619 confirmed and 94 probable cases, of which 1823 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 67%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (1527) were female, and 29% (773) were children aged less than 18 years. Cases continue to increase among health workers, with the cumulative number infected rising to 149 (5% of all confirmed and probable cases). 1 August 2019 marked one year since the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo declared the Ebola outbreak.\u00a0UN partners reaffirmed\u00a0our collective commitment to the people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and called for solidarity to end the outbreak.Figure 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by week of illness onset by health zone.

While the overall security situation in the last 21 days was generally calm and bore no significant impact on the response operations, it remained unstable and concerning, with repeated sightings and activities of non-state armed groups within the area of operations. Threats on response personnel and assets continued to be recorded, indicating a possible level of prevailing community reticence by some sectors, groups, or individuals. The continuity of response activities is facilitated by the close monitoring of the operational environment and the corresponding implementation of appropriate security measures. Additional risks are posed by the long duration of the current outbreak, fatigue amongst response staff, and ongoing strain on limited resources and funding.The abovementioned risks, coupled with high rates of population movement from outbreak affected areas to other areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and across porous borders to neighbouring countries, increase the risk of geographical spread \u2013 both within the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to neighbouring countries.

        "Description of the Situation": "On 17 July 2019, the Director-General convened the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (IHR) to review the situation on the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). It was the fourth time the Director-General convened the Committee for this event since the declaration of the outbreak in August 2018 (previous meetings were held in October 2018, April 2019, and June 2019). The Director-General accepted the Emergency Committee\u2019s recommendation that the outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The decision was based on the recent developments in the outbreak, including the geographical expansion of the virus. The declaration of the PHEIC is not a reflection on the performance of the response team but rather a measure that recognizes the possible increased national and regional risks and the need for intensified and coordinated action to manage them. The Committee and WHO do not recommend any restrictions on travel or trade, which can hamper the fight against Ebola by affecting the movement of people and supplies. Further information, including temporary recommendations advised by the Emergency Committee, is available in the\u00a0statement,\u00a0speech by WHO Director General, and\u00a0news release.The outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in North Kivu and Ituri provinces continued this past week with similar transmission intensity to recent weeks. While the stability of the transmission intensity of the outbreak is an indication of the strong response efforts to limit local transmission in affected health zones, the spread of EVD into new geographical areas and continued insecurity in the affected regions continue to complicate the control of the outbreak.A salient example of this is the confirmed case of EVD that was reported in Goma, a city of approximately two million inhabitants close to the Rwandan border, on 14 July 2019. The case was a man who travelled to the city from Beni by bus, visiting a local health centre on arrival where the alert was raised. He transferred the same day to the Ebola Treatment Centre (ETC) in Goma, and died while being transferred to the ETC in Butembo. The case\u2019s full travel history is known, and all contacts are being identified and followed-up. Vaccination of his contacts, and contacts of contacts, in Goma commenced on 15 July 2019. The confirmation of a case of EVD in the city of Goma had been long anticipated. Preparation activities, including the vaccination of health workers, intensive training in infection prevention and control, and heightened surveillance have been ongoing for more than six months. Neighbouring Rwanda is also conducting preparedness activities. Rumours of his contacts travelling to Bukavu, South Kivu, have been investigated and ruled out by response teams.In an unrelated event, two situation reports concerning Ebola Virus Disease in Uganda prepared and published by the Ugandan Ministry of Health, and posted on July 16 and July 17 on the WHO African Regional Office website, erroneously included unverified information. This information concerned the movements of a female fishmonger from Beni, who contracted EVD and travelled to a town in Uganda for one day, after which she returned to Beni, where she was admitted to the ETC. Ongoing investigations have suggested that the individual travelled to Uganda prior to onset of EVD. As it is not possible to conclusively rule out that she was infectious with EVD during her travels, both Ugandan and Democratic Republic of the Congo authorities are closely following potentially exposed contacts. There are currently no confirmed cases of EVD outside of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.In the last week, two Democratic Republic of the Congo nationals involved in the response, a community leader and local volunteer, were killed in separate locations in Beni; the underlying motive and possible relationship between these two killings in separate locations remain unknown at this time. Security forces are currently conducting an investigation into these two fatalities.In the 21 days from 26 June through 16 July 2019, 67 health areas within 20 health zones reported new cases, representing 10% of the 664 health areas within North Kivu and Ituri provinces (Figure 2). During this period, a total of 245 confirmed cases were reported, the majority of which were from the health zones of Beni (50%, n=123), Mabalako (15%, n=37), Katwa (7%, n=18), Mandima (4%, n=10) and Butembo (4%, n=9). As of 16 July 2019, a total of 2522 EVD cases, including 2428 confirmed and 94 probable cases, were reported (Table 1). Bunia, Kyondo and Musienene health zones all recently cleared 21 days since their last reported case. However, high risks remain for the virus to be reintroduced to these areas, requiring teams to remain fully resourced and vigilant.A total of 1698 deaths were reported (overall case fatality ratio 67%), including 1604 deaths among confirmed cases. Of the 2522 confirmed and probable cases with known age and sex, 56% (1423) were female, and 29% (720) were children aged less than 18 years. Cases continue to increase among health workers, with the cumulative number infected rising to 135 (5% of total cases).Figure 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by week of illness onset by health zone.

        "WHO Risk Assessment": "WHO continuously monitors changes to the epidemiological situation and context of the outbreak to ensure that support to the response is adapted to the evolving circumstances. The last assessment concluded that the national and regional risk levels remain very high, while global risk levels remain low. Weekly increases in the number of new cases were observed from February through mid-May 2019, with lower but still substantial rates since then. The security situation is characterised by the resurgence of activities from non-state armed groups in areas within all the three major areas of operations (Butembo, Beni, and Mangina). Increased ADF activities also led to clashes with FARDC in the northeast part of Beni. Local security forces conducted clearing operations and response activities were facilitated thereafter. Pockets of community reticence were observed during the period. However, recent community dialogue, outreach initiatives, and restoration of access to certain hotspot areas have resulted in some improvements in community acceptance of response activities and case investigation efforts. In order to facilitate staff safety and security, and continuity of activities, the operational area continues to be closely monitored and assessed, and security mitigation measures are implemented. The high proportion of community deaths reported among confirmed cases, relatively low proportion of new cases who were known contacts under surveillance, existence of transmission chains linked to nosocomial infection, persistent delays in detection and isolation in Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs), and challenges in the timely reporting and response to probable cases, are all factors increasing the likelihood of further chains of transmission in affected communities and increasing the risk of geographical spread both within the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to neighbouring countries. The high rates of population movement from outbreak affected areas to other areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and across porous borders to neighbouring countries during periods of heightened insecurity further compounds these risks. Additional risks are posed by the long duration of the current outbreak, fatigue amongst response staff, and ongoing strain on limited resources. Conversely, substantive operational readiness and preparedness activities in a number of neighbouring countries have likely increased capacity to rapidly detect cases and mitigate local spread. These efforts must continue to be scaled-up.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for travellers to/from the affected countries.

        "Description of the Situation": "The outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo continues this past week with a similar transmission intensity to the previous week. While the number of new cases continues to ease in former hotspots, such as Butembo, Katwa and Mandima health zones, there has been an increase in cases in Beni, and a high incidence of cases continues in parts of Mabalako Health Zone. In addition to these re-emerging hotspots, there are a large number of people with confirmed and probable infections moving to other health zones, with the greatest number coming from Beni Health Zone. The movement of cases causes the outbreak to spread to new health zones and re-emerge in health zones with previously controlled infections. Overall, this underscores the importance of robust mechanisms for listing and following up contacts and understanding the motivations for peoples\u2019 decisions to move.After the first reported case in the Ariwara Health Zone on 30 June, no new cases have been observed in that health zone. A response team deployed to that zone continues to identify contacts, engage the community, and vaccinate individuals at risk. Response personnel from the bordering countries of Uganda and South Sudan continue to support operational readiness activities. Resources are being dedicated to monitoring the Uganda-Democratic Republic of the Congo border in that area.In the 21 days from 19 June through 9 July 2019, 72 health areas within 22 health zones reported new cases, representing 11% of the 664 health areas within North Kivu and Ituri provinces (Figure 2). During this period, a total of 247 confirmed cases were reported, the majority of which were from the health zones of Beni (41%, n=101), Mabalako (19%, n=48), Lubero (6%, n=16), and Mandima (5%, n=13). As of 09 July 2019, a total of 2437 EVD cases, including 2343 confirmed and 94 probable cases, were reported (Table 1). A total of 1646 deaths were reported (overall case fatality ratio 68%), including 1552 deaths among confirmed cases. Of the 2437 confirmed and probable cases with known age and sex, 57% (1384) were female, and 29% (704) were children aged less than 18 years.Cases continue to increase among health workers, with the cumulative number infected rising to 132 (5% of total cases). Of the 128 health workers with information available, the greatest proportion is among health workers at health posts [poste de sant\u00e9] (20%, n = 26) and private health facilities (35%, n = 45). The majority (68%, n = 87) of health worker infections were among nurses.No new EVD cases or deaths have been reported in the Republic of Uganda since the\u00a0previous EVD Disease Outbreak News publication on 13 June 2019. As of 3 July, 108 contacts exposed to those cases were identified, and they all completed the 21-day follow-up period. All contacts were asymptomatic. Arua district, located in the north-western part of Uganda near the Uganda-Democratic Republic of the Congo border, is currently stepping up its response readiness to prevent imported cases of Ebola following the case that died on 30 June 2019 in Ariwara Health Zone in neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo, located 8 kilometres from the Uganda border. This case is known to have over 200 contacts, some of whom are in the communities bordering the Arua district. As of 9 July 2019, two suspected cases in the Arua district were reported and both tested negative. As of 9 July 2019, the cumulative number of individuals vaccinated in Arua district is 811 out of 1092 targeted front line and healthcare workers.Figure 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by week of illness onset by health zone.

        "Description of the Situation": "The outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo continued with a steady transmission intensity this week. Indicators demonstrated the early signs of transmission easing in intensity in some major hotspots, such as Butembo and Katwa. The current hotspots are the health zones of Beni, Mabalako, and Mandima, with some cases being exported from these hotspot areas into unaffected health zones. There is a slight but notable increase in the number of new cases occurring in areas that previously had lower rates of transmission, such as the Komanda, Lubero, and Rwampara/ Bunia health zones. On 30 June, a case who had travelled overland from Beni was confirmed in Ariwara, more than 460 kilometres north of Beni, towards the borders with Uganda and South Sudan. This is the first confirmed case in this health zone, and a response team was deployed from Bunia to investigate and implement public health actions in Ariwara. Uganda and South Sudan have mobilized quickly, building on the preparedness efforts during the last months. Arua district in Uganda shares a border with Ariwara health zone, with high volume of trade and population movement. The Arua District Task Force in Arua mobilized on 2 July to agree on a plan of action, the Ministry of Health (MoH) immediately dispatched the National Rapid Response Team for needs assessment, and the vaccination team from Kasese was also dispatched to Arua district on 3 July to start vaccinating the front-line health workers. In South Sudan, WHO and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) convened a joint meeting with implementing partners on 2 July to plan and coordinate field missions. Joint teams were dispatched to Yei State on 3 July to support operational readiness activities.In the 21 days from 12 June through 02 July 2019, 73 health areas within 20 health zones reported new cases, representing 11% of the 664 health areas within North Kivu and Ituri provinces (Figure 2). During this period, a total of 285 confirmed cases were reported, the majority of which were from the health zones of Mabalako (30%, n=85), Beni (27%, n=76), Mandima (8%, n=23), Lubero (6%, n=16) and Kalunguta (5%, n=14). As of 02 July 2019, a total of 2369 EVD cases, including 2275 confirmed and 94 probable cases, were reported (Table 1). A total of 1598 deaths were reported (overall case fatality ratio 68%), including 1504 deaths among confirmed cases. Of the 2369 confirmed and probable cases with known age and sex, 56% (1334) were female, and 29% (691) were children aged less than 18 years. Cases continue to rise among health workers, with the cumulative number infected rising to 130 (6% of total cases).No new EVD cases or deaths have been reported in the Republic of Uganda since the previous EVD Disease Outbreak News publication on 13 June 2019. As of 26 June, 108 exposed contacts were identified, and they are in the process of completing the 21-day follow-up period. Contacts are visited daily for 21 days until the last contact completes follow-up on 3 July. All contacts remain asymptomatic to date. All 14 suspected cases reported to date have tested negative for EVD, and these cases are not related to the confirmed cases mentioned in the\u00a0Disease Outbreak News on EVD in Uganda. Cumulatively, 1507 individuals consented and were vaccinated, including 74 contacts (34 were not eligible for vaccination), 747 contacts of contacts and 682 frontline health workers.Figure 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by week of illness onset by health zone.

        "Description of the Situation": "On 11 June 2019, the Ugandan Ministry of Health (MoH) has confirmed a case of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in Kasese district, Uganda. The patient is a 5-year-old child from the Democratic Republic of the Congo who travelled with his family from Mabalako Health Zone in Democratic Republic of the Congo after attending, on 1 June 2019, the funeral of his grandfather (confirmed EVD case on 2 June 2019). On 10 June 2019, the child and the family entered the country through Bwera border post and sought medical care at Kagando hospital where health workers identified Ebola as a possible cause of illness. The child was transferred to Bwera Ebola Treatment Unit (ETU) for management. The confirmation of Ebola Virus was made on 11 June 2019 at the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI), and the child has deceased in the early hours of 12 June 2019. Two other suspected cases, a 50-year-old female (grandmother of the first case) and 3-year-old male (younger brother of the first case) part of the family members who travelled together with the first confirmed child were also admitted in the same ETU and were confirmed for EVD by UVRI on 12 June 2019. The 50 year-old-female died during the night between 12 and 13 June. 27 other contacts have been identified and are being monitored. Healthcare workers from both health care facilities where the child was treated have been previously vaccinated.Public health response Since 7 November 2018, as part of the preparedness activities, Uganda has vaccinated health and frontline workers in areas at risk of expansion of the outbreak. To date, 4699 health care and frontline workers from 165 health facilities have been vaccinated.The MoH and WHO have dispatched a Rapid Response Team to Kasese to identify other people who may be at risk, and ensure they are monitored and provided with care if they become ill. Nine Ebola Treatment Units (ETU) are in place in the districts bordering North Kivu and Ituri. The MoH is setting up more units in the affected district and at referral hospitals to handle cases if they occur.The MoH is intensifying community education, psychosocial support and will undertake vaccination for those who have come in contact with the patient and at-risk health workers who were not previously vaccinated. Disease monitoring has been intensified at border posts, health centres and communities, and health workers are being trained on recognizing symptoms of the disease. The district administration and local councils in the affected area have been directed to ensure that any person with Ebola signs and symptoms in the community is reported to the health workers immediately and provided with advice and testing.WHO is also supporting the Ministry of Health in terms of;Finalization of the response planOperational and logistics support including immediate shipment of vaccines and therapeuticsResource mobilization Deployment of experts on infection prevention and control (IPE), therapeutics, risk communication and community engagement (RCCE), and vaccinationCompliance to SAGE Ebola vaccination protocol and Monitored Emergency Use of Unregistered and Investigational Interventions (MEURI) for Ebola Virus Disease framework for therapeuticsWHO risk assessment All three confirmed cases are imported from Democratic Republic of the Congo and belong to the same family who travelled together from Mabalako Health Zone, an area currently affected by Ebola outbreak in North Kivu, Democratic Republic of the Congo. To date, they remain as a single episode of EVD in Uganda, and the geographical spread in Uganda appears to be limited to one district near Democratic Republic of the Congo border. Further investigations are ongoing both in Uganda and Democratic Republic of the Congo to assess the full extent of the outbreak.Since the beginning of the Ebola outbreak in Democratic Republic of the Congo in August 2018, WHO has advised neighbouring countries (Priority 1 countries: Uganda, Rwanda, South Sudan, and Burundi / Priority 2 countries: Angola, Zambia, Tanzania, Central African Republic and Republic of Congo) to reinforce their preparedness measures.Considering that to date i) the EVD cases confirmed in Uganda were epidemiologically linked to the Democratic Republic of the Congo; ii) all three cases belong to single family cluster with a common high-risk exposure to a confirmed case, iii) the level of preparedness and the proven experience of Ugandan authorities to manage previous EVD outbreaks, and iv) the rapidity of the detection and a limited geographical area affected (Kasese district), the overall level of risk at national level is assessed as moderate. Moreover, given that there is no evidence of local transmission of EVD in Uganda and the location of the outbreak being close to the Democratic Republic of the Congo border, the overall risk posed at regional level by the Ugandan outbreak is considered low. However, the overall regional risk posed by the outbreak in Democratic Republic of the Congo remains very high. The overall risk at international level remains low.The Director-General will convene a third meeting of the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) following the most recent risk assessment which noted a cross-border spread of Ebola from Democratic Republic of the Congo to Uganda. WHO has convened the emergency committee under International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) twice (October 2018 and April 2019) since the outbreak in Democratic Republic of the Congo was announced in August. The committee will discuss whether the event constitute a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC).WHO advice WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to Uganda based on the currently available information. WHO continues to monitor travel and trade measures in relation to this event, and currently there are no restrictions of the international traffic in place.For more information, please see:SAGE recommendations Ebola virus disease fact sheet",

        "Description of the Situation": "The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) continues to show a decrease in the number of new cases in hotspots such as Katwa, Beni and Kalunguta health zones. However, in other areas such as Mabalako and Butembo, moderate rates of transmission continue. With ongoing EVD transmission within communities in 12 health zones in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, factors such as persistent delays in case detection, approximately a third of cases dying outside of Ebola treatment or transit centres, and high population mobility, pose a high risk of geographical spread both within the DRC and to neighbouring countries. This was highlighted by the recent exportation of cases to Uganda \u2013 the first confirmed cases detected outside of North Kivu and Ituri province since the onset of the outbreak over 10 months ago. For more information, please see Disease Outbreak News on EVD in UgandaWeekly decrease in the incidence of new cases have been reported in several health zones; however, increase or a continuation of the outbreak has been observed in others (Figure 1). In the 21 days, between 22 May to 11 June 2019, 62 health areas within 12 health zones reported new cases, representing 9% of the 664 health areas within North Kivu and Ituri provinces (Figure 2). During this period, a total of 212 confirmed cases were reported, the majority of which were from the health zones of Mabalako (33%, n=69), Butembo (18%, n=39), Katwa (14%, n=30) Mandima (11%, n=23) and Beni (9%, n=20). Single confirmed cases were also reported from Rwampara and Komanda health zones this past week following a prolonged period since the last reported case, with both cases acquiring the infection in the aforementioned hotspots. As of 11 June 2019, a total of 2084 EVD cases, including 1990 confirmed and 94 probable cases, were reported. A total of 1405 deaths were reported (overall case fatality ratio 67%), including 1311 deaths among confirmed cases. Of the 2084 confirmed and probable cases with known age and sex, 57% (1194) were female, and 29% (605) were children aged less than 18 years. Cases continue to rise among health workers, with the cumulative number infected rising to 118 (6% of total cases).Taking these recent events into consideration, the WHO Director-General will convene the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (IHR) on 14 June 2019. The independent group of public health experts will provide their views to the Director-General on whether the event constitutes a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). If the event is determined to constitute a PHEIC, the Director-General will issue Temporary Recommendations, which are usually health measures aimed at reducing the international spread of Ebola and avoiding unnecessary interference with international traffic. A statement giving an account of the meeting and its conclusions will be posted on the WHO website immediately after the meeting.Figure 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by week of illness onset by health zone.

        "Description of the Situation": "6 June 2019\n\n \nAs the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak surpasses the 2000 case mark, indicators over the past two weeks provide early signs of an easing of the transmission intensity. This follows a period of improved security and therefore access to communities, allowing response teams to operate more freely. A total of 88 confirmed cases were reported each week for the past two epidemiological weeks, down from a peak of 126 cases per week observed in April. Declines in the incidence of new cases have been most apparent in hotspots such as Katwa, Mandima and Beni health zones. Concurrently, improvements in the proportion of cases among contacts registered prior to onset (up from 30% three weeks ago to 55% last week), and a lower proportion of cases resulting from transmission within community health facilities (from 31% during the first week of April 2019 to 9% during the last week of May 2019), are encouraging. Nevertheless, both indicators are below where we would aim to be. The outbreak continues to be contained within 12 active health zones in North Kivu and Ituri provinces. \n\nHowever, substantive rates of transmission continue within affected communities, and further waves of the outbreak may be expected. An increase in the incidence of new cases has been reported from Mabalako Health Zone in recent weeks, and high infection rates continue within Butembo metropolitan. Times between detecting, reporting and admission of cases at Ebola treatment/transit centres (ETCs) remains too long (median 6 days, interquartile range 4\u20139 days in the past 3 weeks), with about a third (34% in the past 3 weeks) of cases dying outside of ETCs. Collectively these indicators highlight that the risks associated with this outbreak remain very high.\n\nIn the 21 days between 15 May to 4 June 2019, 80 health areas within 12 health zones reported new cases, representing 12% of the 664 health areas within North Kivu and Ituri provinces (Table 1 and Figure 2). During this period, a total of 280 confirmed cases were reported, the majority of which were from the Mabalako (27%, n=75), Butembo (23%, n=63), Katwa (16%, n=44), Beni (11%, n=30), Kalunguta (8%, n=23), Mandima (7%, n=19) and Musienene (5%, n=14) health zones.\n\nAs of 4 June 2019, a total of 2025 EVD cases, including 1931 confirmed and 94 probable cases, were reported. A total of 1357 deaths were reported (overall case fatality ratio 67%), including 1263 deaths among confirmed cases. Of the 2025 confirmed and probable cases with known age and sex, 58% (1170) were female, and 29% (589) were children aged less than 18 years. The number of healthcare workers affected has risen to 110 (5% of total cases).\nFigure 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by week of illness onset by health zone.

        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "30 May 2019\n\n \nA decline in the number of confirmed Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases has been reported this week (22 to 28 May). Over the past seven days, a total of 73 new confirmed cases were reported compared to the previous where 127 new confirmed cases were reported. This should be interpreted with caution given the complex operating environment and fragility of the security situation. Katwa, one of the epicenters of the outbreak, reported fewer cases this week and other health zones such as Mabalako, Kalunguta and Mandima have also seen a decline in case reporting. Active transmission was reported in 14 of the 22 health zones that have been affected to date. Other initial encouraging findings such as a lower proportion of reported nosocomial infections, a lower proportion of community deaths and a higher proportion of registered contacts at case detection have also been reported. Weekly fluctuations in these indicators have been reported in the past and uncertainties remain with regards to the ability of the surveillance system to identify all new cases in areas faced with ongoing insecurity. Operations are still regularly hampered by security issues, and the risk of national and regional spread remains very high.\n\nMabalako reported 24% (73/309) of the new confirmed cases in the past 21 days. Nine out of the 12 Mabalako health areas have reported new confirmed cases during this period. In the 21 days between 8 to 28 May 2019, 83 health areas within 14 health zones reported new cases, representing 46% of the 180 health areas affected to date (Table 1 and Figure 2). During this period, a total of 309 confirmed cases were reported, the majority of which were from the Mabalako (24%, n=73), Butembo (21%, n=64), Katwa (14%, n=42), Beni (11%, n=34), Kalunguta (10%, n=31), Musienene (7%, n=23) and Mandima (6%, n=20) health zones.\n\nAs of 28 May 2019, a total of 1945 EVD cases, including 1851 confirmed and 94 probable cases, were reported. A total of 1302 deaths were reported (overall case fatality ratio 67%), including 1208 deaths among confirmed cases. Of the 1945 confirmed and probable cases with known age and sex, 58% (1122) were female, and 29% (572) were children aged less than 18 years. The number of healthcare workers affected has risen to 108 (6% of total cases).\n\nAll alerts in affected areas, in other provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and in neighbouring countries continue to be monitored and investigated. To date, EVD has been ruled out in all alerts outside the outbreak affected areas. On 3 June, a pilgrimage is planned to Namugongo, Uganda to commemorate the death of Catholics and Anglican martyrs. Preparedness activities surrounding the pilgrimage are ongoing.\nEVD Cases in Under Five-Year Olds\n\nWHO periodically conducts in-depth epidemiological analyses so that data can help reveal any gaps and drive evidence-based response improvements. An in-depth analysis of EVD cases in children under five-years of age demonstrated some noteworthy trends. As of 28 May, children under the age of five accounted for 15% (300/1949) of EVD cases reported, with children under one year of age accounting for 6% (118/1949). Of the 300 cases in children under the age of five, 19 were probable cases (19/94, 20% of all probable cases).\n\nData indicate that children under the age of five are being brought into healthcare facilities sooner than cases over the age of five (2.4 days vs. 3.2 days respectively), but most of these cases are not being referred to ETCs, and instead attend multiple local healthcare facilities. These cases visited on average 1.5 healthcare facilities, compared to 1.2 healthcare facilities for cases aged over five-years of age. These observations show that in general, parents are willing to seek medical attention for their children at healthcare facilities but are reluctant to bringing their children to ETCs, perhaps out of fear of being far from home and without the support of family members. More work needs to be done to reduce fear and misunderstanding of ETCs and to reduce any other barriers to access, with a special focus on this age group. All cases that may not be adequately isolated including children under five-years of age may pose a considerable transmission risk to healthcare workers, patients, and members of the community. \n\nWith regards to contact-tracing, 28% of EVD cases under five-years of age are registered as contacts, compared to 41% in cases over five-years of age. Although EVD cases under five years of age are less frequently listed as contacts, proportions of cases both below and over five-years of age are under surveillance remain similar (18% vs. 20% respectively). The reasons underlying these low figures are unclear at this time and further investigations are ongoing. \n\nAs of 28 May, the overall case fatality rate (CFR) of EVD cases in children under the age of five stands at 77%. This CFR was notably higher than that of EVD cases over five-years of age at 57%. These figures are in line with those observed in the 2014 West Africa EVD outbreak1 . There are a number of possible explanations for the higher CFR in this vulnerable population: the lower proportion of cases that present to ETCs, higher baseline mortalities in this population in general, and the inability to vaccinate cases who were not listed as contacts. Community deaths (i.e. any EVD deaths occurring outside of Ebola treatment centres/Transit centres (ETCs/TCs) account for 76% of deaths due to EVD in children under the age of five and 65% above the age of five. Of the community deaths of children under the age of five, 54% died in a healthcare facility.\n\nAs expected, the CFRs of EVD cases both younger and older than five-years of age (50% and 39% respectively) who sought treatment at ETCs is markedly lower than those who did not (86% and 68% respectively). The relative difference in CFRs between the two groups reduces upon admission into an ETC. This again reinforces the need to continue strengthening efforts to work with communities to encourage all affected populations, and in particular parents of young children, to seek treatment at ETCs as early as possible in order to give them the best chance of survival. Overall, the fact that these observed trends indicate that while it is promising to see lower CFRs in young children treated in ETCs, and to see that parents are willing to seek medical attention for their children at healthcare facilities, much emphasis needs to be made at improving contact listing of children under five years of age and encouraging parents to bring their children to be treated in ETCs. It must also be stressed that the proportions and resultant associations described above must be interpreted with caution given the often-limited demographic information available and are subject to change due to the fluid nature of the ongoing EVD outbreak.\n\nEfforts are ongoing to encourage community-based facilities to refer suspected cases to ETCs/TCs, however these activities can be further strengthened. Children of all ages, including infants, that have suspected or confirmed EVD, are cared for at ETUs with specific optimized, supportive care protocols. Paediatric-specific equipment, medicines and trained specialists are available to provide clinical support at ETCs for this age group. All confirmed children are also rapidly enrolled in investigational therapeutic protocols after informed consent is obtained. Children receive nutritional care and psychosocial support from psychologists while at the ETC and are cared for 24/7 by care providers from survivors so they are not alone. As with all age groups, infants and young children are offered support via a specialized programme of care for Ebola survivors. In addition, pregnant women that have survived EVD are followed closely in the survivor program and return to ETCs for delivery by a multi-disciplinary team that has obstetric and paediatric expertise. \n\nIn light of these findings, UNICEF and WHO are working with partners in supporting activities related to nutritional care and psychosocial support of EVD patients, particularly for parents and children. These include supporting and providing information related to infant feeding for children separated from their parents or orphaned. UNICEF is working with EVD survivors and creating infant and young child feeding (IYCF) counselling support groups. They are also supporting the screening of malnourished children under two years old and their referral to Nutritional Units for assistance. Psychosocial support and material assistance are being conducted in outbreak areas where nurseries for children who have been separated from their mothers are set up and psychosocial support is provided to family members accompanying EVD affected persons and their contacts. \n\n\n1Ebola Virus Disease among Children in West Africa \n\nFigure 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by week of illness onset by health zone.

The last assessment concluded that the national and regional risk levels remain very high, while global risk levels remain low. Weekly increases in the number of new cases has been ongoing since late February 2019. A general deterioration of the security situation, and the persistence of pockets of community mistrust exacerbated by political tensions and insecurity, have resulted in recurrent temporary suspension and delays of case investigation and response activities in affected areas, reducing the overall effectiveness of interventions. However, recent community dialogue, outreach initiatives, and restoration of access to certain hotspot areas have resulted in some improvements in community acceptance of response activities and case investigation efforts. The high proportion of community deaths reported among confirmed cases, relatively low proportion of new cases who were known contacts under surveillance, existence of transmission chains linked to nosocomial infection, persistent delays in detection and isolation in ETCs, and challenges in the timely reporting and response to probable cases, are all factors increasing the likelihood of further chains of transmission in affected communities and increasing the risk of geographical spread both within the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to neighbouring countries. The high rates of population movement occurring from outbreak affected areas to other areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and across porous borders to neighbouring countries during periods of heightened insecurity further compounds these risks. Additional risks are posed by the long duration of the current outbreak, fatigue amongst response staff, and ongoing strain on limited resources. Conversely, substantive operational readiness and preparedness activities in a number of neighbouring countries have likely increased capacity to rapidly detect cases and mitigated local spread. However, these efforts must continue to be scaled-up at this time. \nWHO advice \n\nWHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information.

        "Description of the Situation": "24 May 2019\n\n \nOn 9 May 2019, the Global Polio Laboratory Network (GPLN) notified WHO of the detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) from an environmental sewage sample collected on 20 April 2019 in Konarak district, Sistan-Baluchistan province, Islamic Republic of Iran. The virus was detected in an environmental sample only, and to date, no associated cases of paralysis have been detected. \n\nThe subsequent scheduled sewage sample collected from the same site on 4 May 2019 (2 weeks after the positive sample) tested negative for poliovirus. \n\nThe affected province borders both Baluchistan province in Pakistan, and part of Southern Region in Afghanistan. Genetic sequencing confirmed that the virus isolated is most closely linked to WPV1 currently circulating in Karachi region (Sindh province) in Pakistan. \n\nThe last laboratory-confirmed indigenous wild polio case from the Islamic Republic of Iran was reported in 1997. From 1998-2000, cases of wild poliovirus were imported from Pakistan and Afghanistan. No polio cases have been confirmed since 2001. Routine immunization against polio has been mandatory since 1984. Highly organized and well-implemented national immunization days were held during the period from 1994 to 1998. Since 1999, supplementary immunization activities in high-risk areas and populations including province of Sistan-Baluchistan are conducted annually. \nPublic health response\n\nThe Ministry of Health and Medical Education (MOHME) and local health authorities are undertaking a detailed investigation, and partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) are providing support as required. The findings reconfirmed that immunization and surveillance systems in the Islamic Republic of Iran are strong.\nWHO risk assessment\n\nWHO assesses the risk of international spread of WPV-1 from the Islamic Republic of Iran to be low. The risk assessment suggests that this event has limited public health implications, given Iran\u2019s very high levels of routine immunization coverage for OPV3 (3 doses of oral polio vaccine), estimated at 99%, and strong disease surveillance. \n\nHowever, this event reinforces the importance of implementing the Temporary Recommendations of the International Health Regulations (IHR) committee regarding the international spread of poliovirus by the Member States infected with WPV1, which include Afghanistan and Pakistan. \nWHO advice\n\nPolio is a highly infectious disease and can cause permanent paralysis or death. The poliovirus can spread easily and over large distances.\n\nIt is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travellers and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases in order to rapidly detect any new virus importation and to facilitate a rapid response.\n\nCountries, territories and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction.\n\nWHO\u2019s International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to polio-affected areas should be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents (and visitors for more than 4 weeks) from infected areas should receive an additional dose of OPV or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) within 4 weeks to 12 months of travel. \n\nThe twentieth meeting of the Emergency Committee under IHR regarding the international spread of poliovirus, held in February 2019 concluded that the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and recommended the extension of Temporary Recommendations for a further three months.\n\nTo comply with the Temporary Recommendations issued under the PHEIC, States infected with wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1), circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) or circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 3 (cVDPV3) with potential risk of international spread, and states infected with circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) with potential risk of international spread should declare the outbreak as a national public health emergency and consider vaccination of all international travellers. \nFor more information:\n\n\nGlobal Polio Eradication Initiative \n\nEMRO country profile for Islamic Republic of Iran \n\nWHO/UNICEF estimates of national routine immunization \n\nWHO vaccine-preventable diseases: monitoring system, 2018 global summary \n\nInternational Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis \n\nWHO International Travel and Health, Chapter 6 Vaccine-preventable diseases and vaccines",

        "Description of the Situation": "23 May 2019\n\n \nAlthough this past week continues to bear witness to a steady rise in the number of Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the overall security situation has allowed for the resumption of most response activities. While no major insecurity incidents have occurred, outbreak response teams, local healthcare workers, and community members cooperating with response efforts, are increasingly subjected to threats made against them by armed groups present in hotspot areas such as Katwa and Butembo. These threats are often disseminated through leaflets or direct intimidation. Armed groups\u2019 presence, activities and increasing direct threats against response teams continue to be reported in other EVD affected areas, in particular Lubero, Masereka, Mabalako, Kalunguta, and Vuhovi, resulting in some healthcare workers being unwilling to don personal protective equipment or perform critical Infection Prevention Control (IPC) measures out of fear of violence being levied against them or the healthcare facilities where they operate. \n\nDuring the past three weeks, reports indicate that transmission remains most intense in seven main hotspot areas: Beni, Butembo, Kalunguta, Katwa, Mabalako, Mandima, and Musienene. Collectively, these health zones account for the vast majority (93%) of the 349 cases reported in the last 21 days between 1 - 21 May 2019 (Figure 1 and Table 1). During this period, new cases were reported from 91 health areas within 15 of the 22 health zones affected to date (Figure 2). \n\nAs of 21 May, a total of 1866 confirmed and probable EVD cases have been reported, of which 1241 died (case fatality ratio 67%). Of the total cases with recorded sex and age, 56% (1051) were female and 30% (545) were children aged less than 18 years. The number of healthcare workers affected has risen to 105 (6% of total cases). 490 EVD patients who received care at ETCs have been successfully discharged.\nFigure 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by week of illness onset by health zone.

The last assessment concluded that the national and regional risk levels remain very high, while global risk levels remain low. Weekly increases in the number of new cases has been ongoing since late February 2019. A general deterioration of the security situation, and the persistence of pockets of community mistrust exacerbated by political tensions and insecurity, have resulted in recurrent temporary suspension and delays of case investigation and response activities in affected areas, reducing the overall effectiveness of interventions. However, recent community dialogue, outreach initiatives, and restoration of access to certain hotspot areas have resulted in some improvements in community acceptance of response activities and case investigation efforts. The high proportion of community deaths reported among confirmed cases, relatively low proportion of new cases who were known contacts under surveillance, existence of transmission chains linked to nosocomial infection, persistent delays in detection and isolation in ETCs, and challenges in the timely reporting and response to probable cases, are all factors increasing the likelihood of further chains of transmission in affected communities and increasing the risk of geographical spread both within the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to neighbouring countries. The high rates of population movement occurring from outbreak affected areas to other areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and across porous borders to neighbouring countries during periods of heightened insecurity further compounds these risks. Additional risks are posed by the long duration of the current outbreak, fatigue amongst response staff, and ongoing strain on limited resources. Conversely, substantive operational readiness and preparedness activities in a number of neighbouring countries have likely increased capacity to rapidly detect cases and mitigated local spread. However, these efforts must continue to be scaled-up at this time. \nWHO advice \n\nWHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for passengers leaving the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.\n\nFor more information, please see:\n\n\nPress briefing on Ebola, WHO Director-General Dr Tedros \n\nWHO Director-General reiterates commitment to Ebola response despite another attack \n\nWHO expresses concern over damage to Ebola treatment facilities in DRC \n\nHighlights from the April 2019 meeting of the IHR Emergency Committee on the EVD outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo \n\nSAGE interim recommendations on vaccination against EVD, 20 February 2019 \n\nWHO Interim recommendation Ebola vaccines \n\nEbola response in Democratic Republic of the Congo risks slowdown \n\nWHO recommendations for international travellers related to the Ebola Virus Disease outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo \n\nEbola virus disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo \u2013 Operational readiness and preparedness in neighbouring countries\n\n\nEbola virus disease fact sheet",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 16 March 2018, WHO was notified by the National International Health Regulations (IHR) Focal Point of France, through the European Commission Early Warning and Response System, of an increase in the number of dengue cases reported on La R\u00e9union Island, France, since the beginning of 2018.",
        "Description of the Situation": "20 May 2019\n\n \nOn 16 March 2018, WHO was notified by the National International Health Regulations (IHR) Focal Point of France, through the European Commission Early Warning and Response System, of an increase in the number of dengue cases reported on La R\u00e9union Island, France, since the beginning of 2018.\n\nAccording to the local health authority (Agence R\u00e9gionale de Sant\u00e9 Oc\u00e9an Indien) and the regional office of Sant\u00e9 publique France in La R\u00e9union, a total of 6942 confirmed locally acquired cases of dengue fever were reported in R\u00e9union in 2018, a 6000% increase from 2017 when 100 cases were reported. From 1 January through 30 April 2019, over 7700 confirmed cases have been reported. Also, as of 30 April 2019, 50 000 probable cases have been reported on the island since 2018, with 22 000 probable cases reported in 2019. Overall, fourteen deaths related (seven directly related) to dengue infections have been reported since 2018. Dengue-related emergency room visits have increased from 475 visits in 2018 to 1102 visits in 2019. Likewise, the number of hospitalizations has increased from twelve in 2017 to 156 in 2018 and 271 in 2019 as of 30 April 2019. According to local authorities, hospital capacities are still sufficient to handle cases.\n\nThe southern parts of the island are the most affected areas with cases dispersed across settlements with known prior transmission in Etang-Sal\u00e9, Les Avirons, Saint-Joseph and Petite-Ile Saint-Louis. The number of cases in the western and northern parts of the island are also increasing and new areas of transmission have been detected weekly in all parts of the island since March 2019.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2016, the predominant circulating serotypes were DENV-1, DENV-2 and DENV-3. Since 2017, the most commonly reported serotype was DENV-2, with DENV-1 and DENV-4 being occasionally reported among imported cases. However, as of 24 April 2019, fourteen locally acquired cases of DENV-1 have been reported. \n\nThe competent vectors, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes are both found on La R\u00e9union island. However, Ae. albopictus had the highest relative abundance and Ae. aegypti larvae are only found on the west coast of the island.\n\nPublic health response\n\nNotification of dengue fever has been mandatory on La R\u00e9union island since 2006. On 10 July 2018, local authorities raised the level of emergency risk of the civil security plan to level 4, corresponding to a medium-level epidemic. This risk level is still valid to date. The local health authority (Agence R\u00e9gionale de Sant\u00e9 - Oc\u00e9an Indien) and the regional office of Sant\u00e9 publique France in La R\u00e9union are currently following the situation and a number of actions have been implemented on La R\u00e9union island by local authorities:\n\nStrengthened vector control measures, focusing primarily around the areas were dengue cases are reported. The vector control team workforce is being supported by local subsidized contracts and civil protection staff from La R\u00e9union and mainland France; rapid diagnostic tests have also been distributed, including to emergency rooms, for early diagnosis of acute dengue infection;\nEnhanced surveillance of cases;\nStrengthening of substances of human origin (SoHo) safety measures for cell, tissue and organ donations including viral genome detection screening of every donation;\nSocial mobilization including local representatives\u2019 mobilization in municipalities and districts, awareness campaigns at school and door-to-door operations to inform the population on exposures and remove mosquito breeding sites. A specific guide for dengue fever control was designed and distributed to local and regional elected officials and communities;\nSpecific risk communication, aimed at raising dengue fever awareness in the public and among healthcare workers, including posters at points of entry of the country, oral communication on flights to and from La R\u00e9union, weekly press releases and communication on local TV and radios;\nStrengthen hospital capacity to provide care to severe dengue cases, and if necessary to increase the capacities in health care services for dengue cases.\n\nWHO risk assessment\n\nThe first documented dengue outbreak occurred in 1977\u20131978 and affected approximately 30% of the population of La Reunion. Subsequently, locally acquired sporadic cases and clusters of dengue fever have been reported. However, the upsurge of confirmed and probable cases reported in 2018 is unprecedented. This could be partly explained by:\n\nan increase in the viral load of asymptomatic cases over the threshold values of infectivity for mosquito vectors;\nlack of herd immunity in the local population for the prevailing serotype, but also for other co-circulating serotypes, thus favoring further transmission of the virus; \nco-circulation of different serotypes (since 2014) may result in more severe hemorrhagic fever cases and increase in deaths, in particular among secondary cases.\n\n\nLa R\u00e9union is a popular touristic destination and the current outbreak increases the likelihood of exporting dengue virus to other countries. In addition, the high number of travelers from other dengue endemic countries also pose the risk of introducing other serotypes of dengue to La R\u00e9union.\nWHO advice\n\nWHO recommends Integrated Vector Management (IVM) activities to remove potential breeding sites, reduce vector populations and minimize individual exposures, as currently implemented by the local authorities, including vector control strategies targeting both the immature (i.e. environmental management, and chemical and biological control measures) and adult stages of the vector. Other IVM strategies can protect individuals and households; \nVector control activities should target all settings where human\u2013vector contact occurs (e.g. place of residence, workplaces, schools, hospitals); where indoor biting occurs, household insecticide aerosol products, mosquito coils or other insecticide vaporizers may also reduce biting activity. Household fixtures such as window and door screens and air-conditioning may also prevent biting;\nSince the Aedes mosquitoes (the primary vector for transmission) are day biting mosquitoes, personal protective measures such as use of clothing that minimizes skin exposure during daylight hours is recommended. Repellents may be applied to exposed skin or to clothing. The use of repellents must be in strict accordance with label instructions;\nInsecticide treated mosquito nets afford good protection for those who sleep during the day (e.g. infants, people confined to beds due to illness or age, dengue patients and night shift workers); and\nThere is currently no specific treatment for dengue fever. Prompt diagnosis and management of dengue fever patients can significantly reduce mortality rates from severe dengue.\n\n\nFor more information on Dengue fever in la R\u00e9union:\n\n\nWHO Dengue control\n\n\nGlobal Strategy for dengue prevention and control, 2012\u20132020 \n\n\nDengue and severe dengue WHO fact sheet \n\nImproved tools and strategies for the prevention and control of arboviral diseases: A research-to-policy forum, PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases \n\nWHO Disease Outbreak News \n\n\nIntensification de la circulation de la dengue \u00e0 la R\u00e9union, Cire Oc\u00e9an Indien \n\nRapid Risk Assessment: Dengue outbreak in R\u00e9union, France, 16 Apr 2018 \n\nEpidemiological situation update \n\nLutte anti-vectorielle, Les services de l'\u00c9tat \u00e0 La R\u00e9union \n\nAgence de Sant\u00e9 Oc\u00e9an Indien (ARS OI), Saint Denis, R\u00e9union, France \n\nBhatt S, Gething PW, Brady OJ, Messina JP, Farlow AW, Moyes CL et al.

        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "16 May 2019\nOn 9 May 2019, the Ministry of Health (MOH) in Singapore notified WHO of one laboratory-confirmed case of monkeypox. The case-patient is a 38 year old Nigerian man who arrived in Singapore on 28 April 2019 and attended a workshop from 29-30 April. Prior to his travel to Singapore, he had worked in the Delta state in Nigeria, and had attended a wedding on 21 April 2019 in a village in Ebonyi State, Nigeria.The patient developed fever, muscle aches, chills and skin rash on 30 April. He reported that he had remained in his hotel room most of the time between 1 and 7 May. He was transferred to a public hospital by ambulance on 7 May and referred to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on the same day, where he was isolated for further management. Skin lesion samples were taken on 8 May and tested positive for monkeypox virus by the National Public Health Laboratory on the same day. He is currently in a stable condition.Public health responseBased on investigations thus far, authorities in Singapore have traced and contacted a total of 23 close contacts, including 18 participants and trainers who attended the same workshop, one staff at the workshop venue, and four hotel staff who had close contact with the affected individual. Healthcare workers who were in contact with the patient had used personal protection equipment. MOH\u2019s investigation and contact tracing operations are ongoing.One of the 18 workshop participants had left Singapore before the patient was diagnosed. This contact is a Nigerian national who travelled by air to Nigeria on 5 May. The Nigerian national IHR focal point has been provided with details of the contact for follow up action, as necessary. Potential sources of exposure and possible epidemiological links within Nigeria are currently being investigated.\nClose contacts of the affected individual were referred to NCID for further assessment and offered post-exposure prophylaxis with smallpox vaccination, which can prevent disease or reduce the severity of symptoms. As of 15 May 2019, 14 persons were vaccinated. As a precautionary measure, close contacts have been quarantined either at home or designated government quarantine facility and monitored for 21 days from their date of exposure to the confirmed case. If anyone develops symptoms, they will be treated at NCID. All other contacts, who have a low risk of being infected, have been placed under active surveillance, and will be contacted twice daily to monitor their health status.Singapore MOH released a press statement on 9 May 2019, providing information about the situation, advice for the public, and measures being taken to minimize the risk of any potential onward transmission of the disease.WHO risk assessmentMonkeypox is a sylvatic zoonosis with incidental human infections that occur sporadically in parts of Central and West Africa. It is caused by the monkeypox virus (MPXV) and belongs to the Orthopoxvirus family. The disease is self-limiting, with symptoms usually resolving spontaneously within 14-21 days. There is currently no vaccine specifically for monkeypox. The animal reservoir remains unknown, although it is likely to include rodents. Direct contact with affected live or dead animals through hunting and consumption of bush meat are presumed drivers of human infection.This is the first diagnosed case of monkeypox infection in Singapore. The patient was a traveller arriving from Nigeria, where a multistate monkeypox outbreak has been ongoing since September 2017.Given that authorities in Singapore have promptly initiated appropriate public health measures, including isolation of the primary case, contact tracing and quarantine, surveillance and risk communication, the risk of onward spread in the country is low. WHO adviceResidents and travelers to endemic areas/countries should avoid contact with sick, dead or live animals that could harbor MPXV (rodents, marsupials, and primates) and should refrain from eating or handling bush meat. Hand hygiene using soap and water, or alcohol-based sanitizer should be emphasized. Any illness during travel or upon return should be reported to a health professional, including information about all recent travel and immunization history. There is no specific treatment or vaccine for the MPXV infection.Timely contact tracing, surveillance measures and raising awareness of imported emerging diseases among health care providers are essential to prevent secondary cases and effectively manage monkeypox cases and outbreaks.Health-care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed MPXV infection should implement standard, contact and droplet infection control precautions. Samples taken from people and animals with suspected MPXV infection should be handled by trained staff working in suitably equipped laboratories.WHO does not recommend any restriction for travel to, or trade with, Singapore or Nigeria based on available information at this time.For more information on Monkeypox:WHO factsheet on monkeypox, 6 June 2018 WHO disease outbreak news, monkeypox, Nigeria, 21 December  Weekly epidemiological record (WER) no.11, 16 March 2018, Emergence of monkeypox in West Africa and Central Africa 1970-2017 Nigeria CDC, An Update of Monkeypox Outbreak in Nigeria MOH Singapore press release",

        "Description of the Situation": "16 May 2019\n\n \nAlthough the security situation has subsided mildly into an unpredictable calm, the transmission of Ebola virus disease (EVD) continues to intensify in North Kivu and Ituri provinces with more than 100 confirmed cases reported this week.\n\nThe main drivers behind the continued rise in cases stems from insecurity hampering access to critical hotspot areas, persistent pockets of poor community acceptance and hesitation to participate in response activities, and delayed detection and late presentation of EVD cases to Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs)/Transit Centres (TCs). \n\nOf particular concern are the community deaths resulting from the culmination of these factors. Community deaths denote all EVD (confirmed and probable) cases who died outside of an ETC/TC. This includes cases who die at home, as well as those who die within public/private hospitals and other health centres. On average, community deaths comprise approximately 40% of cases reported each week. This proportion fluctuates on a weekly basis, ranging from 28% to 43% of cases since the beginning of April after peaking as high as 71% in February. Of the total deaths (1147) currently listed in surveillance systems, approximately two thirds (68%) occurred outside of ETCs. Many of the patients who arrive at ETCs, often do so in a severe condition with a poor prognosis, and subsequently die shortly after admission. Community deaths also pose a major transmission risk as these cases have spent more time in the community while symptomatic and remain highly infectious at the time of their death and thereafter; propagating EVD to other members of the community such as family members and healthcare workers.\n\nDespite the continued increase in EVD cases, it should be noted that transmission remains most intense in seven main hotspot areas: Katwa, Mabalako, Mandima, Butembo, Musienene, Kalunguta, and Beni. Collectively, these health zones account for the vast majority (93%) of the 350 cases reported in the last 21 days between 24 April \u2013 14 May 2019 (Figure 1 and Table 1). A new case was also reported in the health zone of Alimbongo this week with links to cases deriving from Katwa. Current transmission patterns also illustrate the challenges resulting from cases originating from hotpot health zones and re-introducing the virus to areas where transmissions have previously been successfully halted. During this period, new cases were reported from 91 health areas within 18 of the 22 health zones affected to date (Figure 2). \n\nAs of 14 May, a total of 1739 confirmed and probable EVD cases have been reported, of which 1147 died (case fatality ratio 66%). Of the total cases with recorded sex and age, 56% (974) were female and 30% (514) were children aged less than 18 years. The number of healthcare workers affected has risen to 102 (6% of total cases). Of the EVD patients who received care at ETCs, 459 have been successfully discharged.\n\nRisk communication and community engagement teams continue to spread messages about the importance of seeking care early at healthcare facilities for an increased chance of survival. These messages have been particularly effective in Beni, where affected individuals have been reporting to the ETCs more frequently and more rapidly after onset of symptoms. The risk communication and community engagement actors have been instrumental in mediating instances of reluctance and resistance at the community level to ensure peaceful agreements are reached and that other pillars of the response such as vaccination, infection prevention and control (IPC), and safe and dignified burials (SDB) are able to carry out their respective response activities.\n\nIt is anticipated that the rising case figures will continue within the hotspot areas in the coming weeks given the resumption of most major response activities, which will lead to the detection of more cases. The increased transmission rates witnessed recently continue to demonstrate a heightened risk of EVD spreading to other neighbouring provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and to surrounding countries. \nFigure 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by week of illness onset by health zone.

However, recent community dialogue, outreach initiatives, and restoration of access to certain hotspot areas have resulted in some improvements in community acceptance of response activities and case investigation efforts. Renewed efforts and honing of security mitigation measures, addressing procedural, operational and physical security means to ensure staff safety and security are undertaken. The high proportion of community deaths reported among confirmed cases, relatively low proportion of new cases who were known contacts under surveillance, existence of transmission chains linked to nosocomial infection, persistent delays in detection and isolation in ETCs, and challenges in the timely reporting and response to probable cases, are all factors increasing the likelihood of further chains of transmission in affected communities and increasing the risk of geographical spread both within the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to neighbouring countries.

        "Location": "Mayotte (France)",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 4 January 2019, the National IHR Focal Point for France informed WHO of five human autochthonous cases of Rift Valley Fever (RVF) diagnosed on Mayotte Island through the Early Warning and Response System of the European Union. The dates of symptom onset ranged from 22 November to 31 December 2018.From November 2018 to 03 May 2019, 129 confirmed human Rift Valley Fever (RVF) cases and 109 animal foci (23 small ruminants and 86 bovine) have been reported in Mayotte. After a steady decline in cases during the last three weeks of March 2019, a slight increase has been observed in April 2019. As of 3 May 2019, one new human case but no new animal foci have been reported. Both human RVF cases and animal foci are mainly located in the center and the north west of the main island Grande-Terre. However, since the end of March 2019, a few new animal foci have also been detected in the east of Grande-Terre and in Petite Terre of Mayotte.Public Health ResponseThe following actions have been taken since the detection of the human cases in January 2019:Enhanced surveillance of both human and animal health has been implemented by the local health authorities.Meetings between human and animal health experts have been held locally and at national level for disease information exchange.Local health authorities supply regular communications to breeders and the population to remind them about the importance of personal protective measures against mosquito bites, and avoiding consuming raw meat and milk for infection prevention.Raising awareness among health workers to rapidly diagnose cases.Commercialization of raw milk has been forbidden since 27 February 2019.Exportation of cattle and raw meat and milk from Mayotte is also forbidden since 20 March 2019.WHO risk assessment RVF virus has been circulating actively on the island of Mayotte, in a context of regular import of the virus from nearby countries through illegal animal movements, the presence of susceptible animals and a favorable environment for mosquito vectors to maintain virus transmission locally. RVF virus is primarily transmitted by mosquitoes mainly belonging to the Aedes and Culex genera (but also Anopheles, Mansonia and other mosquito species) among animals. Mayotte, has a notable species richness of mosquitoes with 45 documented species belonging to 15 genera including Aedes and Culex which act as reservoirs of RVF virus. The risk of mosquito borne infections in animals should decrease in the coming months as the rainy season (December to April) in Mayotte is over. However, prolonged rain linked to post-cyclone Kenneth may lead to an increase in RVF cases.While the main route of infection of humans is through direct or indirect contact with the blood, body fluids, tissues and organs of infected animals and aborted animal fetuses, it is highly contagious for humans when handling infected livestock. The high-risk groups including veterinarians, livestock farmers and butchers should conduct safe animal husbandry and slaughtering practices to prevent infections. To date, no human-to-human transmission of RVF virus has been reported.The RVF epizootic can cause agricultural impact and economic losses to communities due to high mortality and abortion rates among infected livestock, loss of public trust in safety of animal products (milk, meat) or bans of movement that might be put in place to control this outbreak. Local authorities have implemented appropriate control measures and strengthened the multisectoral One Health approach to prevent, detect and respond to the RVF outbreak. Nevertheless, there are concerns about a potential increase of cases and foci in May 2019, because of the Ramadan period where an increase of illegal cattle importations is expected. To date, there is no information suggesting the disease will spread beyond Mayotte.WHO adviceRVF is a viral zoonosis that primarily affects domestic animals (including cattle, sheep, camels and goats) and to a lesser extent human. The RVF virus is highly contagious for humans when handling potentially-infected livestock. Raising awareness of the risk factors of RVF transmission as well as protective measures such as vector control and protection against mosquito bites is the key to reduce human infection and deaths. Public health messages for risk reduction should focus on:Reducing the risk of animal-to-human transmission because of unsafe animal husbandry and slaughtering practices. Practicing hand hygiene, wearing gloves and other appropriate individual protective equipment when handling sick animals or their tissues or when slaughtering animals.Reducing the risk of animal-to-human transmission arising from the unsafe consumption of fresh blood, raw milk or animal tissue by thoroughly cooking before eating.The importance of personal and community protection against mosquito bites by using impregnated mosquito nets, personal insect repellent if available, light-colored clothing (long-sleeved shirts and trousers) and by avoiding outdoor activities at peak biting times of the vector species.As outbreaks of RVF in animals precede human cases, the establishment of an active animal health surveillance system is essential in providing early warning for veterinary and human public health authorities. Routine animal immunization in endemic areas can prevent RVF epizootics. Vaccination campaigns are not recommended during an outbreak as it may intensify transmission among the herd through needle propagation of the virus.WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel to, and trade with Mayotte based on the current information available on this event.For more information on Rift Valley fever, please see the links below:Rift Valley Fever, WHO Fact sheet Recognizing Rift Valley Fever, FAO Animal Health Manual No.17  Rift Valley Fever in Mayotte: update on 26 April 2019 Rift Valley Fever, Mayotte, 2007\u20132008 Rapid Risk Assessment, Rift Valley fever outbreak in Mayotte, France, 7 March 2019 Survey of the Mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) of Mayotte",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "From 1 January through 30 April 2019, the Ministry of Health in Tunisia responded to a large measles outbreak in the country. A total of 3 141 suspected cases, of which 909 (28.9%) were laboratory confirmed and 1 236 (39.4 %) epidemiologically linked cases including 30 deaths (case fatality ratio=1.0 %), have been reported in all of the 24 governorates (range 1 \u2013 1 274).",
        "Description of the Situation": "From 1 January through 30 April 2019, the Ministry of Health in Tunisia responded to a large measles outbreak in the country. A total of 3 141 suspected cases, of which 909 (28.9%) were laboratory confirmed and 1 236 (39.4 %) epidemiologically linked cases including 30 deaths (case fatality ratio=1.0 %), have been reported in all of the 24 governorates (range 1 \u2013 1 274). The majority of cases were reported from Kasserine (1 274 cases) and Sfax (212 cases) governorates. In April 2019, four additional governorates were particularly affected with 155, 116, 93 and 69 cases reported from Kairouan, Tunis, Sousse and Nabeul respectively.\n\n\nThe two most affected age groups were those older than 15 years (31%) and infants between the age of 6 and 12 months (28%). The male: female ratio was 1.2. Eighty four percent of affected children between 1 and 5 years were not vaccinated. Death was reported in 30 cases ranging in age from 15 days to 41 years of age (median, 7.5 months).\n\nTo date, the number of reported measles cases is above the average annual number (12 cases) registered in the past 10 years in the country, with the highest number (48 cases) reported in 2012. \n\nIn 2013, Tunisia changed its immunization strategy and introduced the first dose of measles-containing-vaccine at the age of 12 months instead of 9 months (Fig. 1). \nFig. 1: Distribution of measles cases in relation to the change in immunization strategy.

        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "The Ministry of Health (MoH) in Tunisia is coordinating the response activities, with the support of WHO and other partners. Public health response measures include:\n\nIsolation of all reported cases and rapid initiation of epidemiological investigation including contact tracing.\nMeasures to reduce transmission (isolation of patients, limit hospitalization, and personal protective equipment) at hospitals.\nVaccination of unvaccinated children older than 6 months hospitalized in the pediatric hospital.\nVaccination of hospital staff (nurses and paramedics) in the pediatric hospital.\nVaccination of infants aged 6-11 months in all governorates.\nEnhancement of active surveillance, identification of measles vaccine dropouts in the affected governorates and their provision with the vaccine.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Despite the increase in number of measles cases in 2019, the risk at the national level is still moderate due to the immediate government response (vaccination of all 6 to 11 months old infants, nationwide). In addition, the country has had high levels of measles-containing-vaccine second dose (MCV2) immunization coverage (>95%) since 2012, which should help protect many birth cohorts from disease.\nA total of seven Tunisian governorates have a border with Algeria. Despite the absence of official number for people crossing the border, it is known that many families move freely between the two countries, which induces a moderate risk at regional level, whereas the risk at global level remains low.",
        "WHO Advice": "Measles is a highly contagious viral disease which affects susceptible individuals of all ages and remains one of the leading causes of death among young children globally, despite the availability of safe and effective measles-containing vaccines. It is transmitted via droplets from the nose, mouth, or throat of infected persons. Initial symptoms, which usually appear 10\u201312 days after infection, include high fever, usually accompanied by one or several of the following: runny nose, conjunctivitis, cough and tiny white spots on the inside of the mouth. Several days later, a rash develops, starting on the face and upper neck and gradually spreads downwards. A patient is infectious 4 days before the start of the rash to 4 days after the appearance of the rash. Most people recover within 2\u20133 weeks.\nWhile there is no specific antiviral treatment for measles, the provision of vitamin A is recommended by WHO for all children infected with measles, as it is associated with reduced mortality and severity of complications. In populations with high levels of malnutrition and a lack of adequate health care, up to 10% of measles cases result in death and in most vulnerable groups deaths can reach up to 30%. Among malnourished children and people with greater susceptibility, measles can also cause serious complications, including blindness, encephalitis, severe diarrhea, ear infection, and pneumonia.\nIn countries with low vaccination coverage, epidemics typically occur every two to three years and usually last between two and three months, although their duration varies according to population size, crowding, and the population\u2019s immunity status.\nImmunization is the only effective preventive measure against measles. Two doses of measles-rubella (MR) are recommended to ensure immunity.\nWHO urges all member states to:\n\nVaccinate to maintain high coverage (\u2265 95%) with two doses of MCV, in every district\nVaccinate at-risk populations (without proof of vaccination or immunity against measles and rubella), such as healthcare workers, people working in tourism and transportation, and international travelers\nMaintain a reserve of MCV for control of imported cases in each country in the region\nStrengthen epidemiological surveillance of fever or rash cases for timely detection of all suspected cases of measles in public and private healthcare facilities and ensure that samples are received by laboratories within five days of being taken\nProvide a rapid response to imported measles cases through the activation of rapid response teams to prevent the establishment or re-establishment of endemic transmission\nAdminister vitamin A supplementation to all children diagnosed with measles to reduce the complications and mortality (two doses of 50,000 IU for a child less than 6 month of age, 1,00,000 IU for children between 6 and 12 months of age and 200,000 IU for children 12-59 months, immediately upon diagnosis and on the following day).\n\nWHO does not recommend any restriction on travel to, and trade with Tunisia based on the available information from the current outbreak.\n\nWHO Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals- Measles\nWHO Measles and Rubella Surveillance Data",

        "Date Reported": "9 May 2019",
        "Location": "Democratic Republic of the Congo",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak response this past week continues to be hampered by insecurity. On 3 May in Katwa, a Safe and Dignified Burial (SDB) team was violently attacked following the completion of a burial for a deceased EVD case.",
        "Description of the Situation": "The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak response this past week continues to be hampered by insecurity. On 3 May in Katwa, a Safe and Dignified Burial (SDB) team was violently attacked following the completion of a burial for a deceased EVD case. In Butembo and surrounding health zones, response activities were repeatedly halted due to a number of serious security incidents taking place from 4-6 May. On 8 May, a group of over 50 armed militia infiltrated the city centre. Security forces repelled the attack following intense gunfire in close proximity to staff accommodations. Although activities resumed on 9 May, after almost five consecutive days of suspension, threats of further attacks against EVD response teams and facilities remain prevalent.\n\n\nThese security incidents, and especially the resultant lack of access to EVD affected communities, remain a major impediment to the response, with teams unable to perform robust surveillance nor deliver much needed treatment and immunisations. The ongoing violent attacks sow fear, perpetuate mistrust, and further compound the multitude of challenges already faced by frontline healthcare workers. Without commitment from all groups to cease these attacks, it is unlikely that this EVD outbreak can remain successfully contained in North Kivu and Ituri provinces.\n\nEVD transmission remains most intense in Katwa, Butembo, Mandima, Mabalako, Musienene, Beni and Kalunguta hotspot health zones, which collectively account for the vast majority (93%) of the 303 cases reported in the last 21 days between 17 April \u2013 7 May 2019 (Figure 1 and Table 1). During this period, new cases were reported from 78 health areas within 15 of the 21 health zones affected to date (Figure 2). It is expected that the resumption of response activities will bring a substantial increase in the number of cases reported in the coming weeks due to the backlog from the disruptions.\n\nAs of 7 May, a total of 1600 confirmed and probable EVD cases have been reported, of which 1069 died (case fatality of 67%). Of the total cases with recorded sex and age, 57% (907) were female and 30% (475) were children aged less than 18 years. The number of healthcare workers affected has risen to 97 (6% of total cases). 442 EVD patients who received care at Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs) have been successfully discharged.\nAdapted vaccination strategies\n\nOn 7 May 2019, the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) issued new vaccination recommendations in light of the increasing number of EVD cases and continued insecurity in this outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (click here for the full recommendations). The panel made recommendations pertaining to adjusting vaccine dosages, expanding vaccine eligibility, ring vaccination operational improvements, and strengthening training of local healthcare workers to aid in the EVD response.\n\nThe rVSV ZEBOV GP vaccine dosage and eligibility criteria have been revised. For high-risk individuals such as contacts and contacts of contacts, the new SAGE recommendations advise the use of 0.5mL of vaccine instead of 1mL. This revised dose has been previously used during the 2015 Ebola \u00e7a Suffit! trial in Guinea, and is expected to provide similar efficacy in this current EVD outbreak. Those at lower risks are now to receive 0.2mL instead. SAGE also recommends expanding the accessibility of the vaccine to more individuals in affected health areas. In addition to high-risk individuals, it is now recommended that individuals who are potential contacts due to their residence in the villages or neighbourhoods with incident cases (i.e. where EVD cases have been reported in the last 21 days) be offered the rVSV ZEBOV GP vaccine. SAGE believes that by expanding vaccine eligibility, this would address some of the requests from communities in affected health areas for the vaccine to be more widely available, foster greater trust, and improve willingness of communities to engage with other EVD response activities. \n\nSAGE advised the implementation of an adaptive operational approach to ring vaccinations, implemented in two main methods: pop-up vaccinations and targeted geographic vaccinations. Pop-up vaccination would be conducted by inviting contacts and contacts of contacts to a previously agreed upon temporary location some distance away from the residence of contacts. In areas where accurate identification of contacts and contacts of contacts is not possible due to insecurity, targeted geographic vaccination of whole villages or quartiers would be administered at a fixed location with security present. Both of these vaccination operational methods have been utilised successfully before, and are expected to make the vaccination process more efficient and secure for both healthcare providers and the patients they are caring for. \n\nSAGE additionally recommends offering an alternative vaccine (other than rVSV-ZEBOV-GP) to those at lower risk within affected health areas or neighbouring areas. WHO has reviewed evidence provided by two vaccine manufacturers, and the adenovirus 26 vectored glycoprotein / MVA-BN (Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN) investigational Ebola vaccine is being considered and evaluated by a coalition led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness (CEPI) and the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. At this time, this vaccine is in the late stages of formal trials and is expected to be deployed to the field in the near future. These efforts are in line with previous SAGE recommendations regarding the need for more studies to assess the efficacy of additional, alternative Ebola vaccines.\n\nSAGE also supported the proposal to introduce alternative individual informed consent forms and follow up procedures which can potentially simplify and expedite both the vaccination and safety follow up processes. Aside from pregnant women who will be actively followed up until delivery or end of pregnancy, and infants 6-12 months of age who will receive a single visit at day 21, all other case follow up will be completed through passive reporting of adverse events via telephone.\n\nIn addition to technical recommendations, WHO and partners are working closely with residents of Ebola-affected communities to empower them to take on greater ownership of the EVD response. Through intensifying training and engagement with local community members, WHO aims to have the majority of vaccination teams comprised of local healthcare providers by the end of the month. Other key elements to transferring ownership of the response to the communities includes fulfilling community requests made in relation to development projects, and ensuring all persons residing in at-risk areas are well-informed about the status of the outbreak, transmission prevention, and availability of care through further mass communication initiatives.\nFigure 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by week of illness onset by health zone.

        "WHO Risk Assessment": "WHO continuously monitors changes to the epidemiological situation and context of the outbreak to ensure that support to the response is adapted to the evolving circumstances. The last assessment concluded that the national and regional risk levels remain very high, while global risk levels remain low. Weekly increases in the number of new cases has been ongoing since late February 2019. A general deterioration of the security situation, and the persistence of pockets of community mistrust exacerbated by political tensions and insecurity, have resulted in recurrent temporary suspension and delays of case investigation and response activities in affected areas, reducing the overall effectiveness of interventions. However, recent community dialogue, outreach initiatives, and restoration of access to certain hotspot areas have resulted in some improvements in community acceptance of response activities and case investigation efforts. The high proportion of community deaths reported among confirmed cases, relatively low proportion of new cases who were known contacts under surveillance, existence of transmission chains linked to nosocomial infection, persistent delays in detection and isolation in ETCs, and challenges in the timely reporting and response to probable cases, are all factors increasing the likelihood of further chains of transmission in affected communities and increasing the risk of geographical spread both within the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to neighbouring countries. The high rates of population movement occurring from outbreak affected areas to other areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and across porous borders to neighbouring countries during periods of heightened insecurity further compounds these risks. Additional risks are posed by the long duration of the current outbreak, fatigue amongst response staff, and ongoing strain on limited resources. Conversely, substantive operational readiness and preparedness activities in a number of neighbouring countries have likely increased capacity to rapidly detect cases and mitigated local spread. However, these efforts must continue to be scaled-up at this time.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for passengers leaving the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.\nFor more information, please see:\n\n\nPress briefing on Ebola, WHO Director-General Dr Tedros\nWHO Director-General reiterates commitment to Ebola response despite another attack\nWHO expresses concern over damage to Ebola treatment facilities in DRC\nSAGE interim recommendations on vaccination against EVD, 20 February 2019\nHighlights from the April 2019 meeting of the IHR Emergency Committee on the EVD outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\nWHO Interim recommendation Ebola vaccines\nEbola response in Democratic Republic of the Congo risks slowdown\nWHO recommendations for international travellers related to the Ebola Virus Disease outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\nEbola virus disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo \u2013 Operational readiness and preparedness in neighbouring countries\nEbola virus disease fact sheet",

        "Description of the Situation": "7 May 2019\n\n \nGlobally, between 2016 and 2017, the number of reported measles cases increased by 31%, while in the WHO Western Pacific Region (WPR), the total number of cases reported decreased by 82% during the same period. However, there was an increase in cases reported in WPR, from 11 118 in 2017 to 26 163 cases in 2018. A resurgence of measles cases has been seen in all WHO Regions. An unusually high number of cases reported from countries and areas of the WPR in 2019 have been reported from: 1) several countries/areas where measles has been eliminated due to importation-related outbreaks; and 2) endemic countries such as the Philippines which has ongoing measles outbreak. In WPR, currently nine countries and areas (Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Hong Kong SAR (China), Japan, Macao SAR (China), New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, and Singapore) are verified by the Regional Verification Commission for Measles Elimination as having interrupted endemic measles virus transmission for more than 36 months.\n\nTo date, there have been no measles cases reported from the Pacific Island Countries and areas. The majority of countries and areas in WPR have made positive inroads to improve immunization and achieve higher vaccination coverage at the national level. However, with global resurgence of measles and movement of populations, several countries and areas in WPR remain vulnerable to outbreaks of measles due to low coverage of measles-containing-vaccine (MCV), at the subnational level and among vulnerable populations. \n\nThe following is a brief update on the measles situation in WPR from publicly available or information shared by Member States with WPR\nRegional update\nAustralia\n\nFrom 1 January to 12 April 2019, 97 measles cases have been reported nationwide. So far, the number of reported cases is higher than the number of cases reported for the same time period in the last 4 years. The majority of cases in 2019 were imported from countries that have reported cases or outbreaks of measles including Indonesia, Israel, Myanmar, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Viet Nam. For more information, please see here\nChina\n\nIn 2018, 3 940 confirmed measles cases were reported nationally, and the predominant genotype was H1. Although China reported the second highest number of cases in the region following the Philippines in 2018, relative to the population size, the incidence rate remained low at 2.9 per 1 000 000 persons. In January, February and March of 2019, there were 178, 156 and 267 measles cases reported nationwide, respectively. For more information, please see here and here\nHong Kong SAR, China\n\nHong Kong SAR, China achieved measles elimination in 2016 and the annual reported number of measles cases has remained at a low level in the past few years. As of 11 April 2019, the national cumulative number of measles cases is 66. From 4 March 2019, there has been an airport cluster of 29 measles cases, 27 workers from the Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) and two crew members of a local airline. Thirty cases have no obvious epidemiological link identified and the majority have a travel history to; Philippines (8), Mainland China (9, six of which are from Shenzhen, China), Japan (6),Taiwan,China (3), Europe (1), Cambodia (1), Thailand (1), and Viet Nam (1). From next year (2020), children aged 18 months will receive the second vaccination instead of having it when they are six years old under the existing policy. For more information, please see here\nMacao SAR, China\n\nAs of 8 April 2019, 32 measles cases have been reported in Macao SAR, China. Of these, 14 are imported cases, and the rest (18) were locally acquired but epidemiologically linked to imported cases. The 18 locally acquired cases include 10 staff from two hospitals. For more information, please see here\nJapan\n\nOn March 2015, the WHO Western Regional Office verified that Japan had achieved measles elimination. However, from 1 January to 3 April 2019, 378 measles cases have been reported in Japan, the highest number of measles cases recorded during the same time period in a decade. Fifty-six (14.8%) cases were among persons with reported travel history to Philippines (23), Viet Nam (13), Myanmar (5), Hong Kong SAR, China (3), Maldives (2), Sri Lanka (1), New Zealand (1) Malaysia (1), Republic of Korea (1) and Ukraine (1), Cambodia (1), Thailand (1), and an additional two cases with travel to both Maldives and Sri Lanka, and one case with travel to both Thailand and Lao PDR. In comparison, a total of 282 measles cases were reported nationally in 2018. In 2019, 65% of cases were among persons aged between 15 to 39 years, and 256 cases (68%) with no or unknown vaccination history. For more information, please see here\nMalaysia \n\nThe Ministry of Health reported that the number of measles cases in Malaysia increased exponentially from 195 cases in 2013 to 1 934 cases in 2018, an increase of almost 900% over a period of 5 years with six deaths related to measles, of which none were immunized. The number of measles cases among unimmunized persons increased from 125 cases (69%) in 2013 to 1 467 cases (76%) in 2018. From 2016 to 2018, WHO data showed the incidence rate for confirmed measles cases in Malaysia ranged from 50 to 60 per 1 000 000 population. For more information, please see here and here\nNew Zealand\n\nFrom 1 January to 10 April 2019, there have been 72 measles cases with three clusters. Canterbury region has the largest number of infections with 39 cases, followed by Auckland region with 16 cases, Waikato with 12 cases, three in Bay of Plenty and two in Southland. The virus isolated from cases in Canterbury was a B3 genotype, similar to a recent strain from the Philippines. A typed cluster in Waikato was linked to cases reported in November 2018 associated with a travel-related case. Two cases in Bay of Plenty were related to travellers returning from the Philippines and another case was in a person who made multiple stops in Japan and Singapore. The majority of cases have occurred in adolescents and young adults aged between 10 to 29 years. In 2018, a total of 30 cases were reported nationally. New Zealand achieved measles elimination in 2017 with a national Immunization coverage of 92% and 89% for first and second dose of measles-containing vaccine, respectively, in 2016. For more information, please see here\nThe Philippines\n\nThe Philippines experienced an increase in measles cases from late 2017. In February 2019, the Department of Health (DoH) officially declared a measles outbreak in five regions: National Capital Region (NCR) (which is Metro Manila), Regions IVA, III, VI and VII. While an outbreak was declared in five regions, measles cases were reported from all regions. Nationally, from 1 January to 30 March 2019, there have been 25 956 measles cases including 381 deaths reported (case fatality rate (CFR)= 1.5%), an increase by 378% compared to the same time period in 2018. From 1 January to 30 March 2019, NCR recorded the highest number of measles cases with 5 586 including 104 deaths (CFR= 2%) followed by region IVA with 5 281 cases including 104 deaths (CFR= 2%). The majority of measles cases were among persons who were unvaccinated (59%) and under five years of age (53%). The Philippines has had persistent low immunization coverage over the past few years, from above 80% in 2008 to below 70% in 2017. According to World Health Organization (WHO) estimates, 2.6 million Filipino children under the age of 5 years are not protected from measles, with 80% coming from 7 out of 17 regions. Chronic low routine immunization coverage and vaccination hesitancy is broadly agreed as the root cause for this outbreak. For more information, please see here\nRepublic of Korea\n\nFrom 17 December 2018 to 22 April 2019, 150 measles cases have been reported, including eight clusters associated with imported cases. Confirmed cases with recent overseas travel visited the following countries: Viet Nam (16), Philippines (10), Thailand (2), Ukraine (2), Europe (1), Taiwan, China (1), Madagascar (1), Cambodia (1), Uzbekistan (1) and Kyrgyzstan (1). For more information, please see here\nPublic health response\n\nWHO is working with Member States and partners to:\n\nDetect measles cases early and prevent avoidable deaths through case management \nInvestigate, guide response to, and mobilize funds for ongoing measles outbreaks\nDevelop risk communication plans and mobilize communities\nStrengthen outbreak preparedness \nStrengthen overall immunization systems and improve routine vaccination coverage\nPlan and implement preventive supplemental immunization campaigns to increase population immunity \nStrengthen laboratory-supported measles surveillance\nDevelop national action plans for measles elimination\nMonitor progress towards and verify achievement of measles elimination through the Regional Verification Commission for Measles and Rubella Elimination\nProduce Regional guidance for preparedness for and response to measles and rubella outbreaks.\n\nWHO risk assessment\n\nMeasles is a highly contagious viral disease and remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among young children globally, despite the availability of a safe and effective vaccine. Globally, there has been an increasing trend of measles cases reported across all regions, with outbreaks in countries that had previously achieved elimination status. Furthermore, the resurgence of endemic measles has occurred despite high national immunization coverage in some countries. This reflects the risk that measles virus can spread when there is variability in immunization coverage at the district and local levels, or gaps in population immunity among sub-populations. Infants too young to be vaccinated are at highest risk of measles; however, infants and those with medical contraindications to measles vaccination can be protected through herd (population) immunity when immunization coverage rates (> 95%) are high. Infants, populations with poor access to health care services, and comorbidities such as malnutrition, including Vitamin A deficiency are vulnerable to infection and at higher risk for severe disease after infection.\n\nGiven the variable immunization coverage and capacity for detection and response, the risk of continued transmission remains, and there is ongoing possibility of further spread internationally. Countries experiencing regular movement of tourists or overseas workers, in particular those travelling to or from measles-affected countries, are at risk for introduction of measles; countries with low level of immunization coverage (< 95%) at the district and local level are also vulnerable to outbreaks.\n\nThe recent outbreaks have been fuelled by: 1) low immunization coverage due to gaps in routine immunization programs; 2) low immunization coverage among subpopulations; 3) movement of people domestically and internationally, and; 4) vaccine hesitancy.\nWHO advice\n\nMeasles has a long incubation period with the average time from exposure to onset of early symptoms of about 10 - 12 days, and from exposure to rash onset an average of 14 days (range 7- 21 days), which means that international travel can be completed before an infected traveller becomes symptomatic. Case patients may be infectious from approximately 3 days prior to the onset of the rash to 4 days after the rash erupts.\n\nWith ongoing measles outbreaks in all regions, the WHO Regional Office for the WPR urges Member States to refer to and implement the following published WHO guidance, which provides specific recommendations to strengthen preparedness and response to measles outbreaks, including detailed procedures for effective surveillance and investigation of acute rash and fever cases, which enable rapid detection and containment of imported cases of measles:\n\nWPRO Measles Elimination Field Guide (2013)1 [pp. 25\u201433, 38\u201452]; and Regional Strategy and Plan of Action for Measles and Rubella Elimination in the Western Pacific (2018)2 [pp. 72\u201476]. In particular, all countries in the WPR - regardless of country context or whether they have achieved elimination of endemic measles transmission or are currently experiencing an ongoing outbreak - should urgently take the following actions:\n\nIntensify surveillance for acute rash and fever to ensure measles cases are rapidly detected, confirmed and linked to rapid public health action.\n\nIntensify messaging for clinicians to notify all acute rash and fever cases to the vaccine-preventable disease (VPD) surveillance system, regardless of clinical suspicion and to be particularly attentive to whether patients have travelled internationally or have been in contact with international travellers in the preceding 21 days.\nEnsure that protocols and procedures for reporting, sample collection, rapid laboratory testing for case confirmation and genotyping, and epidemiological linkage for case confirmation are updated and reinforced among stakeholders.\nAnalyse and provide regular and timely feedback of surveillance data to healthcare facilities and subnational public health officials (e.g. updates on suspected case counts nationally and at the subnational level).\n\nEnsure contingency resources for human resources, available vaccine stock, and operational funds are inventoried, and accessible to support rapid outbreak investigation and response immunization if measles cases are detected\nIdentify coordination and leadership structures, mechanisms for rapid response team activation and lines of communication between local level, sub national and national level. \nUpdate and inform clinicians on immunization schedules (including criteria for providing \u201czero-dose\u201d to infants older than 6 months, if applicable) and guidelines for immunization of travellers to measles-affected countries; case management protocols; and infection prevention and control procedures to prevent nosocomial measles spread.\nUpdate and inform the public on the risk of measles and how the disease can be prevented. WHO\u2019s Guide to Tailoring Immunization Programmes3 provides some useful strategies to increase uptake of childhood vaccines if tailored and adjusted to the local context and changing situation. \n\n\nWHO has not made a recommendation towards compulsory vaccination, travel restrictions, or border screening for measles. It is up to countries to decide how best to ensure their population is immunized to protect individuals and communities from disease. Signage about measles at air and sea ports, including on how to seek health care if measles is suspected, is a useful adjunct to raising measles awareness in the community. People planning international travel should ensure they have been vaccinated against measles because of the high risk of exposure to the measles virus from fellow travellers and in many countries in the world where measles is currently spreading.\n\n\nThe current global resurgence of measles is an urgent signal for countries to renew focus on implementing the strategies, activities, and procedures detailed in the \u201cMeasles Elimination Field Guide\u201d1 and the \u201cRegional Strategy and Plan of Action\u201d2 to achieve sufficient population immunity to reduce the risk of outbreaks and prevent sustained endemic measles transmission. \n\n\nMeasles vaccines: WHO position paper (April 2017) \n\nMeasles Fact Sheet \n\nWPRO Measles-Rubella Bulletin 2019 \n\n\n\n\n1Measles Elimination Field Guide (WPR, 2013)\n\n\n2Regional Strategy and Plan of Action for Measles and Rubella Elimination in the Western Pacific (WPR, 2018)\n\n3The Guide to Tailoring Immunization Programmes (EURO, 2013)",

        "Description of the Situation": "In the first two months of 2019, 34 300 measles cases have been reported in 42 countries of the WHO European Region, including 13 measles-related deaths in three countries (Albania, Romania and Ukraine). The majority of cases are reported in Ukraine, with more than 25 000 cases (>70%)1.\n\n\nAs of 28 March 2019, the WHO European Region reported a total of 83 540 measles cases and 74 related deaths for 2018. This is compared to 25 869 cases and 42 deaths in 2017, and 5 273 cases and 13 deaths in 2016. In 2018, eight countries reported over 2 000 cases each including Ukraine (n= 53 218), Serbia (n=5 076), Israel (3 140), France (n=2 913), Italy, (n=2 686), Russian Federation (n=2 256), Georgia (n=2 203) and Greece (n=2 193).\n\nAlthough the European Region achieved its highest ever estimated coverage for the second dose of measles vaccination in 2017 (90%), countries with measles outbreaks have experienced a range of challenges in recent years including a decline or stagnation in overall routine immunization coverage in some cases, low coverage at subnational level or among some marginalized groups and immunity gaps in older populations. Most cases are occurring in unvaccinated or under-vaccinated individuals.\nFig. 1: Monthly distribution and classification of measles cases, January 2017\u2013 February 20191, WHO European Region\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nEnlarge image\n\n\n\nAccording to the most recent report from the European Regional Verification Commission for Measles and Rubella Elimination (RVC), based on 2017 data, measles elimination has been verified in 37 (out of the 53) countries in the WHO European Region, which documented interrupted transmission for at least 36 months. Five countries provided evidence for the interruption of measles transmission for a period of at least 24 months but less than 36 months, and one for interruption for transmission for 12 months. Ten countries including Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, France, Georgia, Germany, Italy, Romania, Russian Federation, Serbia and Ukraine remain endemic for measles. The RVC will meet in June 2019 to review reports from National Verification Committees (NVCs) for measles and rubella elimination documenting each country\u2019s status by the end of 2018. All countries reporting measles cases continuously for 12 months or more will have to provide a detailed epidemiological and molecular epidemiology (measles virus genotypes and lineages) analysis to document absence of continuous measles transmission or re-established endemic transmission. \n1Numbers for 2016-2019 are based on monthly surveillance data received by WHO as of 28 March 2019. These data are reported in the WHO EpiData series and subject to change as new updates from countries are received.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "The European Vaccine Action Plan 2015\u20132020 (EVAP) states that at least 95% of individuals in every population needs to be immune, through two doses of vaccination or prior exposure to the virus, to ensure community protection for everyone \u2013 including babies too young to be vaccinated and others who cannot be immunized due to existing diseases and medical conditions. The EVAP was adopted unanimously by all 53 Member States in the European Region at the 64th session of the WHO Regional Committee for Europe on 18 September 2014.\nThe WHO Regional Office for Europe continues to work with countries in the Region to enhance their immunization and disease surveillance systems. This includes building capacities and providing guidance to:\n\nEnsure that all population groups have equitable access to vaccination services and that these are convenient\nIdentify who has been missed in the past and reach them with the vaccines they need\nEnsure that health workers are vaccinated to prevent transmission in health facilities, and that they have sufficient technical knowledge about vaccines and the immune system to feel confident in recommending vaccination to their patients\nStrengthen public trust in vaccines and health authorities\nSecure access to a timely and affordable supply of vaccines\nImprove outbreak detection and response\nListen and respond to people\u2019s concerns and respond to any health event that could be potentially related to vaccine safety.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Measles is a highly contagious viral disease. It remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among young children globally, despite the availability of a safe and effective vaccine. Transmission from person-to-person is airborne, as well as by direct or indirect contact of secretions (nasal, throat) of an infected person. The virus can cause widespread outbreaks in the presence of large numbers of susceptible persons.\nEven with implementation of outbreak response measures, measles continues to circulate in the European Region as a result of suboptimal vaccination coverage and population immunity gaps. If outbreak response is not timely and comprehensive, the virus will find its way into more pockets of vulnerable individuals and potentially spread to additional countries within and beyond the Region. It is proportional to the size of the population that remains susceptible to measles. Measles has also been reported among health workers and nosocomial transmission has contributed to some outbreaks.\nThe impact on public health will persist until the ongoing outbreaks are controlled, routine immunization coverage is continuously high (\u2265 95%) and immunity gaps in the population closed. As long as measles continues to circulate anywhere in the world, no country can avoid importation, but they can protect their populations through high routine and supplemental immunization coverage of susceptible individuals.",
        "WHO Advice": "Initial symptoms of measles, which usually appear 10-12 days after infection, include high fever, runny nose, red eyes, cough, and tiny white spots on the inside of the mouth. A few days later, a rash develops, starting on the face and upper neck and gradually spreading downwards. A patient is usually infectious 4 days before the start of the rash to 4 days after the appearance of the rash.\nThere is no specific antiviral treatment for measles. Vaccination is the only way to prevent the disease. High vaccination coverage of at least 95% with two doses of measles vaccines in all population groups and age cohorts at national level and in all districts is crucial to elimination.\nCountries need to identify susceptible individuals and population groups and consider undertaking catch-up immunization or supplementary immunization activities to close immunity gaps. Tailored strategies to reach older populations and marginalized groups may be required.\nEvery opportunity should be used to vaccinate susceptible children, adolescents and adults. Measles-containing vaccines should also be recommended for susceptible persons intending to travel to countries where measles is endemic and where outbreaks are ongoing.\nTo protect health workers, prevent nosocomial infections and limit transmission of these diseases, health workers should be vaccinated. This includes those with an uncertain vaccination status and no or unknown history of disease.\nElimination of measles is a priority goal that all European countries have firmly committed to. In adopting the EVAP 2015\u20132020, all 53 Member States of the Region committed to eliminating measles and rubella as one of the Region\u2019s priority immunization goals. The cornerstones for eliminating measles remain high population immunity to stop disease transmission and high-quality surveillance to monitor disease occurrence for public health action.",

        "Description of the Situation": "1 May 2019\n\n \nOn 9 February 2019, the government of Congo officially declared an outbreak of chikungunya virus disease.\n\nThe outbreak was detected following an increase in the number of patients presenting to several health facilities with signs and symptoms of sudden onset of fever, joint pain and muscle pain and a subsequent laboratory confirmation of 12 samples in the National Institute of Biomedical Research (INRB) in Kinshasa. The first suspected case was a symptomatic 49-year-old woman who presented on 7 January 2019 to a health facility in Diosso town, 25 kilometres north of Pointe-Noire. Samples taken during a joint investigation of the Ministry of Health (MoH) and WHO tested positive to chikungunya on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at INRB in Kinsasha.\n\nFrom 1 January to 14 April 2019, a total of 6,149 suspected cases of chikungunya have been reported in the country with approximately 54% of reported cases being female. One hundred and seventy-three blood samples have been collected with 61 (35.3%) testing positive by PCR at INRB. However, the scale of this outbreak has likely been underestimated given the limited detection capacity of the surveillance system in the country. Several mosquito breeding sites in affected areas and inadequate vector control mechanisms also represent major contributing factors for the outbreak.\n\nThe Ministry of Health has reported that the outbreak has spread to eight of twelve health departments in the country (Kouilou, Bouenza, Pointe Noire, Plateaux, Pool, Niari, L\u00e9koumou and Brazzaville). Since the report of the first case on 7 January 2019, 47% of all cases have been reported from Kouilou Department. No deaths have been reported. This is the second outbreak reported in Congo since 2011 and no seasonal pattern has previously been observed.\nPublic health response \n\nThe Ministry of Health is coordinating the development and adoption of response and communication plans at the health department level.\nWHO is supporting the Ministry of Health to adapt existing protocols for the management of chikungunya cases.\nEpidemiological surveillance is being strengthened using the Early Warning, Alert and Response System (EWARS). \nThe Ministry of Health in collaboration with WHO is undertaking an entomological survey to provide a better understanding of the characteristics of vectors.\nVector control activities have commenced in many affected health districts including indoor residual spraying and eliminating mosquito breeding sites through source reduction.\nRegular health promotion messages are being delivered on local television and radio channels. \n\nWHO risk assessment\n\nBased on available information, the risk of continued transmission and spread of chikungunya to unaffected areas cannot be ruled out. The overall risk is considered moderate at both the national and regional levels. \n\nGeographic spread of the vector and human cases is likely due to the high number of cases reported in several health departments, the presence of Aedes vectors in many parts of the country, ubiquity of breeding sites in and around living areas and poor coordination of response activities including vector control complicated by the ongoing rainy season. Strengthened disease surveillance will help inform the implementation of appropriate public health actions to control the outbreak.\n\nThe WHO Regional Office is mobilizing financial and technical resources to support the ministry of health and WHO country office in controlling the ongoing outbreak and is prepared to support neighbouring countries if the outbreak spreads beyond Congo. The overall risk at global level is low.\nWHO advice\n\nReducing the number of natural and artificial breeding sites for mosquitoes has a significant impact on the prevention and control of chikungunya outbreaks. This requires affected communities to be mobilized to institute control measures including covering of water collection containers, proper waste disposal and improved environmental sanitation. During outbreaks, insecticides may be used to kill adult mosquitoes and immature larvae. \n\nClothing which minimizes the exposure of skin during the day is advised during outbreaks as vectors are known to bite in daylight. Repellents can be applied to exposed skin or to clothing in strict accordance with product label instructions. Repellents should contain DEET (N, N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide), IR3535 (3-[N-acetyl-N-butyl]-aminopropionic acid ethyl ester) or icaridin (1-piperidinecarboxylic acid, 2-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-methylpropylester). \n\nBasic precautions should be taken by people travelling to Congo including the use of mosquito repellents and wearing of long sleeved clothing. Also, the use of a mosquito bed net or window screens, air conditioning, mosquito coils or other insecticide vaporizers may also reduce indoor biting.\n\nFor more information, please see the link below:\n\n\nWHO fact sheet on Chikungunya",

        "Description of the Situation": "18 April 2019\n\n \nIn Brazil, seasonal increases of yellow fever have historically occurred between December and May. During the 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 seasons, the number of yellow fever cases was much larger than in previous years (Figures 1 & 2). The increase in cases was partly due to a geographical expansion of the areas affected by yellow fever to include areas previously considered risk-free (Figure 3). \n\nIn the current 2018- 2019 season (July 2018 to March 2019), a total of 75 confirmed human cases, including 17 deaths (case fatality rate = 23%), have been reported in Brazil in the states of S\u00e3o Paulo (62), Paran\u00e1 (12), and Santa Catarina (1). Of these cases, 88% (66/75) are males, the median age is 43 years, and 71% (53/75) are rural workers.\n\nIn the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, the municipalities that reported confirmed cases are: Eldorado (16), Iporanga (15), Barra do Turbo (6), Cajati (5), Cananeia (4), Jacupiranga (4), Pariquera-a\u00e7u (4), Juquia (1), Registro (1), Serra Negra (1), Sete Barras (1), Ribeira (1), Vargem (1) and for 2 cases, the municipalities were unknown. In the state of Paran\u00e1, the municipalities with confirmed cases are: Guaraque\u00e7aba (2), Antonina (2), S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Pinhais (2), Morretes (1), Andrin\u00f3polis (3), Paranagu\u00e1 (1) and in 1 case, the municipality is unknown. The state of Santa Catarina reported one fatal confirmed human case of yellow fever. The case is a 36-year-old male, without vaccination, whose municipality is unknown.\n\nLikewise, in the same reporting period of July 2018 to March 2019, 33 confirmed epizootics were reported in five federal states: S\u00e3o Paulo (20), Rio de Janeiro (8), Minas Gerais (1), Mato Grosso (2), and Paran\u00e1 (2). In the four weeks preceding this report, epizootics have been confirmed in S\u00e3o Paulo and Paran\u00e1 states.\nFigure 1. Distribution of confirmed human yellow fever cases by year.

Distribution of epizootics and confirmed human cases in Brazil from July 2018 to March 2019.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nEnlarge image\n\n\nPublic health response\n\nGiven the geographical expansion in Brazil of the human cases and the epizootic wave in the last two seasonal periods, the country has had to adjust its immunization policies for yellow fever. The number of areas with recommended vaccination has increased from 3,526 municipalities in 2010 to 4,469 municipalities in 2018. \n\nIn line with the World Health Organization guidelines, Brazil has adopted a single dose vaccination scheme for yellow fever since April 2017. The use of fractional doses was also adopted to respond to outbreaks and the risk of urbanization of yellow fever, especially in large cities. This strategy was implemented in response to the 2018 yellow fever outbreak in 77 municipalities with the greatest risk for yellow fever in the states of S\u00e3o Paulo (54 municipalities), Rio de Janeiro (15 municipalities), and Bah\u00eda (8 municipalities). \n\nPrior to the vaccination campaign, the states of Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo had already vaccinated about 13.2 million people. During the campaign, an additional 13.3 million people were vaccinated in S\u00e3o Paulo, 6.5 million in Rio de Janeiro and 1.85 million in Bahia. This resulted in a vaccination coverage of 53.6%, 55.6%, and 55.0% respectively and across all 77 municipalities with the greatest risk of yellow fever1. Furthermore, data from the Brazilian Ministry of Health indicate that vaccination coverage of at least 95% was achieved in 17.8% (71/399) of the municipalities of Paran\u00e1, 23.7% (118/497) of the municipalities of Rio Grande do Sul and 14.9% (44/295) of the municipalities of Santa Catarina.\nWHO risk assessment\n\nFurther transmission is expected in the coming months based on seasonal patterns. Recent human cases of yellow fever during the current seasonal cycle have been reported in S\u00e3o Paulo, Paran\u00e1, and Santa Catarina states in Southeast Brazil. \n\nThe preliminary assessment of the vaccination coverage in municipalities from Paran\u00e1, Rio Grande do Sul, S\u00e3o Paulo, and Santa Catarina states suggests a high proportion of persons remaining susceptible and the necessity to intensify communication to encourage greater vaccine uptake among groups at risk.\n\nThe geographical distribution of human cases and epizootics from the current and previous two seasonal cycles (Figure 3) suggests southward movement of the virus, which presents further risk to the states of Paran\u00e1, Rio Grande do Sul, and Santa Catarina. Furthermore, these areas have ecosystems favourable for yellow fever transmission and borders with other countries such as Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay.\n\nDuring the 2017-2018 yellow fever season, human cases of yellow fever acquired in Brazil were reported among travelers, most of whom arrived from countries where the vector is absent (or absent during winter). \n\nTo date, yellow fever transmission by Aedes aegypti has not been documented. An investigation conducted by the Evandro Chagas Institute and reported by the Brazil Ministry of Health revealed the detection of the yellow fever virus in Aedes albopictus mosquitoes captured in rural areas of 2 municipalities in Minas Gerais (Itu\u00eata and Alvarenga) in 2017. The significance of this finding requires further investigation. The last documented outbreak of urban yellow fever in Brazil was recorded in 1942. The sylvatic yellow fever virus is transmitted to monkeys by forest dwelling mosquitoes such as Haemagogus and Sabethes spp. Humans who are exposed to these mosquitoes can become infected if they are not vaccinated. In entomological studies conducted in some of the affected states during the 2016-2017 outbreak, isolated Haemagogus mosquitoes were found to be positive for yellow fever, indicating predominantly sylvatic transmission.\n\nWHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and review the risk assessment based on the latest available information. Currently, based on available information, WHO assesses the overall risk as High at the national level, Moderate at the regional level, and Low at the global level.\nWHO advice\n\nOn 25 January 2019, PAHO/WHO alerted2 Member States about the beginning of the seasonal period for yellow fever and therefore, the highest risk of transmission to unvaccinated humans. Thus, PAHO/WHO advises Member States with areas at-risk for yellow fever to continue efforts to immunize susceptible populations and to take the necessary actions to keep travelers informed and vaccinated prior to traveling to areas where yellow fever vaccination is recommended.\n\nWHO recommends vaccination of international travelers above 9 months of age going to Brazil. The updated areas at-risk for yellow fever transmission and the related recommendations for vaccination of international travelers were updated by WHO on 3 May 20183; the map of revised areas at risk and yellow fever vaccination recommendations is available on the WHO International Travel and Health website: \n\n\nWHO International Travel and Health\n\n\n\nYellow fever can easily be prevented through immunization, if vaccine is administered at least 10 days before travel. A single dose of yellow fever vaccine is sufficient to confer life-long protection against yellow fever infection: a booster dose of the vaccine is not needed and should not be required of international travelers as a condition of entry. The vaccine has been used for many decades and is safe and affordable.\n\nWHO advises against the application of any general travel or trade restrictions to Brazil based on the information available for this event.\nResources\n\nInformation on the yellow fever situation in Brazil and other countries in the Americas is published regularly on the PAHO/WHO website and on the Brazil Ministry of Health website:\n\n\nPAHO: Epidemiological Alerts and Updates \n\n\n\nFebre Amarela: causas, sintomas, diagn\u00f3stico, preven\u00e7\u00e3o e tratamento \n\n\nInformation on the yellow fever situation in S\u00e3o Paulo, Paran\u00e1, and Santa Catarina states are available at:\n\n\nYellow fever in S\u00e3o Paulo \n\nYellow fever in Paran\u00e1 \n\nYellow fever in Santa Catarina  \n\n\n\n\nFor more information on yellow fever, please see:\n\n\nPAHO/WHO yellow fever fact sheet \n\nWHO yellow fever health topics\n\n\nWHO list of countries with vaccination requirements and recommendations for international travellers \n\nWHO yellow fever risk mapping and recommended vaccination for travellers \n\nWHO strategy for yellow fever epidemic preparedness and response\n\n\n\n\n1This data is preliminary and subject to change.\n\n\n2Pan American Health Organization / World Health Organization.

        "Description of the Situation": "The incidence of Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo continued to increase this week; however, it remained confined to a limited geographical area within North Kivu and Ituri provinces. This recent trend is likely attributable, in part, to past and ongoing security issues, unrest amongst certain local populations, and lingering community mistrust towards outbreak response teams. Improved case detection and response activities have been observed in previously inaccessible hotspots.\n\n\nIn the 21 days between 27 March and 16 April 2019, 55 health areas within 11 health zones reported new cases; 39% of the 143 health areas affected to date (Table 1 and Figure 2). During this period, a total of 249 confirmed cases were reported from Katwa (124), Vuhovi (40), Mandima (28), Butembo (24), Beni (16), Oicha (6), Mabalako (5), Kalunguta (2), Masereka (2), Musienene (1), and Lubero (1).\n\nAs of 16 April, a total of 1290 confirmed and probable EVD cases have been reported, of which 833 died (case fatality rate 65%). Of the 1290 cases with reported age and sex, 56% (725) were female, and 28% (361) were children aged less than 18 years. The number of healthcare workers affected has risen to 89 (7% of total cases), including 32 deaths. To date, a total of 379 EVD patients who received care at Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs) have been discharged.\n\nOn 12 April 2019, the International Health Regulation (IHR) Emergency Committee convened in Geneva, Switzerland, to discuss whether the EVD outbreak posed a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and offer response recommendations. While the Emergency Committee and the WHO Director-General reiterated their serious concern at the recent rise in the number of cases and the high risk of regional spread, upon consultation with various technical experts and further review of available epidemiological data, it was concluded that the current outbreak did not constitute a PHEIC. For the complete WHO statement concerning the 12 April IHR Emergency Committee meeting, please see here.\n\nThe ongoing vaccination efforts have produced some promising results this past week. On 12 April 2019, WHO and Institut National de Recherche Biom\u00e9dicale (INRB) published a preliminary analysis concerning the efficacy of the rVSV-ZEBOV-GP vaccine currently utilised in this outbreak (please see full report here). The data suggested the vaccine demonstrated notable efficacy in preventing Ebola infections in vaccinated individuals compared to those who are unvaccinated. Between 2-4 April 2019, the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) convened a meeting to review the epidemiological data and offer further recommendations to the ongoing vaccination efforts. They urged the further expansion of those eligible for vaccination to include children older than 6 months and lactating women; two populations observed to have especially high attack rates and high case fatality rates (please see here for further highlights from the SAGE meeting).\n\nIn light of the findings, WHO and partners are evolving the existing vaccination strategy on the ground. Along with intensifying contact tracing of cases and vaccinating their known immediate contacts, a greater emphasis is being placed on following up contacts of contacts and ensuring these at-risk individuals are adequately vaccinated against Ebola. Various approaches are being employed at this time to vaccinate people at-risk including: \n\nSite-by-site vaccinations at the places of residence and other locations previously visited by cases\nSimultaneous vaccination of healthcare and frontline workers (HCW/FLW), and others at increased risk working in healthcare facilities\nPop-up vaccination, where those at risk are invited to an agreed upon location, outside their place of residence \nTargeted geographic vaccination of villages if contacts, and contacts of contacts, cannot be clearly ascertained due to security constraints, but are invited to a previously agreed upon site to be vaccinated.\n\n\nThrough these strategies, 23 operational vaccination teams have effectively closed previously observed gaps in the vaccination rings surrounding reported cases; rings are currently pending for 10 of the 257 cases confirmed during the period between 28 March to 16 April 2019. As of 16 April, a total of 102 501 contacts and contacts of contacts have been vaccinated, of whom 29 720 were HCWs/FLWs. Outside of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, vaccination of frontline healthcare workers commenced in neighbouring Rwanda on 16 April 2019, with 176 HCWs/FLWs already vaccinated. It is expected that the vaccination strategy will be an effective means to slowing the spread of EVD.\n\nInfection prevention and control (IPC) efforts have also yielded some notable progress this past week. A revised IPC strategy with an operational work plan for February to May 2019 period has been endorsed by the Ministry of Health (MoH). The strategy and work plan are intended to guide the national coordination activities of the Ebola response\u2019s IPC Task Force, and the implementation of activities by the IPC commissions and partners at the subnational level. To support this operational shift, Risk Communication and Community Engagement research initiatives are being developed to better understand transmission pathways that can be addressed by the IPC coordination activities. Additional support will be provided by collecting feedback through community dialogue on how IPC can be better implemented at the community level. \n\nWhile the EVD outbreak remains ongoing and the rise in number of cases is likely to continue in the following weeks, it should be noted that substantial progress has been made to adapt response strategies to the ever-evolving situation. Despite the multitude of challenges posed by having to mount a robust outbreak response in the demanding circumstances in which this EVD outbreak is currently taking place, WHO and partners are continuing to intensify all facets of the response efforts to curtail the further spread of EVD in the North Kivu and Ituri provinces.\nFigure 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by week of illness onset, data as of 16 April 2019*\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n*Data in recent weeks are subject to delays in case confirmation and reporting, as well as ongoing data cleaning.\nFigure 2: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by health area, North Kivu and Ituri provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo, data as of 15 April 2019\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nEnlarge image\n\n\nTable 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases, and number of health areas affected, by health zone, North Kivu and Ituri provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo, data as of 16 April 2019**\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nEnlarge image\n\n\n\n**Total cases and areas affected based during the last 21 days are based on the initial date of case alert, and may differ from date of confirmation and daily reporting by the Ministry of Health",

        "WHO Risk Assessment": "WHO continuously monitors changes to the epidemiological situation and context of the outbreak to ensure that support to the response is adapted to the evolving circumstances. The last assessment concluded that the national and regional risk levels remain very high, while global risk levels remain low. Weekly increases in the number of new cases has been ongoing since late February 2019. A general deterioration of the security situation, and the persistence of pockets of community reluctance, refusal, and resistance due to mistrust exacerbated by political tensions and insecurity, have resulted in recurrent temporary suspension and delays of case investigation and response activities in affected areas, reducing the overall effectiveness of interventions. However, recent community dialogue, outreach initiatives, and restoration of access to certain hotspot areas have resulted in some improvements in community acceptance of response activities and case investigation efforts. The high proportion of community deaths reported among confirmed cases, relatively low proportion of new cases who were known contacts under surveillance, existence of transmission chains linked to nosocomial infection, persistent delays in detection and isolation in ETCs, and challenges in the timely reporting and response to probable cases, are all factors increasing the likelihood of further chains of transmission in affected communities and increasing the risk of geographical spread both within the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to neighbouring countries. The high rates of population movement occurring from outbreak affected areas to other areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and across porous borders to neighbouring countries during periods of heightened insecurity further compounds these risks. Additional risks are posed by the long duration of the current outbreak, fatigue amongst response staff, and ongoing strain on limited resources. Conversely, substantive operational readiness and preparedness activities in a number of neighbouring countries, including vaccination of HCW and FLWs at prioritised health facilities, have likely increased capacity to rapidly detect cases and mitigated local spread; this must continue to be scaled-up.",
        "WHO Advice": "International traffic: WHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for passengers leaving the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

        "Description of the Situation": "11 April 2019\n\n \nThe rise in number of Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases observed in the North Kivu provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo continues this week. During the last 21 days (20 March to 9 April 2019), 57 health areas within 11 health zones reported new cases; 40% of the 141 health areas affected to date (Table 1 and Figure 2). During this period, a total of 207 probable and confirmed cases were reported from Katwa (83), Vuhovi (41), Mandima (29), Beni (21), Butembo (15), Oicha (8), Masereka (4), Lubero (2), Musienene (2), Kalunguta (1), and Mabalako (1).\n\nAs of 9 April, a total of 1186 confirmed and probable EVD cases have been reported, of which 751 died (case fatality ratio 63%). Of the 1186 cases with reported age and sex, 57% (675) were female, and 29% (341) were children aged less than 18 years. The number of healthcare workers affected has risen to 87 (7% of total cases), including 31 deaths. To date, a total of 354 EVD patients who received care at Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs) have been discharged.\n\nWHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has convened the Emergency Committee for a meeting on 12 April, to consider whether the current EVD outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern and to provide recommendations.\n\nProgress on the ground this week focused primarily on intensifying infection prevention and control (IPC) activities in and around outbreak hotspot areas. IPC teams are concentrating their efforts at addressing reluctance to decontamination activities amongst some local residents by actively engaging in regular direct dialogues with community leaders. Along with intensifying decontamination efforts, other IPC measures being undertaken include rapid evaluation of IPC practices in healthcare facilities and patients\u2019 homes and identifying facilities at increased risk of contact with EVD cases. Results from these rapid evaluations demonstrated a range of IPC gaps depending on the type of facility, which were then promptly addressed through supplementary supervision. Reoccurring issues include limited knowledge of standard precautions, lack of triage and isolation capacity, insufficient supplies (e.g., of personal protective equipment), inappropriate waste management, and lack of capacity for decontaminating medical equipment. These findings highlight the importance of maintaining supportive supervision and mentorship at priority facilities throughout the response. WHO is confident that strengthening these IPC measures would be an integral means of slowing the spread of EVD in the outbreak areas.\n\nWHO and partners in Risk Communication and Community Engagement are continuing with activities to build and maintain a trusting relationship between communities and the Ebola response teams. Dialogues with community committees are ongoing in the hotspot areas of Butembo, Katwa, and Vuhovi, and form a key part of a larger increase ownership of the Ebola response by the communities. Information about community disquiet are systematically collected and monitored to ensure that any misunderstanding leading to reluctance, refusal, or resistance of the Ebola response is followed up with and resolved as quickly as possible. This has been made possible by feedback from the community members, received through ongoing dialogue and various research activities within both the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and neighbouring areas. \n\nIn an effort to address the feedback received and specific concerns over the outbreak response, guided visits of the Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs) in various affected areas have been organized. Students and community associations who attended these guided visits to the ETCs can see first-hand how EVD patients are treated and help stop the potential dissemination of misinformation surrounding EVD and the ongoing response efforts.\n\nThe security situation has remained calm for the past week as well. Provisional results released on 9 April by the Commission \u00c9lectorale Nationale Ind\u00e9pendante concerning the national and provincial legislative elections in Beni, Butembo city (North Kivu), and Yumbi territory (Mai-Ndombe) have caused no significant unrest or disruption to outbreak response activities. \n\nThe continued increase in cases this past week reflects the complex reality of conducting an effective outbreak response in a geographically difficult area with a highly fluid population, intermittent attacks by armed groups, and limited healthcare infrastructure. Despite these challenges, WHO and partners remain committed to limiting the spread of EVD amongst these vulnerable populations through the continued strengthening of our multi-faceted response efforts. \nFigure 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by week of illness onset, data as of 9 April 2019*\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n*Data in recent weeks are subject to delays in case confirmation and reporting, as well as ongoing data cleaning.\nFigure 2: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by health area, North Kivu and Ituri provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo, data as of 9 April 2019\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nEnlarge image\n\n\nTable 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases, and number of health areas affected, by health zone, North Kivu and Ituri provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo, data as of 9 April 2019**\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nEnlarge image\n\n\n\n**Total cases and areas affected based during the last 21 days are based on the initial date of case alert, and may differ from date of confirmation and daily reporting by the Ministry of Health.\nPublic health response \n\nFor further detailed information about the public health response actions by the MoH, WHO, and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa:\n\n\nEbola situation reports: Democratic Republic of the Congo \n\nWHO risk assessment \n\nWHO continuously monitors changes to the epidemiological situation and context of the outbreak to ensure that support to the response is adapted to the evolving circumstances.

In addition, the persistence of pockets of community mistrust, exacerbated by political tensions and insecurity, have resulted in recurrent temporary suspension and delays of case investigation and response activities in affected areas; reducing the overall effectiveness of interventions. The high proportion of community deaths reported among confirmed cases, persistent delays in detection and isolation in ETCs, challenges in the timely reporting and response to probable cases, collectively increase the likelihood of further chains of transmission in affected communities and increased risk of geographical spread within the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to neighbouring countries.

        "Description of the Situation": "This past week saw a marked increase in the number of Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. During the last 21 days (13 March to 2 April 2019), 57 health areas within 12 health zones reported new cases; 42% of the 135 health areas affected to date (Table 1 and Figure 2). During this period, a total of 172 confirmed cases were reported from Katwa (50), Vuhovi (34), Mandima (28), Masereka (18), Beni (13), Butembo (12), Oicha (8), Kayna (3), Lubero (3), Kalunguta (1), Bunia (1) and Musienene (1). WHO and partners will continue to adapt our strategies and strengthen response efforts to limit the further spread of EVD in these health areas.\n\n\nAs of 2 April, a total of 1100 confirmed and probable EVD cases have been reported, of which 690 died (case fatality ratio 63%). Of the 1100 cases with reported age and sex, 58% (633) were female, and 29% (320) were children aged less than 18 years. The number of healthcare workers affected has risen to 81 (7% of total cases), including 27 deaths. \n\nTo date, a total of 338 EVD patients who received care at Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs) have been discharged. As part of a broader programme to provide care for Ebola survivors and build sustainable, local response capacity, an eye care training programme and clinic was completed this week in Beni through the combined efforts of WHO, Ministry of Health, and a team of ophthalmologists from Emory University and the University of North Carolina. A total of 252 EVD survivors were screened in the eye clinic and ten national ophthalmologists were trained to provide higher level eye care in their communities. Feedback from participating national healthcare providers and enrolled survivors was overwhelmingly positive. Of note were some of the clinical findings witnessed in the present cohort of EVD survivors. The team noted that complications such as uveitis were observed at lower rates when compared to cases from the 2014-16 West Africa EVD outbreak. \n\nA Risk Communication and Community Engagement partners meeting was held in Goma from 25-26 March, involving more than 80 participants representing the different partners participating in the outbreak response. The discussion focused on engagement strategies that have worked in the past, what is working on the ground currently, and what needs to be improved to build upon our current gains and address future challenges. \n\nThe recent shift of emphasis in the response strategy to promoting greater engagement and ownership by affected communities is beginning to produce results. While community reluctance and mistrust remain present in certain areas around Butembo and Katwa, other areas saw a notable decrease in resistance to the presence of response workers. Diligent efforts at engaging with community committees through direct dialogue resulted in the reopening of the ETC in Katwa, bringing the total number of operational facilities providing care up to six ETCs in Beni, Butembo, Goma, Komanda, Mangina, and six transit centres in Beni, Bunia, Katwa, Kayna, Bwanasura, and Oicha. A more proactive approach to investigating and resolving incidents in the communities is also being undertaken to minimise the risk of misunderstandings and to mitigate potential sources of mistrust between local residents and healthcare providers.\n\nThe increase in the number of cases this week highlights the difficult environment the outbreak is occurring in, as well as the multitude of evolving challenges confronting the outbreak response on a daily basis. A holistic approach involving rigorous implementation of proven measures to break chains of transmission, thorough contract tracing, continued vaccination of high-risk contacts, and persistent efforts in community engagement must be persevered with to curtail the spread of EVD in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nFigure 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by week of illness onset, data as of 2 April 2019*\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n*Data in recent weeks are subject to delays in case confirmation and reporting, as well as ongoing data cleaning.\nFigure 2: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by health area, North Kivu and Ituri provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo, data as of 29 March 2019\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nEnlarge image\n\n\nTable 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases, and number of health areas affected, by health zone, North Kivu and Ituri provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo, data as of 2 April 2019**\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nEnlarge image\n\n\n\n**Total cases and areas affected based during the last 21 days are based on the initial date of case alert, and may differ from date of confirmation and daily reporting by the Ministry of Health.",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "The ongoing Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the North Kivu and Ituri provinces saw a rise in the number of new cases this past week.",
        "Description of the Situation": "The ongoing Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the North Kivu and Ituri provinces saw a rise in the number of new cases this past week. At this time, response teams are facing daily challenges in ensuring timely and thorough identification and investigation of all cases amidst a backdrop of sporadic violence from armed groups and pockets of mistrust in some affected communities. Despite this, progress is being made in areas such as Mandima, Masereka and Vuhovi, where response teams are gradually able to access once again and acceptance by the community of proven interventions to break the chains of transmission is observed.\n\n\nDuring the last 21 days (6 \u2013 26 March), a total of 125 new cases were reported from 51 health areas within 12 of the 21 health zones affected to date; 38% of the 133 health areas affected to date (Figure 2). The majority of these cases were from remaining hotspot areas of Katwa (36), Butembo (14), and three emerging clusters in Mandima (19), Masereka (18) and Vuhovi (17), in addition to a limited number of cases in other areas (Table 1). All cases link back to chains of transmission in hotspot areas, with onward local transmission observed in a limited number of towns and villages within family/social networks or health centers where cases have visited prior to their detection and isolation.\n\nAs of 26 March, a total of 1029 confirmed and probable EVD cases have been reported, of which 642 died (case fatality ratio 62%). Of 1029 cases with reported age and sex, 57% (584) were female, and 30% (307) were children aged less than 18 years. The number of healthcare workers affected has risen to 78 (8% of total cases), including 27 deaths. \n\nCommunity engagement efforts to encourage greater local participation and ownership of the outbreak response is ongoing and has yielded some success in many areas. In Butembo and Katwa this past week, a total of 4171 households have been visited by community health volunteers and Red Cross volunteers. This past week also saw the establishment of nine community committees to enhance direct dialogue with healthcare workers and empower community members to partake in the decision-making process of the local response. Special dialogues are being held in the communities where there have been the most frequent incidents. Herein, an anthropologist first meets with the community to ascertain their concerns, then arranges for communal meetings where these concerns can be discussed, including amongst local youth leaders, women\u2019s associations, traditional practitioners, and healthcare providers.\n\nAs of 26 March, 324 EVD patients have recovered and been discharged from Ebola Treatment Centres. In Beni, local NGOs and international teams are currently conducting eye care training for ten ophthalmologists and establishing dedicated eye care clinics to provide screening and eye care for EVD survivors. To date, 145 survivors have been screened in these clinics and a total of 293 survivors have enrolled in the survivor\u2019s programme.\n\nNotable strides have also been made in improving IPC capacities in healthcare facilities. Since January, IPC field teams have decontaminated over 250 healthcare facilities and households, provided over 100 supply kits, and trained over 3000 healthcare workers in IPC. A recent National IPC workshop has been completed to aid the implementation of new IPC strategies, while the establishment of an IPC task force has further improved partner communication and coordination at all levels. The work is, however, is ongoing and IPC teams continue to respond to new instances of nosocomial transmission with the emergence of clusters in previously unaffected communities and health facilities. \n\nThese local successes do not come without its challenges. When visiting communities in high risk areas, Ebola response teams sometimes face security challenges. Though no major security incidents have been reported over the last 10 days, the overall situation remains fragile. WHO and partners have recently established operational analysis and coordination centres to both gain a more holistic understanding of how we can engage communities more effectively, as well as further increase operational awareness of the day to day operations to ensure the safety of frontline healthcare workers and the communities they are aiding. WHO and partners have also strengthened physical security in the treatment centres and accommodations of healthcare workers. \n\nFinding a balance between providing adequate operational protection to community members at risk of Ebola and healthcare workers while simultaneously winning the trust of communities remains an iterative learning process. WHO is constantly evolving the response efforts to address these operational challenges and will continue to step up collaboration with communities to increase acceptance on the ground. \nFigure 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by week of illness onset, data as of 26 March 2019*\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n*Data in recent weeks are subject to delays in case confirmation and reporting, as well as ongoing data cleaning.\nFigure 2: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by health area, North Kivu and Ituri provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo, data as of 24 March 2019\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nEnlarge image\n\n\nTable 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases, and number of health areas affected, by health zone, North Kivu and Ituri provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo, data as of 26 March 2019**\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nEnlarge image\n\n\n\n**Total cases and areas affected based during the last 21 days are based on the initial date of case alert, and may differ from date of confirmation and daily reporting by the Ministry of Health.",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces has recently shown an increase in the number of cases reported by week, after many weeks of overall decline (Figure 1).",
        "Description of the Situation": "The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces has recently shown an increase in the number of cases reported by week, after many weeks of overall decline (Figure 1). This rise is not unexpected and, in part, likely a result of the increased security challenges, including the recent direct attacks on treatment centers, and pockets of community mistrust, which slowed some response activities in affected areas for a few days.\n\n\nKatwa, Butembo, Masereka and Mandima account for over 80% of all cases in the last 21 days. A total of 97 confirmed cases were reported during the last 21 days from 38 of the 130 health areas affected to date (Table 1, Figure 2). This week, EVD was confirmed in an infant who died in Bunia Health Zone, but whose parents are in good health. This is the first confirmed case from this health zone; a previous case was identified from neighbouring Rwampara Health Zone in early February. While investigations are ongoing to determine the source of the infection, teams in place have rapidly implemented response activities including contact tracing, vaccination and heightened surveillance. Given the geographical spread of the epidemic and the high mobility in this region, the risk of Ebola spreading to unaffected areas or being reintroduced to previously affected areas remains high.\n\nResponse teams are fully operational in all outbreak affected areas. There are encouraging improvements in community acceptance of the response, despite the ongoing challenges of insecurity caused by armed groups. Over 90% of people eligible for vaccination have accepted to do so, and over 90% of these individuals having participated in follow-up visits. To date, 89 855 people have been vaccinated. Vaccination teams are continuing to follow-up on the rings where some families have not yet accepted the intervention.\n\nField laboratories have sustained similar testing rates as previous weeks. On average, 1300 samples are tested weekly and more than 23 000 samples have been tested to date with a turnaround time of less than 48 hours. Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs) and Transit Centres continue to operate, and the Katwa Transit Centre is being scaled up by ALIMA to increase capacity to respond to the outbreak in that area. To date, 335 patients have received one of the four investigational therapeutics under the MEURI protocol (compassionate use), and 80 patients under the RCT protocol.\n\nIn Butembo, Katwa, and Vuhovi health zones, response teams have continued to engage communities through various community dialogue platforms. Five community dialogue platforms have been organised in three health areas in Katwa, one health area in Butembo and one health area in Vuhovi. This initiative allows community members to participate and lead in decisions regarding Ebola response interventions in their localities. In other EVD-affected areas, ongoing activities include systematic collection of community feedback and responding to community concerns through adjustments of activities in consultation with community leaders and influencers. Community outreach activities are carried out in faith-based settings, market places, and schools with the collaboration of faith-based leaders and civil society groups (including women and youth). Civil society groups and community health volunteers also assist in the door-to-door community outreach activities on a regular basis.\n\nSince the beginning of the outbreak to 19 March 2019, 980 EVD cases1 (915 confirmed and 65 probable) have been reported, of which 57% (554) were female and 30% (293) were children aged less than 18 years. Cumulatively, cases have been reported from 130 of 339 health areas across 21 health zones of the North Kivu and Ituri provinces (Table 1). Overall, 610 deaths (case fatality ratio: 62%) have been reported, and 317 patients have been discharged after treatment in ETCs. \nFigure 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by week of illness onset, data as of 19 March 2019*\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n*Data in recent weeks are subject to delays in case confirmation and reporting, as well as ongoing data cleaning.\nFigure 2: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by health area, North Kivu and Ituri provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo, data as of 17 March 2019\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nEnlarge image\n\n\nTable 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases, and number of health areas affected, by health zone, North Kivu and Ituri provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo, data as of 19 March 2019\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nEnlarge image",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "The public health response to the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak continues to make gains.

        "Description of the Situation": "The public health response to the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak continues to make gains. During the last 21 days (20 February \u2013 12 March 2019), no new cases have been detected in 10 of the 20 health zones that have been affected during the outbreak (Figure 1). There has also been fewer new cases observed over the past five weeks compared to January 2019 and earlier in the outbreak (Figure 2).\n\n\nCurrently, the greatest concern centres on the neighbouring urban areas of Katwa and Butembo, which continue to contribute about three-quarters of recent cases. Clusters in other areas of North Kivu and Ituri provinces have been linked to chains of transmission in Katwa and Butembo, and have thus far been contained to limited local transmissions with relatively small numbers of cases. A total of 74 confirmed cases were reported during the last 21 days from 32 of the 125 health areas affected to date (Table 1). Risk of further chains of transmission and spread remain high, as highlighted by the recent spread to Lubero Health Zone, and reintroduction to Biena Health Zone following a prolonged period without new cases.\n\nResponse teams are fully operational in all outbreak affected areas and there are encouraging improvements in community acceptance of the response, despite the challenges of ongoing insecurity caused by armed groups. For example, during the last 21 days in Katwa and Butembo, 88% of the 256 families with a family member who died and was suspected to have EVD, accepted the support from response teams to conduct a safe and dignified burial. Seventy-four new vaccination rings were launched, with over 90% of people eligible for vaccination accepting to do so, and over 90% of these participated in follow-up visits. A total of 5974 people (including 2159 health and frontline workers) consented and were vaccinated this period; overall 87,632 people have been vaccinated to date. Vaccination teams are continuing to follow-up on 12 rings wherein the families have not yet accepted the intervention, and two other rings that are in the process of being defined. Seven field laboratories have remained fully operational, sustaining similar testing rates as previous weeks. During the past week, 1213 samples from new suspected cases, community deaths and previously confirmed cases were tested within 48 hours. Outreach teams made up mostly of local volunteers also met with 6000 households during the past week, building local knowledge of Ebola, and referring sick individuals to either Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs) or other health facilities as appropriate. In the last two weeks, community dialogues were held in several villages in Katwa and Vuhovi to find ways in engaging community members to build trust and ownership in the Ebola response.\n\nEfforts to strengthen case finding and investigation, and contact tracing activities are also bearing fruit. Of 74 confirmed cases reported in the last 21 days, 83% (62 cases) have been epidemiologically linked to active chains of transmission; either listed as contacts at illness onset (47 cases) or linked retrospectively to other cases or health centre where they were likely exposed (15 cases). Investigations are ongoing to identify links for the remaining cases.\n\nChallenges include further attacks by armed groups on affected communities and ETCs, elements of community mistrust, and persistent delays in getting people into care in ETCs for various reasons. The Ministry of Health, WHO and partners continue to work actively to build community trust and participation in the response, while reinforcing security measures to protect patients and response teams. The ETC in Butembo has been rebuilt following two attacks and is treating patients again, and the Katwa Transit Centre remains operational.\n\nSince the beginning of the outbreak to 12 March 2019, 927 EVD cases1 (862 confirmed and 65 probable) have been reported, of which 57% (525) were female and 30% (280) were children aged less than 18 years. Cumulatively, cases have been reported from 125 of 319 health areas across 20 health zones of the North Kivu and Ituri provinces (Table 1). Overall, 584 deaths (case fatality ratio: 63%) have been reported, and 308 patients have been discharged from ETCs.\nFigure 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by health area, North Kivu and Ituri provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo, data as of 10 March 2019\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nEnlarge image\n\n\nTable 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases, and number of health areas affected, by health zone, North Kivu and Ituri provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo, data as of 12 March 2019\n\n\n\n\n \n\nFigure 2: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by week of illness onset, data as of 12 March 2019*\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n*Data in recent weeks are subject to delays in case confirmation and reporting, as well as ongoing data cleaning.",

        "Description of the Situation": "The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak is continuing with moderate intensity. Katwa and Butembo remain the major health zones of concern, while small clusters continue simultaneously in some geographically dispersed locations. During the last 21 days (13 February \u2013 5 March 2019), 76 new confirmed and probable cases have been reported from 31 health areas within nine health zones (Figure 1), including: Katwa (44), Butembo (17), Mandima (6), Masereka (3), Kalunguta (2), Beni (1), Vuhovi (1), Kyondo (1), and Rwampara (1). The emerging cluster in Mandima health zone is occurring in a previously unaffected village, with five of the recent cases epidemiologically linked and the sixth case likely exposed in Butembo; nonetheless, there remains a high risk of further spread. Similarly, recent cases (two confirmed and one probable) in Masereka stem from a Butembo chain of transmission. These events highlight the importance for response teams to remain active across all areas, including those with lower case incidence, to rapidly detect new cases and prevent onward transmission.\n\n\nAs of 5 March, 907 EVD cases1 (841 confirmed and 66 probable) have been reported, of which 57% (514) were female and 30% (273) were children aged less than 18 years. Cumulatively, cases have been reported from 121 of 301 health areas across 19 health zones of the North Kivu and Ituri provinces. Overall, 569 deaths (case fatality ratio: 63%) have been reported, and 304 patients have been discharged from Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs). Although declining trends in case incidence are currently being observed, the high proportion of community deaths reported among confirmed cases, relatively low proportion of new cases who were known contacts under surveillance, persistent delays in detection and isolation in ETCs (related as well to recent violent incidents), and challenges in the timely reporting and response to probable cases, all increase the likelihood of further chains of transmission in affected communities and continued spread.\n\nFollowing the attacks on two ETCs in Katwa and Butembo, patients were temporarily transferred to the Katwa Transit Centre. On 2 March, the Butembo ETC was rehabilitated and resumed treatment of EVD patients. Response teams are progressively resuming activities in all affected areas with the exception of two health areas where security and community resistance remain a challenge.\nFigure 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by health area, North Kivu and Ituri provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo, data as of 03 March 2019\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nEnlarge image\n\n\nFigure 2: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by week of illness onset, data as of 5 March 2019*\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n*Data in recent weeks are subject to delays in case confirmation and reporting, as well as ongoing data cleaning \u2013 trends during this period should be interpreted cautiously.",

        "WHO Risk Assessment": "WHO continuously monitors changes to the epidemiological situation and context of the outbreak to ensure that support to the response is adapted to the evolving circumstances. National and regional risk levels remain very high, though global risk levels remain low. This EVD outbreak is primarily affecting the north-eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo bordering Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan. There is a potential risk for transmission of EVD at the national and regional levels due to extensive travel between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries for economic and personal reasons, as well as due to insecurity. The country is concurrently experiencing other epidemics (e.g. cholera, vaccine-derived poliomyelitis, malaria, measles) and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the fragile security situation in North Kivu and Ituri, further limits the implementation of response activities.\n\nAs the risk of national and regional spread is very high, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities. The International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) Emergency Committee has advised that failing to intensify these preparedness and surveillance activities would lead to worsening conditions and further spread. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring countries and partners to ensure that health authorities are alerted and are operationally prepared to respond.",

        "Description of the Situation": "The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak is continuing with moderate intensity. Katwa and Butembo remain the major health zones of concern, while simultaneously, small clusters continue to occur in various geographically dispersed locations. During the last 21 days (6 \u2013 26 February 2019), 77 new cases have been reported from 33 health areas within nine health zones (Figure 1), including: Katwa (45), Butembo (19), Vuhovi (4), Kyondo (3), Kalunguta (2), Oicha (1), Beni (1), Mandima (1), and Rwampara (1).\n\n\nAlthough there are decreasing trends in case incidence (Figure 2), the high proportion of community deaths reported among confirmed cases and relatively low number of new cases who were known contacts under surveillance could increase the risk of further chains of transmission in affected communities. Response teams must maintain a high degree of vigilance across all areas with declining case incidence and contact tracing activity, as well as in areas with active cases, to rapidly detect new cases and prevent onward transmission. Following attacks this week on the treatment centres in Katwa and Butembo, WHO is working with partners to ensure the safety of the patients and staff. These incidents are disruptive to the response on many levels and can also hamper surveillance activities in the field. \n\nAs of 26 February, 879 EVD cases1 (814 confirmed and 65 probable) have been reported, of which 57% (499) were female and 30% (264) were children aged less than 18 years. Cumulatively, cases have been reported from 119 of 301 health areas across 19 health zones. Overall, 553 deaths (case fatality ratio: 63%) have been reported and as of 19 February 2019, 257 survivors have been reported. There is ongoing cleaning of the case database to correct the number deaths and survivors discharged from Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs). \nFigure 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by health area, North Kivu and Ituri provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo, data as of 23 February 2019\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nEnlarge image\n\n\nFigure 2: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by week of illness onset, data as of 26 February 2019*\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSource: Ministry of Health, Democratic Republic of the Congo \n\n*Data in recent weeks are subject to delays in case confirmation and reporting, as well as ongoing data cleaning \u2013 trends during this period should be interpreted cautiously.",

National and regional risk levels remain very high, though global risk levels remain low. This EVD outbreak is affecting primarily the north-eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo bordering Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan. There is a potential risk for transmission of EVD at the national and regional levels due to extensive travel between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries for economic and personal reasons, as well as due to insecurity. The country is concurrently experiencing other epidemics (e.g. cholera, vaccine-derived poliomyelitis, malaria, measles), and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the fragile security situation in North Kivu and Ituri, further limits the implementation of response activities.\nAs the risk of national and regional spread is very high, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities.

Katwa and Butembo remain the major health zones of concern, while simultaneously, small clusters continue to occur in various geographically dispersed locations. During the last 21 days (30 January \u2013 19 February 2019), 79 new cases have been reported from 40 health areas within 12 health zones (Figure 1), including: Katwa (46), Butembo (15), Kyondo (4), Vuhovi (4), Kalunguta (2), Oicha (2), Biena (1), Mabalako (1), Manguredjipa (1), Masereka (1), Mutwanga (1), and Rwampara (1).1\n\n\nNo new cases have been reported from the Beni in the last three weeks. This is a significant achievement given the previous intensity of the outbreak in this area. Elsewhere, trends in the case incidence (Figure 2) have been encouraging; however, other indicators (such as the continued high proportion of community deaths, persistent delays in case detection, documented local travel amongst many cases, and relatively low numbers of cases among contacts under surveillance) suggest a high risk of further chains of transmission in affected communities. Response teams must maintain a high degree of vigilance across all areas with declining case and contact tracing activity, as with areas with active cases, to rapidly detect new cases and prevent onward transmission. \n\nAs of 19 February, 848 EVD cases2 (783 confirmed and 65 probable) have been reported, of which 57% (485) were female and 30% (258) were children aged less than 18 years.

Ongoing cleaning of case databases this past week corrected to the number of deaths and survivors discharged from Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs) thus far; overall 529 deaths (case fatality ratio: 62%) and 257 survivors have been reported to date. \n\nTo complement ongoing response activities, the Ministry of Health is establishing a Strategic Coordination Centre in Goma. The new Centre will support the coordination and monitoring of the operations in close collaboration with sub-coordination teams working across all affected areas. The implementation of the Strategic Coordination Centre in Goma will not impact on the response capacity in the field, with WHO and partners continuing to maintain full-scale operations in Beni, Butembo and Bunia, as well as a strong presence in all affected Health Zones, to ensure the effectiveness of field operations.\nFigure 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by health area, North Kivu and Ituri provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo, data as of 18 February 2019\n\n\n\n\n \n\nFigure 2: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by week of illness onset, data as of 19 February 2019*\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n*Data in recent weeks are subject to delays in case confirmation and reporting, as well as ongoing data cleaning \u2013 trends during this period should be interpreted cautiously.",

        "Description of the Situation": "14 February 2019\n\n \nFrom 1 January through 10 February 2019, 327 cases of Lassa fever (324 confirmed cases and three probable cases) with 72 deaths (case fatality ratio = 22%) have been reported across 20 states and the Federal Capital Territory, with the majority of cases being reported from Edo (108) and Ondo (103) states. Twelve cases have been reported among healthcare workers in seven states \u2013 Edo (4), Ondo (3), Ebonyi (1), Enugu (1), Rivers (1), Bauchi (1) and Benue (1) including one death in Enugu. \n\nThe number of confirmed cases reported across Nigeria remains high. In week 6, 2019 (week ending 10 February 2019), 37 new confirmed cases including 10 deaths (case fatality ratio = 27%) were reported from nine states across Nigeria. The majority of cases were reported from Ondo (12) and Edo (10) states. The number of confirmed cases reported in week 6, 2019 represents a slight decrease compared to week 5 when 68 confirmed cases were reported (Figure 1).\n\nOf the 3746 contacts identified since January 2019, 2658 are still under follow-up while 1045 have completed 21 days of follow-up. Sixty contacts became symptomatic, of which 39 tested positive.\n\nNinety-one case-patients are currently in admission at treatment centers across the country. The case-patients are being treated with standard supportive care.\nFigure 1: Number of confirmed and probable Lassa fever cases in Nigeria reported by the week of illness onset from 1 January through 10 February 2019\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSource: Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC)\nPublic health response\n\nOn 22 January 2019, the Nigeria Center for Disease Control (NCDC) declared the outbreak an emergency. \nMulti-sectoral One Health national rapid response teams have been deployed to Ondo, Edo, Ebonyi, Plateau, and Bauchi to support field investigation and response activities.\nEnhanced surveillance is ongoing in all states following alert communication and a press release from NCDC.\nTreatment of Lassa fever cases is also ongoing at designated treatment centres across the country. \nRisk communication and community engagement activities continue in the states. National awareness was improved through the recently concluded international Lassa fever conference which took place from 16 through 17 January 2019.\n\nWHO risk assessment\n\nLassa fever is a viral haemorrhagic fever that is transmitted to humans via contact with food or household items contaminated with rodent urine or faeces. Person-to-person infections and laboratory transmission can also occur. The overall case fatality rate is 1%; it is 15% among patients hospitalized with severe illness. There is currently no approved vaccine. Early supportive care with rehydration and symptomatic treatment improves survival.\n\nAlthough Lassa fever is known to be endemic in Nigeria with the peak season anticipated from December through June, the current increase in new confirmed cases and deaths should be monitored closely and addressed appropriately. Cases in neigbouring Benin and Togo potentially originating from Nigeria have been reported in previous years and therefore neighbouring countries should be monitored accordingly. \n\nWith twelve confirmed cases so far among healthcare workers, there is evidence of nosocomial transmission of the disease amidst reports of inadequate infection prevention and control (IPC) supplied in some health facilities and complacency on the part of health workers towards maintaining IPC measures.\nWHO advice\n\nPrevention of Lassa fever relies on community engagement and promoting hygienic conditions to discourage rodents from entering homes. In healthcare settings, staff should consistently implement standard infection prevention and control measures when caring for patients to prevent nosocomial infections. WHO continues to advice all countries in the Lassa fever belt on the need to enhance early detection and treatment of cases to reduce the case fatality rate as well as strengthen cross-border collaboration.\n\nWHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction to Nigeria based on the currently available information.\n\nFor more information on Lassa fever, please see the link below:\n\n\nWHO fact sheet on Lassa fever",

        "Description of the Situation": "Despite slightly fewer cases reported during the past week (Figure 1), current epidemiological indicators highlight that the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak is continuing with moderate intensity. Katwa and Butembo remain the major health zones of concern, while simultaneously, small clusters continue to occur in various geographically dispersed regions. During the last 21 days (23 January \u2013 12 February 2019), 97 new cases have been reported from 13 health zones (Figure 2), including: Katwa (59), Butembo (12), Beni (7), Kyondo (4), Oicha (4), Vuhovi (3), Biena (2), Kalunguta (2), Komanda (1), Manguredjipa (1), Mabalako (1), Masereka (1), and Mutwanga (1).1 The recent case reported in the Komanda health zone was a resident of Katwa who was exposed to the virus, and subsequently travelled to both Bunia and Komanda. This case comes one month after the last reported case in Ituri Province; underscoring the high risks of reintroduction to previously affected areas, as well as the potential for spread to new ones.\n\n\nAs of 12 February, 823 EVD cases2 (762 confirmed and 61 probable) have been reported, including 517 deaths (overall case fatality ratio: 63%). Cumulatively, cases have been reported from 118 of 287 health areas across 18 health zones, of which 37 health areas have reported a case in the last 21 days. Thus far, 283 people have been discharged from Ebola Treatment Centers (ETCs) and enrolled in a dedicated monitoring and support programme. One new health worker infection was reported in Katwa. To date, a total of 68 health workers have been infected.\n\nMain challenges this past week primarily pertain to community mistrust, particularly in Katwa, and the difficulty in encouraging community members to be more proactive in reporting suspected cases, presenting early to ETCs for treatment, and participating in community-based prevention and response efforts. However, in the face of these protracted challenges, response strategies have demonstrated to be effective in curtailing the spread of EVD. Fostering greater community trust by strengthening engagement with its members remains a top priority for response teams. \n\nOn 13 February, the Ministry of Health (MoH) launched the Strategic Response Plan 3 (SRP 3). The plan lays out the response strategy, objectives and budget requirements for the MoH, WHO, and all implementing partners for the next six months (February through July 2019). SRP 3 takes into account recommendations from operational reviews, and builds on a series of new strategic directions that capitalize on lessons learned under the scope of SRP 2. Activities laid out aim to stop the transmission of EVD in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, and prevent its spread to other provinces and neighbouring countries. \n\nWHO remains confident that this outbreak can be successfully brought to an end through strategies outlined in SRP 3. To achieve the goals set out by the plan, MoH, WHO, and partners are appealing for US$ 148 million. WHO and partners count on the continued support of the international community to provide the required funding in order to stop this outbreak.\nFigure 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by week of illness onset, data as of 12 February 2019 (n=822)\n\n\n\n\n \n\nFigure 2: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases reported between 22 January and 11 February by place of residence, North Kivu and Ituri provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo (n=101)*\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n*Map based on the latest available detailed line lists (data as of 11 February 2019), and excludes cases reported after this date, as well as cases with delayed/missing village or health area details.

        "Description of the Situation": "11 February 2019\n\n \nBrazil is currently in the seasonal period for yellow fever, which occurs from December through May. The expansion of the historical area of yellow fever transmission to areas in the south-east of the country in areas along the Atlantic coast previously considered risk-free led to two waves of transmission (Figure 1). One during the 2016\u20132017 seasonal period, with 778 human cases, including 262 deaths, and another during the 2017\u20132018 seasonal period, with 1376 human cases, including 483 deaths. \n\nFrom December 2018 through January 2019, 361 confirmed human cases, including eight deaths, have been reported in 11 municipalities of two states of Brazil. In the southern part of S\u00e3o Paulo state, seven municipalities:El dorado (16 cases), Jacupiranga (1 case), Iporanga (7 cases), Cananeia (3 cases), Cajati (2), Pariquera-A\u00e7u (1), and Sete Barras (1) reported confirmed cases. In the same state, additional cases in Vargem (1) and Serra Negra (1) municipalities were confirmed on the border with Minas Gerais State. Additionally, two cases have been confirmed in the municipalities of Antonina and Adrian\u00f3polis, located in the eastern part of Paran\u00e1 State. These are the first confirmed yellow fever cases reported since 2015 from Paran\u00e1, a populous state with an international border. Among these confirmed cases, 89% (32/36) are male, the median age is 43 years, and at least 64% (23/36) are rural workers. \n\nHuman cases reported so far during the current 2018\u20132019 period (July 2018 to Jan 2019) in nine municipalities in S\u00e3o Paulo State, as well as the confirmation of human cases and epizootic due to yellow fever in the state of Paran\u00e1, mark the beginning of what could be a third wave and a progression of the outbreak towards the Southeast and South regions of the country (Figure 2). While too early to determine if this year will show the high numbers of human cases observed in the last two large seasonal peaks, there is indication that the virus transmission is continuing to spread in a southerly direction and in areas with low population immunity. \nFigure 1. Distribution of confirmed human yellow fever cases by date of onset of symptoms in Brazil from 2016\u20132019\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSource: Data published by the Brazil Ministry of Health (2016\u20132018, as of 15 December 2018) and the S\u00e3o Paulo State Secretariat of Health (22 December 2018 through 26 January 2019) and reproduced by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO/WHO)\nFigure 2. Distribution of epizootics and confirmed human cases in Brazil from 1 January 2016 through 26 January 2019\n\n\n\n\n \n\nSurveillance of non-human primate (NHP) epizootics\n\nFrom 1 July 2018 through 18 January 2019, 25 confirmed epizootics were reported in five federal entities: S\u00e3o Paulo (13), Rio de Janeiro (8), Minas Gerais (1), Mato Grosso (2) and Parana (1). In the last four weeks epizootics have been confirmed in S\u00e3o Paulo and Parana states. Additionally, the Paran\u00e1 Secretariat of Health reported that tests performed on dead monkeys in Antonina, on the Paran\u00e1 coast, were positive for yellow fever. Given the gradual geographical expansion of the epizootic wave that Brazil has faced during the last two seasonal periods, the country has had to adapt its immunization policies for yellow fever. The number of areas with recommended vaccination has increased from 3526 municipalities in 2010 to 4469 (out of 55702) municipalities in 2018. In line with the World Health Organization guidelines, Brazil has adopted a single dose vaccination scheme for yellow fever since April 2017. \nPublic health response\n\nDuring the 2017\u20132018 season, Brazil adopted the use of fractional dose yellow fever vaccination to respond to outbreaks and the risk of urbanization of yellow fever, especially in large cities. This strategy was implemented in 77 municipalities with the greatest risk for yellow fever in the states of S\u00e3o Paulo (54 municipalities), Rio de Janeiro (15 municipalities), and Bah\u00eda (8 municipalities). \n\nAs of 29 September 2018, preliminary results of the mass vaccination campaign against yellow fever indicate that 13.3 million people in S\u00e3o Paulo, 6.5 million in Rio de Janeiro, and 1.85 million in Bah\u00eda states were vaccinated, which represents vaccination coverage of 53.6%, 55.6% and 55.0%, respectively3 .\n\nFurthermore, data from the Brazil Ministry of Health indicates that vaccination coverage of 95% and greater has been reached in 13% (57/435) of municipalities considered to be at-risk in Paran\u00e1, 21% (113/531) of municipalities at-risk in Rio Grande do Sul, 19% (155/838) of municipalities at-risk in S\u00e3o Paulo, and 9% (38/428) of municipalities at-risk in Santa Catarina. \n\nBrazil has recommended additional supplementary vaccination of approximately 3 million persons in Sao Paulo State in urban areas in response to the current season, albeit not yet determined whether full or fractional dose. In January 2019, vaccinations also began in 36 Quilombo communities. Additionally, the state and affected municipalities developed a task force who have targeted vaccination of 28 299 unvaccinated additional persons in coming days in municipalities of Cajati, Iporanga, and Barra do Turvo.\nWHO risk assessment\n\nFurther transmission is expected in the coming months based on seasonal patterns. Recent human cases of yellow fever during the current seasonal cycle have been reported in S\u00e3o Paulo and Paran\u00e1 states in Southeast Brazil. \n\nThe preliminary results of the vaccination coverages in municipalities from Paran\u00e1, Rio Grande do Sul, S\u00e3o Paulo, and Santa Catarina states suggests a high proportion of persons remaining at-risk and the necessity to intensify risk communications among high-risk groups.\n\nThe geographical distribution of human cases and epizootics from the current and previous two seasonal cycles suggests southward movement of the virus, which presents further risk to the states of Paran\u00e1, Rio Grande do Sul, and Santa Catarina, as no epizootics or human cases were confirmed in recent years prior. Furthermore, these areas have ecosystems favorable for yellow fever transmission and borders with other countries such as Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay.\n\nDuring the previous season cycle, human yellow fever cases were reported among travelers, though to date, most imported cases have been reported in countries where the vector is absent (or absent during winter). These reports illustrate the importance of maintaining high levels of awareness, especially for international travelers from areas with favorable ecosystems for yellow fever transmission.\n\nTo date, yellow fever transmission by Aedes aegypti has not been documented, however the high incidence observed in the last two seasons may reflect the increased contact of sylvatic environments (vectors and non-human primates) and under-protected populations in urban or peri-urban settings. The sylvatic yellow fever virus is transmitted to monkeys by forest dwelling mosquitoes such as Haemagogus and Sabethes spp. Humans who are exposed to these mosquitoes can become infected if they are not vaccinated. In entomological studies conducted during the 2016\u20132017 outbreak in some of the affected states, isolated Haemagogus mosquitoes were found to be positive for yellow fever, indicating predominantly sylvatic transmission. More recently, an investigation conducted by the Evandro Chagas Institute reported by the Brazil Ministry of Health revealed the detection of yellow fever virus in Aedes albopictus mosquitoes captured in rural areas of two municipalities in Minas Gerais (Itu\u00eata and Alvarenga) in 2017. The significance of this finding requires further investigation. The last documented outbreak of urban yellow fever in Brazil was recorded in 1942.\n\nWHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and review the risk assessment based on the latest available information. Currently, based on available information, WHO assesses the overall risk as high at the national level, moderate at the regional level, and low at the global level. \nWHO advice\n\nOn 25 January 2019, PAHO/WHO alerted4 Member States about the beginning of the seasonal period for yellow fever and therefore, the highest risk of transmission to unvaccinated humans. Thus, PAHO/WHO advises Member States with areas at-risk for yellow fever to continue efforts to immunize the at-risk populations and to take the necessary actions to keep travelers informed and vaccinated prior to traveling to areas where yellow fever vaccination is recommended.\n\nWHO recommends vaccination of international travellers above nine months of age going to Brazil. The updated areas at-risk for yellow fever transmission and the related recommendations for vaccination of international travellers were updated by WHO on 3 May 20185; the map of revised areas at risk and yellow fever vaccination recommendations is available on the WHO International Travel and Health website.\n\n\nWHO International Travel and Health\n\n\n\nYellow fever can easily be prevented through immunization, provided that vaccination is administered at least 10 days before travel. Yellow fever vaccination is safe, highly effective and provides life-long protection. In accordance with the IHR (2005), the validity of the international certificate of vaccination against yellow fever extends to the life of the person vaccinated. A booster dose of yellow fever vaccine cannot be required of international travellers as a condition of entry.\n\nAwareness of the signs and symptoms of yellow fever are recommended for anyone living or traveling in areas at risk for yellow fever transmission. Persons experiencing symptoms are encouraged to seek healthcare quickly. \n\nWHO recommends against the application of any general travel or trade restrictions to Brazil based on the information available for this event.\nResources\n\nInformation on the yellow fever situation in Brazil and other countries in the Americas is published regularly on the PAHO/WHO website and on the Brazil Ministry of Health website:\n\n\nPAHO: Epidemiological Alerts and Updates \n\n\n\nFebre Amarela: causas, sintomas, diagn\u00f3stico, preven\u00e7\u00e3o e tratamento \n\n\nFor more information on yellow fever, please see:\n\n\nPAHO/WHO yellow fever fact sheet \n\nWHO yellow fever health topics\n\n\nWHO list of countries with vaccination requirements and recommendations for international travellers \n\nWHO yellow fever risk mapping and recommended vaccination for travellers \n\nWHO strategy for yellow fever epidemic preparedness and response\n\n\n\n\n1The probable place of infection for one confirmed human case is currently under investigation.\n\n2Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE, per its acronym in Portuguese)\n\n3It should be noted that these figures include 11.3 million people vaccinated in the three states prior to the start of the mass vaccination campaign, which began on 25 January 2018 in S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro and on 19 February 2018 in Bah\u00eda.\n\n\n4Pan American Health Organization / World Health Organization.

        "Description of the Situation": "The Ebola virus disease (EVD) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo continues with relatively high numbers of cases reported in recent weeks (Figure 1), and some encouraging signs. Katwa and Butembo health zones remain the epicentres of the outbreak, reporting 71% of cases in the last three weeks, with smaller clusters continuing to occur concurrently across a geographically dispersed area.\n\n\nAs of 5 February, 789 EVD cases1 (735 confirmed and 54 probable) have been reported, including 488 deaths (overall case fatality ratio: 62%). Thus far, 267 people have been discharged from Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs) and enrolled in a dedicated monitoring and support programme. Among cases with available information regarding age and sex, 58% (454/788) were female, and 30% (232/786) were aged less than 18 years; including 116 children under five years. Five new health worker infections were reported in Katwa (4) and Kalunguta (1); overall 67 health workers have been affected to date. \n\nDuring the last 21 days (16 January \u2013 5 February 2019), 119 new cases have been reported from 13 health zones (Figure 2), including: Katwa (75), Butembo (9), Beni (8), Kyondo (5), Kayna (5), Oicha (4), Manguredjipa (4), Biena (2), Kalunguta (2), Mabalako (2), Masereka (1), Mutwanga (1), and Vuhovi (1)2. Current epidemiological analyses points to nosocomial transmission due to poor infection prevention and control (IPC) practices, persistent delays in detection and isolation of new cases, frequent community deaths (and subsequent contact with deceased), and transmission within family and community networks, as the main drivers of ongoing disease transmission. Insecurity and pockets of community resistance have continuously stifled efforts to combat these risks; nevertheless, response teams remain committed to actively strengthening community trust and participation in all affected areas, and are beginning to observe tangible improvements in Katwa and elsewhere.\n\nKomanda Health Zone has recently passed the most risky transmission period, with the last confirmed case reported on 11 January and all contacts completing the minimum follow-up period; however, a high degree of vigilance will need to be maintained to rapidly detect potential flare-ups and reintroductions here and in other previously affected areas. \nFigure 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by week of illness onset, data as of 5 February 2019 (n=789)1\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1 Data in recent weeks are subject to delays in case confirmation and reporting, as well as ongoing data cleaning \u2013 trends during this period should be interpreted cautiously.\n\n2The five probable cases from Komanda (all of whom died in November 2018), were reported during the week of 21 \u2013 27 January 2019 following a retrospective re-classification of cases.\nFigure 2: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by health zone in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo, data as of 5 February 2019 (n=789)",

        "WHO Risk Assessment": "WHO reviewed its risk assessment on 9 January 2019 for the outbreak and the risk remains very high at the national and regional levels; the global risk level remains low. This Ebola virus outbreak is affecting north-eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo bordering Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan. There is a potential risk for transmission of Ebola virus at the national and regional levels due to extensive travel between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries for economic and personal reasons as well as due to insecurity. The country is concurrently experiencing other epidemics (e.g. cholera, vaccine-derived poliomyelitis, malaria), and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the security situation in North Kivu and Ituri at times limits the implementation of response activities.\nAs the risk of national and regional spread is very high, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities. The International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) Emergency Committee has advised that failing to intensify these preparedness and surveillance activities would lead to worsening conditions and further spread. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring countries and partners to ensure that health authorities are alerted and are operationally prepared to respond.",
        "WHO Advice": "International traffic: WHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for passengers leaving the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.\nFor more information, see:\n\nSouth Sudan vaccinates health workers against Ebola\nEbola - Following a Full Simulation Exercise, a Joint Monitoring Mission is deployed in Rwanda\nSummary report for the SAGE meeting of October 2018\nStatement on the October 2018 meeting of the IHR Emergency Committee on the Ebola virus disease outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\nWHO Interim recommendation Ebola vaccines\nWHO recommendations for international travellers related to the Ebola Virus Disease outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\nEbola virus disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo \u2013 Operational readiness and preparedness in neighbouring countries\nEbola virus disease fact sheet",

        "Description of the Situation": "4 February 2019\n\n \nOn 3 January 2019, the International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Point of Jamaica notified WHO of an increase in dengue cases in Jamaica. \n\nFrom 1 January though 21 January 2019, 339 suspected and confirmed cases including six deaths were reported (Figure 1). In 2018, a total of 986 suspected and confirmed cases of dengue including 13 deaths have been reported. The number of reported dengue cases in 2018 was 4.5 times higher than that reported in 2017 (215 cases including six deaths). Cases reported to date for 2019 exceed the epidemic threshold (Figure 2). \n\nAccording to historic data, Jamaica reported a major outbreak in 2016, when 2297 cases of dengue infection including two deaths were reported. Dengue virus 3 (DENV3) and DENV4 circulations were confirmed at the time. \n\nBy the end of 2018, the largest number of reported cases were notified by Kingston and Saint Andrew parishes. In 2019 so far, the largest proportion of cases have been reported by Saint Catherine parish.\n\nLaboratory tests have identified DENV3 as the dengue serotype currently circulating.\n\nIn January 2019, some countries and territories in the Caribbean region, such as Guadeloupe, Martinique, and Saint Martin, reported an increase in dengue cases. Of note, in Saint Martin and Guadeloupe, serotype DENV1 is currently circulating. \nFigure 1. Dengue fever cases and deaths by week of onset from 1 January 2018 through 21 January 2019 in Jamaica*\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSource: Jamaica Ministry of Health and reproduced by PAHO/WHO\n\n\n*Cumulative suspected/ presumed/ confirmed cases = 1325\nFigure 2. Suspected, presumed and confirmed dengue cases by month for 2018 and 2019 versus monthly averages and epidemic threshold for Jamaica\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSource: Jamaica Ministry of Health and reproduced by PAHO/WHO\nPublic health response \n\nThe Ministry of Health (MoH) declared the dengue outbreak on 3 January 2019.\nHealth authorities in Jamaica are implementing measures for the following activities; strengthened integrated vector control, enhanced surveillance of cases, social mobilization, clinical management, enhanced laboratory diagnostic capacity, and emergency risk communications. \nThe MoH has been collaborating with the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) and other international agencies to strengthen and co-ordinate the response activities.\nSince July 2018, the MoH has intensified its vector control activities. \nThe MoH launched the Emergency Operations Centre on 27 December 2018; and fully activated it on 3 January 2019 to facilitate the coordination and reporting of activities. The response activities are geared towards strengthening the response capacity with adequate human resources, as well as supporting efforts to reduce the entomological indices for the Aedes aegypti mosquito across the island and enhancing clinical management capacity.\n\nWHO risk assessment\n\nJamaica has been reporting dengue cases since 1990 and throughout 2018; however, an increase has been observed since December 2018 exceeding the epidemic threshold. Similar large increases were reported in 2010 (2887 cases), 2012 (4670 cases), and 2016 (2297 cases). The increase of dengue in the Caribbean islands may result in more severe secondary dengue virus infections and require comprehensive risk communication.\nWHO advice\n\nOn 21 November 2018, PAHO/WHO alerted Member States about an increase in dengue cases in countries and territories in the Americas and recommended coordinated actions both inside and outside of the health sector, including prioritizing activities to prevent transmission of dengue as well as deaths due to this disease.\n\nPAHO/WHO further advises to follow the key recommendations regarding outbreak preparedness and response, case management, laboratory, and integrated vector management as published in the 21 November 2018 PAHO/WHO Epidemiological Update on Dengue, available at the link below. \n\n\nPAHO Epidemiological Alert: Dengue (21 November 2018) \n\n\nThere is no specific treatment for disease due to dengue; therefore, prevention is the most important step to reduce the risk of dengue infection. WHO recommends proper and timely case management of dengue cases. Surveillance should continue to be strengthened within all affected areas and at the national level. Key public health communication messages should continue to be provided to reduce the risk of transmission of dengue in the population.\n\nIn addition, integrated vector management (IVM) activities should be enhanced to remove potential breeding sites, reduce vector populations, and minimize individual exposures. This should include both larval and adult vector control strategies (i.e. environmental management and source reduction, and chemical control measures), as well as strategies to protect individuals and households. Where indoor biting occurs, household insecticide aerosol products, mosquito coils, or other insecticide vaporizers may also reduce biting activity. Household fixtures such as window and door screens and air conditioning can also reduce biting. Since Aedes mosquitoes (the primary vector for transmission) are day-biting mosquitoes, personal protective measures such as use of clothing that minimizes skin exposure during daylight hours is recommended. Repellents may be applied to exposed skin or to clothing. The use of repellents must be in strict accordance with label instructions. Insecticide-treated mosquito nets afford good protection for those who sleep during the day (e.g. infants, the bedridden, and night-shift workers) as well as during the night to prevent mosquito bites.\n\nWHO does not recommend any general travel or trade restrictions be applied based on the information available for this event.",

        "Description of the Situation": "The Ministry of Health (MoH), WHO and partners continue to respond to an outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD), despite persistent challenges around security and community mistrust impacting response measures. Relatively high numbers of cases were reported in recent weeks (Figure 1), mostly driven by the outbreak in Katwa Health Zone; the current focus of large scale response activities. Smaller clusters continue to be reported beyond Katwa Health Zone, including from Beni and Oicha; however, teams have quickly and systematically responded to these clusters to prevent onward transmission and guard against further geographical expansion of the outbreak. Teams are also working actively to strengthen community trust and participation in all affected areas.\n\n\nAs we approach six months since declaration of the outbreak, there have been a total of 752 EVD cases1 (698 confirmed and 54 probable) reported, including 465 deaths (overall case fatality ratio: 62%) as of 29 January 2019. Thus far, 259 people have been discharged from Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs) and enrolled in a dedicated program for monitoring and supporting survivors. Among cases with a reported age and sex, 59% (439/750) were female, and 30% (224/749) were aged less than 18 years; including 115 children under 5 years. \n\nDuring the last 21 days (9 January \u2013 29 January 2019), 118 new cases have been reported from 11 health zones (Figure 2), including: Katwa (80), Beni (9), Butembo (7), Kayina (5), Manguredjipa (4), Oicha (4), Biena (3), Kyondo (2), Musienene (2), Komanda (1) and Vuhovi (1). In addition, five historic probable cases from Komanda Health Zone were reported during the past week with illness onset dating back to November 2018. \n\nThe outbreak in Katwa and Butembo health zones is partly being driven by nosocomial transmission events in private and public health centres. Since 1 December 2018, 86% (125/145) of cases in these areas had visited or worked in a health care facility before or after their onset of illness. Of those, 21% (30/145) reported contact with a health care facility before their onset of illness, suggesting possible nosocomial transmission. In Katwa during the past 3 weeks (since 9 January), 49 health structures were identified where confirmed cases were hospitalised, including nine health centres where nosocomial transmission potentially occurred. Moreover, during the same period, eight new health care worker (HCW) infections were reported in Katwa; overall, 65 HCWs have been infected to date. Response teams are following up with the identified health care facilities to address gaps around triage, case detection and infection prevention and control measures.\nFigure 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by week of illness onset, data as of 29 January 2019 (n=752)* \n\n\n\n\n\n *Data in recent weeks are subject to delays in case confirmation and reporting, as well as ongoing data cleaning \u2013 trends during this period should be interpreted cautiously.\n\n \n\nFigure 2: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by health zone in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo, data as of 29 January 2019 (n=752)",

A test-of-cure (TOC) was carried out and she was found to have cleared the pathogen.\n\nThe second case, a heterosexual female who attended sexual health services in the United Kingdom in November 2018. She reported a casual male sexual contact in the United Kingdom in November 2018 who was known to be in Ibiza, Spain from June until September 2018.The case was treated empirically with ceftriaxone 1 g. A TOC was carried out and she had not cleared the pathogen. She was then given gentamicin 240 mg (intramuscular) and azithromycin 2 mg (oral). She was given intravenous ertapenem for three days as the symptoms were not resolved. A TOC was carried out afterwards and she was found to have cleared the pathogen.\n\nThe two isolates are resistant to ceftriaxone (MIC 1.0 mg/L) and have intermediate susceptibility to azithromycin (MIC 0.5 mg/L). The isolates are also resistant to cefixime, penicillin, ciprofloxacin and tetracycline, but are susceptible to spectinomycin. These isolates differ from the case previously reported in March 2018 by the United Kingdom and the two cases reported by Australia in April 2018, which had high-level resistance to azithromycin.\n\nPublic Health England had set up an incident management team to coordinate the investigations and communication, ensure contacts are traced and spread contained. Since there is a probable epidemiological link to sexual encounters with United Kingdom citizens who have travelled to Ibiza, Spain, the United Kingdom informed Spain about these cases via the Early Warning and Response System (EWRS) of the European Union.\nPublic health response\n\nPublic Health England promptly initiated appropriate public health measures, including: the creation of an incident management team for coordinating the response, outbreak investigations, contact tracing, surveillance and risk communication. \n\nPublic Health services in the Balearic Islands and in Ibiza, Spain have been informed about this public health alert related to United Kingdom citizens infected with XDR N. gonorrhoeae who travelled to Ibiza. Treatment of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in Ibiza is included in services provided by the Public Health Service of the Balearic Islands and diagnosis is carried out at the laboratory of the main public hospital in Ibiza. Currently, there is no strain of N. gonorrhoeae isolated in Ibiza presenting the resistance pattern described by the United Kingdom.\n\nFurther investigations are needed to confirm the epidemiological link, the source of transmission and identify sexual partners of contacts of the United Kingdom cases, both in the United Kingdom and in Spain. Further public health control measures will be considered after information about possible sexual partners of United Kingdom contacts of the cases is made available by the Public Health England.\nWHO risk assessment\n\nThis is the fourth report of XDR N. gonorrhoeae infection in the United Kingdom. These current cases are resistant to ceftriaxone and have intermediate susceptibility to azithromycin, which increasingly threatens the dual therapy for gonorrhoea (ceftriaxone 250\u2009mg and azithromycin 1 g) recommended by WHO.\n\nSince the majority of gonorrhoea cases are asymptomatic, spread of resistant gonorrhoea strains is possible and can spread quickly in high risk populations. For these two cases there is an epidemiological link to sexual encounters with United Kingdom citizens in Ibiza, Spain, or United Kingdom citizens who have been in Ibiza, which indicates potential international spread of this resistant gonorrhoea strain. This must be done to implement appropriate public health measures and interrupt transmission of the infection, measures include: strengthening gonorrhoea antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance and ensuring timely reporting.\n\nContact tracing and response measures, including condom promotion, have been taken by Public Health England and the risk for potential further transmission in the United Kingdom by these two cases is currently considered to be low.\nWHO advice\n\nTo make a sustained difference in the continuing problem of multidrug-resistant N. gonorrhoeae infection, two overlapping goals must be met: broad-based control of drug resistance and control of gonococcal infection. Both should be approached in the wider contexts of global control of antimicrobial resistance. For gonococcal infections, the public health approach must build upon lessons learnt and put the following points into action:\n\nUse of condoms as effective prevention and control of gonococcal infections, STI screening of high risk populations and effective STI case management to diagnose and provide appropriate treatment regimens, including partner management and to prevent transmission and re-infection through health education and behavior change counselling.\nAppropriate use of antibiotics, including effective drug regulations.\nEstablished and strengthened gonorrhoea AMR surveillance, including timely reporting, especially in countries with a high burden of gonococcal infections, to inform national gonorrhoea treatment guidelines and public health policies and provide comparable and quality data globally.\nCapacity building to establish regional and national networks of laboratories to perform gonococcal culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing, with good quality control mechanisms.\nStrengthening follow-up of gonorrhoea cases and detection, management of treatment failure cases based on standard case definition of treatment failure and protocols for monitoring, and systematic monitoring of treatment failures. \nFast track of the development of point-of-care testing for diagnosing gonorrhoea and newer molecular methods for monitoring and detecting AMR to support antibiotic stewardship.\nIdentification of, and research into, alternative effective treatment regimens for gonococcal infections.\n\n\nFor more information about antimicrobial resistance or STIs, please see the following: \n\n\nAntimicrobial resistance fact sheet  \n\nSexually transmitted infections (STIs) fact sheet \n\n\nReferences:\n\nTapsall, J.

        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "The Ministry of Health (MoH), WHO and partners have continued to face challenges in the containment and control of the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The number of reported cases increased during recent weeks, most notably from the Katwa health zone where response teams have faced pockets of community mistrust. The outbreak has also extended southwards to Kayina health zone, a high security risk area. Teams are working actively to build community trust and scale up response activities around these new clusters.Figure 1 shows that as of 22 January 2019, there have been a total of 713 EVD cases1 (664 confirmed and 49 probable), including 439 deaths (overall case fatality ratio: 62%). Thus far, 247 people have been discharged from Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs), with many having enrolled in a dedicated program for monitoring and supporting survivors. Among cases with a reported age and sex, 59% (420/710) of cases were female, and 30% (214/708) were aged less than 18 years; including 108 infants and children under 5 years. Sixty-one healthcare workers have been infected to date.During the last 21 days (2 January \u2013 22 January 2019), 102 new cases have been reported from 13 health zones (Figure 2), including: Katwa (62), Butembo (12), Oicha (6), Kayina (5), Beni (2), Manguredjipa (3), Kyondo (3), Kalungata (2), Komanda (1), Musienene (2), Biena (2), Mabalako (1), and Vuhovi (1). The current outbreak hotspots of Butembo and Katwa encompass an urban area with a population of approximately one million people. Of the 148 cases reported in Katwa to date, less than half (55/148) were registered as contacts at the time of illness onset. Moreover, 10% (14/148) of these cases comprised of healthcare workers, and among those with available information, 42% (45/107) reported having attended a funeral in the weeks prior to illness onset. Collectively, these figures suggest that the observed increase in Katwa is being driven by a combination of both healthcare facility and community-based transmissions. Health protection and control measures such as infection prevention and control in health centers, vaccination for healthcare and other frontline workers, and safe and dignified burial practices, are being strengthened to interrupt the chains of transmission.Figure 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by week of illness onset, data as of 22 January 2019 (n=713)* *Data in recent weeks are subject to delays in case confirmation and reporting, as well as ongoing data cleaning \u2013 trends during this period should be interpreted cautiously.\nFigure 2: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by health zone in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo, data as of 22 January 2019 (n=713)",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "The MoH continues to strengthen response measures, with support from WHO and partners. Priorities include coordination, surveillance, contact tracing, laboratory capacity, infection prevention and control, clinical management of patients, vaccination, risk communication and community engagement, psychosocial support, safe and dignified burials, cross-border surveillance, and preparedness activities in neighbouring provinces and countries.\nFor detailed information about the public health response actions by WHO and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa:\n\nEbola situation reports: Democratic Republic of the Congo",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "WHO reviewed its risk assessment for the outbreak and the risk remains very high at the national and regional levels; the global risk level remains low. This outbreak of EVD is affecting north-eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo bordering Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan. There is a potential risk for transmission of EVD at the national and regional levels due to extensive travel between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries for economic and personal reasons as well as due to insecurity. The country is concurrently experiencing other epidemics (e.g. cholera, vaccine-derived poliomyelitis, malaria), and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the security situation in North Kivu and Ituri at times limits the implementation of response activities.As the risk of national and regional spread is very high, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities. The International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) Emergency Committee has advised that failing to intensify these preparedness and surveillance activities would lead to worsening conditions and further spread. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring countries and partners to ensure that health authorities are alerted and are operationally prepared to respond.",
        "WHO Advice": "International traffic: WHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for passengers leaving the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.",

        "Date Reported": "23 January 2019",
        "Location": "Argentina",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 19 December 2018, the Argentinian Ministry of Health and Social Development issued an epidemiological alert regarding an increase in cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in Epuy\u00e9n, Chubut Province. Between 28 October 2018 \u2013 20 January of 2019, a total of 29 laboratory-confirmed cases of HPS, including 11 deaths have been reported in Epuy\u00e9n, Chubut Province. Epuy\u00e9n has a population of approximately 2 000 persons, and Chubut Province is located in Patagonia in southern Argentina.The index case had environmental exposure prior to symptom onset on 2 November, and subsequently attended a party on 3 November. Six cases who also attended the party experienced the onset of symptoms between 20-27 November 2018. An additional 17 cases, all of whom were epidemiologically-linked to previously confirmed cases, experienced symptom onset between 7 December 2018 and 3 January 2019 (Figure 1). Potential human-to-human transmission is currently under investigation. Of the confirmed cases, 59% were female, and had an incubation period ranging from 8 to 31 days. Approximately 50% of these confirmed cases reported symptoms within the past three weeks. Cases were confirmed by ELISA IgM u-captura or by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). As of 17 January 2019, a total of 98 asymptomatic contacts have been identified and are being monitored for the potential development of symptoms. In Argentina, four endemic regions have been identified: North (Salta, Jujuy), Centro (Buenos Aires, Santa Fe, and Entre R\u00edos), Northeast (Misiones) and Sur (Neuqu\u00e9n, R\u00edo Negro, and Chubut). Between 2013 and 2018, an average of 100 confirmed cases were registered annually, with the provinces of Buenos Aires, Salta, and Jujuy having the highest numbers of cases. Between 2013 and 2018, 114 confirmed deaths from hantavirus were reported in Argentina, with a case-fatality rate of 18.6%, though this figure was close to 40% for some provinces in the southern region of the country. In Chile, one of the confirmed cases was a healthcare worker who resides in Palena Province, Los Lagos Region, and reported experiencing symptoms on 2 January 2019. The case had a travel history to Epuy\u00e9n for one day in mid-November, and later hosted and cared for a confirmed case from Epuy\u00e9n while she was in her prodromal phase. This is the first confirmed case of hantavirus in Los Lagos Region in 2019. During 2018, there were eight cases of hantavirus reported in Chile, including two deaths.Figure 1. Distribution of confirmed cases of HPS by week of symptom onset in Epuy\u00e9n, Chubut Province, Argentina.Source: Published by the Ministry of Health of Chubut Province and reproduced by PAHO/WHO",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "Health authorities in Argentina and Chile are implementing the following public health measures:Enhanced surveillance and active case finding including increase local diagnostic capacities for hantavirus for early diagnosisDaily follow-up of contactsDeployments of multi-disciplinary teams to the affected areas for outbreak investigationEnvironmental control measuresConduct risk communication activities; including educational awareness and health promotion in the communities and in healthcare facilitiesImplementation of infection prevention and control measuresSafe case management of HPS patient in dedicated health care facilities",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "HPS is a zoonotic, viral respiratory disease. The causative agent belongs to the genus\u00a0Hantavirus, family\u00a0Bunyaviridae. The infection is acquired primarily through inhalation of aerosols or contact with infected rodent excreta, droppings, or saliva of infected rodents. Cases of human hantavirus infection usually occur in rural areas (e.g. forests, fields, and farms) where sylvatic rodents hosting the virus might be found and where persons may be exposed to the virus. This disease is characterized by headache, dizziness, chills fever, myalgia, and gastrointestinal problems, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, followed by sudden onset of respiratory distress and hypotension. Symptoms of HPS typically occur from two to four weeks after initial exposure to the virus. However, symptoms may appear as early as one week and as late as eight weeks following exposure. The case-fatality rate can reach 35-50%.In the Americas, HPS cases have been reported in several countries. Environmental and ecological factors affecting rodent populations can have a seasonal impact on disease trends. Since the reservoir for hantavirus is sylvatic rodents, mainly\u00a0Sigmodontinae\u00a0species, transmission can occur when people come in contact with the rodent habitat. Limited human-to-human transmission of HPS due to\u00a0Andes virus\u00a0in Argentina has been previously documented. There are no specific evidence-based procedures for HPS patient isolation. Standard precautions1\u00a0should always be put in place, as well as rodent control measures.",
        "WHO Advice": "PAHO/WHO recommends that Member States continue efforts of detection, investigation, reporting, and case management for the prevention and control of infections caused by hantavirus.Particular attention should be paid towards travelers returning from the affected areas. Early identification and timely medical care greatly improves clinical outcomes. To raise awareness regarding potential HPS cases, clinicians should consult epidemiological data for guidance of the possible exposure, and be vigilant of patients presenting with suspicious clinical signs and symptoms such as fever, myalgia, and thrombocytopenia.Care during the initial stages of the disease should include antipyretics and analgesics as needed. In some situations, patients should receive broad-spectrum antibiotics while confirming the etiologic agent. Given the rapid progression of HPS, clinical management should focus on monitoring the patient's hemodynamic status, fluid management, and ventilation support. Severe cases should be immediately transferred to intensive care units (ICU).Ribavirin, an antiviral agent, is not approved for either treatment or prophylaxis of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome infection.Health awareness campaigns must aim to increase detection and timely treatment of the illness and prevent its occurrence by reducing people\u2019s exposure. Preventive measures should cover occupational and eco-tourism related hazards. Most usual tourism activities pose little or no risk of exposure of travelers to rodents or their excreta. However, people who engage in outdoor activities such as camping or hiking, should take precautions to reduce possible exposure to potentially infectious materials.HPS surveillance should be part of a comprehensive national surveillance system and must include clinical, laboratory and environmental components. The implementation of integrated environmental management, with the goal of reducing rodent populations, is recommended.",

        "Location": "Madagascar",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "WHO is supporting the Ministry of Public Health of Madagascar to respond to an unusually large measles outbreak. Madagascar last experienced measles outbreaks in 2003 and 2004, with reported number of cases at 62 233 and 35 558, respectively. Since then, the number of reported cases had sharply declined until the current outbreak. From 4 October 2018 to 7 January 2019, 19 539 measles cases and 39 \u201cfacility-based\u201d deaths (case fatality ratio: 0.2%) have been reported by the Ministry of Public Health (MoH) of Madagascar. Cases were reported from 66 of 114 total districts in all 22 regions of Madagascar. Among the 19 539 measles cases, 375 have been laboratory confirmed (all are IgM+) and 19 164 were confirmed by epidemiological link. Cases confirmed by epidemiological link are those who presented clinical symptoms based on the case definition and had been in contact with another laboratory confirmed or epidemiologically linked case. The outbreak has spread to densely populated urban cities including Toamasina, Mahajanga, Antsirabe, Toliara and the capital city Antananarivo. Most cases were reported from Analamanga (61%) and Boeny (20%) regions. The highest attack rates were observed in Antananarivo-Renivohitra district (714 per 100 000 inhabitants), and Ambato-Boina district (668 per 100 000 inhabitants), in Analamanga and Mahajanga regions, respectively. These rates are considerably higher compared to the national attack rate of 108 per 100 000 inhabitants.In the current epidemic, children aged 1 to 14 years account for 64% of the total number of cases. The age distribution in this group is as follows: under five years at 35%, 5-9 years at 22% and 10-14 years at 19%. Both sexes are equally affected with a male to female ratio of 1.04. The national immunization programme recommends routine measles immunization for children aged nine months. According to WHO and the United Nations International Children\u2019s Emergency Fund (UNICEF), the estimated measles immunization coverage in Madagascar was 58% in 2017. More than half of the cases (51%) reported during the current outbreak have not been vaccinated or have unknown immunization status. Madagascar has the highest proportion of malnutrition among children under five (47%) in the African region which can increase children's risk of serious complications and death from measles infection. The circulating genotype for the current measles outbreak in Madagascar is B3, usually found in Africa and Europe. No measles cases with travel history to Madagascar, however, have been reported in neighboring countries and initial investigations in Madagascar have not shown any link with cases from countries with measles outbreak in the Africa region or Europe.The measles outbreak has occurred concurrently with the resurgence of plague in the country\u2014which reoccurs seasonally\u2014straining the public health response.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "The Ministry of Public Health of Madagascar is coordinating the response activities, with the support of WHO and other partners. Public Health response measures include:Enhancement of active surveillance (active case finding, community-based surveillance, distribution of specimen collection kits) in all affected districts.Use of the Global Measles Programmatic Risk Assessment Tool to target priority districts for vaccination.Completion of targeted vaccination campaigns:Campaign conducted from 22 October to 9 November 2018 in four districts of Antanavarivo city. The campaign targeted at least 95% of children aged between nine and 59 months. Preliminary results show coverage of 84% of the targeted population.Campaign planned from 14 to 18 January targeting 2 083 734 children aged between nine months and nine years in 25 districts across 13 regions. The campaign is being funded by Measles Rubella Initiative (MRI), the Government of Madagascar, WHO, UNICEF, Catholic Relief Services (CRS), Commission de l'Oc\u00e9an Indien (COI), the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Embassy of France in Madagascar and the World Bank and the total cost is US$ 2 355 989.Reinforcement of routine immunization (one dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV) as per the national immunization programme) for children aged between nine and 11 months.Continued management of severe measles cases in referral hospitals, provided to patients free of charge. Vitamin A is being administered to patients under care in all referral and district health centres.Continued community mobilization with the support of UNICEF and USAID, aiming to increase understanding of the disease as well as uptake of the vaccines from campaigns and routine vaccination.Reactivation by USAID of the 910 hotline, formerly used during the 2017 plague epidemic, for information sharing on measles.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Measles is an acute, highly contagious viral disease that has potential to lead to major epidemics. Low coverage with measles vaccine combined with a low incidence of measles in recent years in Madagascar has contributed to a significant proportion of the population which is susceptible to measles. According to WHO and UNICEF estimates, the measles immunization coverage in Madagascar was 58% in 2017. The malnutrition rate is also a contributor as malnutrition increases children's vulnerability of serious complications and death from measles infection.WHO estimates the overall risk for Madagascar from this measles outbreak to be very high. Currently, several concomitant factors are likely to hinder or delay public health intervention and might jeopardize the response: post-election conflict, geographical isolation and remoteness of cases, insecurity, hurricane season and multiple outbreaks. Targeted immunization campaigns and strengthening of routine immunization activities are paramount in the effective control of the outbreak. Administration of Vitamin A, specifically in a context of high rates of malnutrition, can reduce illness and deaths from measles infection.The risk at the regional level is low although the spread of measles to neighboring Indian Ocean islands and other African countries and Europe cannot be excluded. Strengthening of surveillance in neighboring countries is recommended. The overall global risk is considered to be low.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO urges all Member States to:Vaccinate to maintain coverage of 95% with two doses of MCV.Vaccinate at-risk populations (without proof of vaccination or immunity against measles and rubella), such as health workers, people working in tourism and transportation (hotel and catering, airports, taxi drivers, etc.), and international travelers.Maintain a reserve of MCV and syringes for control of imported cases in each country in the region.Strengthen epidemiological surveillance of fever or rash cases for timely detection of all suspected cases of measles in public and private healthcare facilities and ensure that samples are received by laboratories within five days of being taken.Provide a rapid response to imported measles cases through the activation of rapid response teams to prevent the establishment or reestablishment of endemic transmission.Administer vitamin A supplementation to all children diagnosed with measles to reduce the complications and mortality (50,000 IU for a child less than 6 months of age, 100,000 IU for children 6-12 months of age or 200,000 IU for children 12-59 months); two doses, immediately upon diagnosis and on the following day).WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel and or trade to Madagascar based on the information available on the current outbreak.",

        "Description of the Situation": "The Ministry of Health (MoH), WHO and partners continue to respond to the ongoing Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in one of the most complex settings possible. A high number of cases are still being reported, most notably from the metropolitan areas of Katwa Health Zone during the past week. The decline in case incidence has continued in Beni; a positive indication of how effective the response can be despite multiple challenges.Trends in the number of new cases occurring (Figure 1) reflect the continuation of the outbreak across a number of geographically dispersed areas. During the last 21 days (26 December 2018 through 15 January 2019), 79 new cases have been reported from 11 health zones (Figure 2), including: Katwa (36), Oicha (14), Butembo (11), Beni (4), Mabalako (4), Kalungata (3), Kyondo (3), Komanda (1), Musienene (1), Biena (1) and Manguredjipa (1). The latter is a newly affected health zone, although the case likely acquired the infection in Mabalako Health Zone. As of 15 January 2019, there have been a total of 663 EVD cases 1(614 confirmed and 49 probable), including 407 deaths (overall case fatality ratio: 61%). Thus far, 237 people have been discharged from Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs) and enrolled in a dedicated program for monitoring and supporting survivors. Among confirmed and probable cases with age and sex reported, 59% (391/661) were female and 30% (200/658) were children less than 18 years. This includes a high number of cases in infants aged less than one year (43) and 1-4 years (61).All alerts in affected areas, in other provinces, and in neighbouring countries continue to be monitored and investigated. Since the last report was published, alerts were investigated in several provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda and Rwanda. To date, EVD has been ruled out in all alerts outside the outbreak affected areas.

        "WHO Risk Assessment": "WHO reviewed its risk assessment for the outbreak and the risk remains very high at the national and regional levels; the global risk level remains low. This outbreak of EVD is affecting north-eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo bordering Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan. There is a potential risk for transmission of EVD at the national and regional levels due to extensive travel between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries for economic and personal reasons as well as due to insecurity. The country is concurrently experiencing other epidemics (e.g. cholera, vaccine-derived poliomyelitis, malaria), and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the security situation in North Kivu and Ituri at times limits the implementation of response activities.As the risk of national and regional spread is very high, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities. The International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) Emergency Committee has advised that failing to intensify these preparedness and surveillance activities would lead to worsening conditions and further spread. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring countries and partners to ensure that health authorities are alerted and are operationally prepared to respond.",

Details of these cases can be found in a separate document (see link below).MERS-CoV cases reported between 1 December and 31 December 2018xls, 115kb\nFrom 2012 through 31 December 2018, the total number of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases reported globally to WHO under IHR (2005) is 2 279 with 806 associated deaths. The total number of deaths includes the deaths that WHO is aware of to date through follow-up with affected Member States.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease resulting in high mortality. Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedary camels. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings.\nThe notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to dromedary camels, animal products (for example, consumption of camel\u2019s raw milk), or humans (for example, in a health care setting). WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.",
        "WHO Advice": "Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, healthcare workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.MERS-CoV appears to cause more severe disease in people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to. Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "WHO and partners continue to respond to the ongoing Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in one of the most complex settings possible. A decline in case incidence has been seen in Beni, the former epicentre. This is a strong positive indication of how effective the response can be despite multiple challenges. However, in Beni and elsewhere, trends must be interpreted cautiously, as delayed detection of cases is expected following recent temporary disruption in response activities due to insecurity. Nevertheless, WHO and partners remain committed, under the government\u2019s leadership and through collaboration across agencies, to addressing challenges and ending the outbreak.As of 8 January 2019, there have been a total of 628 EVD cases1 (580 confirmed and 48 probable), including 383 deaths (overall case fatality ratio: 61%). Thus far, 222 people have recovered, been discharged from an Ebola Treatment Centre (ETC) and enrolled in a dedicated program for monitoring and supporting survivors. During the last 21 days (19 December 2018 to 8 January 2019), cases have been reported from ten health zones where the outbreak remains active, including: Katwa (18), Butembo (16), Oicha (13), Beni (13), Kalungata (6), Mabalako (5), Komanda (3), Musienene (2), Kyondo (1) and Nyankunde (1). Overall, cases have occurred in localised hotspots within 16 health zones found in North Kivu and Ituri provinces (Figure 1). Surveillance activities are being maintained to rapidly detect resurgences or reintroduction events in all areas. Trends in numbers of new cases occurring (Figure 2) reflect the continuation of the outbreak across these geographically dispersed areas, with encouraging declines in case incidence in areas such as Beni. Hard-earned progress could still be lost from prolonged periods of insecurity hampering containment efforts.Amongst confirmed and probable EVD cases, 61% (385/628) were female and 30% (189/628) were children aged less than 18 years. This includes a high number of cases in infants aged less than 1 year (38) and 1-4 years (58). While investigations to understand the risk factors for this disproportionate burden are ongoing, response teams continue to prioritise these population groups to mitigate, wherever possible, the risk of transmission. All alerts in affected areas, in other provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and in neighbouring countries continue to be monitored and investigated. Since the last report was published, alerts were investigated in several provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, South Sudan, Rwanda and in a traveller returning from Burundi to Sweden. To date, EVD has been ruled out in all alerts outside the outbreak affected areas. International travellers who may have come into contact with the virus, including a doctor who returned to the United States of America after providing medical assistance in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, are also being followed closely; all remain asymptomatic.

        "Date Reported": "9 January 2019",
        "Location": "Nigeria",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 22 November 2018, the World Health Organization was informed of a cluster of suspected Yellow fever (YF) cases and deaths in Edo State, Nigeria. Edo State is located less than 400km from Lagos on a dense population movement axis between Lagos and South-Eastern Nigeria. Edo State is also a known endemic area for Lassa fever \u2013 which was initially suspected as causing the outbreak. From 22 September through 31 December 2018, a total of 146 suspected, 42 presumptive positive, and 32 confirmed cases, including 26 deaths (presumptive case fatality rate: 18%), have been reported across 15 of 18 Local Government Areas (LGAs) in Edo State (figure 1).Blood specimens were obtained from 122 cases and sent for laboratory diagnosis; 42 (34%) samples were presumptive positive in-country based on IgM serology and sent to the regional reference laboratory, Institut Pasteur de Dakar (IPD), for confirmation. Thirty-two (76%) were confirmed by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) or real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Males represent the majority of cases (108 of 146, 74%), and the most affected age group is 10\u201319 years with 48 cases (33%), followed by the age group 20\u201329 with 36 cases (25%). Initially, the affected LGAs were rural but since the end of November 2018, suspected cases have been reported from three urban LGAs. There has also been a report of two presumptive positive and one confirmed case in Oredo LGA, which includes the densely populated state capital Benin City, of about 1.5 million inhabitants.At the time of the outbreak, population immunity in Edo State was very low, (based solely on routine immunisation administrative data, with vaccine coverage estimated at less than 50% in 2018). Edo State has just concluded a seven-day YF Reactive Vaccination Campaign implementation in 13 LGAs to rapidly boost population immunity and interrupt YF transmission. As of 31 December 2018, 1.47 million people have been vaccinated.Entomological studies have revealed elevated indices of competent vectors, including Aedes aegypti, the mosquito species responsible for rapid amplification of arboviral disease in urban environments. Land-use practices, namely cultivation close to dwellings, may further exacerbate the spread of YF disease in this setting.Since September 2017, when the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) informed WHO of a confirmed case of YF in Kwara State, Nigeria has been responding to successive YF outbreaks. The country officially notified WHO (via the International Health Regulations, 2005) on 15 September 2017. Since then, and as of 30 December 2018, 237 specimens tested IgM positive in-country. Eighty-two cases (including 13 deaths) were confirmed by IPD; these cases were reported from 27 LGAs in 14 States and have resulted in response campaigns in selected LGAs in six states. The current outbreak of YF in Edo State in Nigeria is unusual in scale and severity, and the number of cases in time and place is very high in the context of the current national outbreak. The seasonal timing of the outbreak, in a period where many travellers enter the state from other states and countries for the holidays in December\u2013January, adds to the risk for potential spread.Figure 1: Confirmed and suspected Yellow fever cases in Edo State outbreak, Nigeria, data as of 31 December 2018 (n=146)Public health responseThe response to the outbreak is being coordinated through a multi-agency, multi-partner Incident Management System (IMS). A national Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) has been activated to monitor the outbreak at the NCDC. Rapid response teams continue to support Edo State in ongoing outbreak investigation and response. YF surveillance has been intensified and active case finding is ongoing in affected LGAs and neighbouring states. Supervisory visits to the YF laboratory network are ongoing to strengthen laboratory capacity.The WHO Country Office and State Office have been actively monitoring and responding to the YF outbreak since the start of the outbreak. From 15 December 2018, three YF experts from WHO (WHO Regional Office for Africa and WHO headquarters) were deployed to support local authorities in investigating this event, assessing the risk of further amplification, and assisting in conducting reactive vaccination campaigns, among other activities. Entomological surveys were conducted in Anambra, Benue, Ekiti, Kano, Katsina, Kebbi, Kwara, Rivers, and Zamfara states by entomologists from the National Arbovirus Research Institute (NARI). A vector control strategy, tailored to the local context, is being developed with the support of WHO regional and global vector control experts.Routine YF vaccination was introduced to Nigeria\u2019s Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) in 2004, but the overall population immunity in areas affected by the current outbreak remains below herd immunity thresholds. National preventive and reactive mass vaccination campaigns have been conducted in the country since 2017 (~33 million doses). A proposal has been submitted to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance to vaccinate twelve states over the next three years (~23 million doses). The International Coordination Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision, funded by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance approved release of 3.1 million doses of YF vaccines. The country initiated a large scale reactive yellow fever vaccination campaign in Edo State on 18 December, initially using in-country vaccine stocks which were mobilised to facilitate a timely response before the holidays.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "YF is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes and has the potential to spread rapidly and cause serious public health impact. There is no specific treatment, although the disease is preventable using a single dose of yellow fever vaccine, which provides immunity for life. Supportive care to treat dehydration, respiratory failure and fever and antibiotic treatment for associated bacterial infections is recommended.The YF outbreak has been active in Nigeria since September 2017. Cases are reported from 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory. The recent confirmation by the regional reference laboratory of the YF outbreak in Edo State, with the probable epicentre in Uhunmwonde LGA, represents an unprecedented outbreak in Nigeria. Given the rapid evolution of the situation in Edo State, the national risk is assessed as high due to: the high presumptive case fatality rate (33%) in Edo State; the potential for ongoing local transmission and amplification due to low vaccination coverage; presence of competent vectors including Aedes sp.; the proximity of a case to Benin City (major urban centre and capital of Edo State); and the potential spread to new LGAs.There is currently a moderate risk at regional level due to the possible movement of the individuals of affected states to adjacent areas and neighbouring countries and particularly if there is arrival of unvaccinated visitors over the festive end of year season. The current overall risk is low at the global level.Nigeria is facing several concurrent public health emergencies, including cholera, circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus, monkey pox, measles, and Lassa fever outbreaks in other states, and a humanitarian crisis in the northeast of the country.",
        "WHO Advice": "Nigeria is a high priority country for the Eliminate Yellow Fever Epidemic (EYE) strategy. Phased preventive YF vaccination campaigns are planned to cover the entire country by 2024. Vaccination is the primary intervention for prevention and control of YF. In urban centres, targeted vector control measures are also helpful to interrupt transmission. WHO and partners will continue to support local authorities to implement these interventions to control the current outbreak.WHO recommends vaccination against YF for all international travellers more than nine months of age going to Nigeria, as there is evidence of persistent or periodic YF virus transmission. Nigeria also requires a YF vaccination certificate for travellers over one year of age arriving from countries with risk of yellow fever transmission.YF vaccines recommended by WHO are safe, highly effective and provide life-long protection against infection. In accordance with the IHR (2005), Third edition, the validity of the international certificate of vaccination against YF extends to the life of the person vaccinated with a WHO approved vaccine. A booster dose of approved YF vaccine cannot be required of international travellers as a condition of entry.WHO encourages its Member States to take all actions necessary to keep travellers well informed of risks and preventive measures including vaccination. Travellers should also be made aware of YF symptoms and signs and instructed to seek rapid medical advice should they develop signs of illness. Viraemic returning travellers may pose a risk for the establishment of local cycles of YF transmission in areas where the competent vector is present.WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel or trade to Nigeria on the basis of the information available on this outbreak.",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "The response by WHO and partners to the ongoing Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak continues despite disruptions to key services due to security incidents taking place in Beni and Butembo during the recent election on 30 December 2018. In order to ensure the safety of all staff deployed, as a precautionary measure, operations were scaled back for a few hours on election day. All normal operations have been fully restored as of 1 January 2019. After an intensification of field activities in early December, notable improvements can be observed in many areas, notably a decrease in cases in Beni. However, hard-earned progress could still be lost to rebound levels of transmission resulting from prolonged periods of insecurity hampering containment efforts.During the reporting period (27 December 2018 \u2013 2 January 2019), 16 newly confirmed cases were reported from Beni (two), Butembo (five), Katwa (three), Komanda (one), Mabalako (one), and Oicha (four) health zones (Figure 1). As of 2 January 2019, there have been a total of 609 EVD cases1 (561 confirmed and 48 probable, Figure 2), including 370 deaths and 208 people having recovered. Overall, cases are occurring in localised hotspots within 16 health zones found in North Kivu and Ituri. Amongst confirmed and probable cases, the case load has been highest in females aged 15-49 who are eligible for vaccination (i.e. non-pregnant), and also females aged 50 years and older (Figure 3). Amongst confirmed and probable cases, 61% (374/609) were female (median age = 28) and were predominantly older than male cases (median age = 25.5). Of note, 16% (96/607) of cases were among children less than five years old, and 7% (41/607) were infants less than one year old. Most of the cases among children aged five years old or more were from Beni, 48% (46/96). There were 29 cases among pregnant women, of which 14 were from Beni. Fifteen of the 29 cases were reportedly breastfeeding women.As of 2 January, a total of 86 cases of nosocomial infection were reported in patients from the general public, primarily from Beni (34), Butembo (13), Katwa (11) and Mabalako (eight). There have been no new cases in healthcare workers during this reporting period. To date, there have been a total of 55 EVD cases involving healthcare workers, of which 18 have died and eight were hospitalised as patients. Of the healthcare workers with available clinical information, 36% (18/50) died. Eleven healthcare workers were reportedly infected in a general hospital while the other 30 health facilities reported between one to three cases each during the entire outbreak period. It should be noted that 22% (133/609) of all cases had history of exposure to a hospital 1-21 days prior to the onset of their illness. Thorough contact tracing during initial case investigations remains difficult in light of continued community resistance and the deteriorating security situation in the field during the recent elections. This resulted in a number of new confirmed cases not being identified as potential contacts. Of all cases, 66% (327/495) had known contact with a case, and 37% (177/478) had attended a funeral. A sizeable proportion of cases, 34% (155/451), had both these exposures.The Ministry of Health (MoH), WHO and partners continue to monitor and investigate all alerts in affected areas, in other provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and in neighbouring countries. Since the last report was published, alerts were investigated in several provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo as well as in Uganda. To date, EVD has been ruled out in all alerts outside of the above mentioned outbreak affected areas.Figure 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by health zone in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo, data as of 2 January 2019 (n=609)Figure 2: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by week of illness onset, data as of 2 January 2019 (n=609)Figure 3: Ebola virus disease cases by age groups in Northern Kivu and Ituri, Democratic Republic of the Congo, data as of 2 January 2019",

WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.",

        "Date Reported": "4 January 2019",
        "Location": "Panama",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "The Panama Ministry of Health has reported an increase in cases of hantavirus infection in Los Santos Province, Republic of Panama, to the Pan American Health Organization / World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO). Between 1 January and 22 December 2018, a total of 103 confirmed cases of hantavirus have been reported at the national level, 99 of which were reported in Los Santos Province. In Los Santos Province, 51 cases were classified as hantavirus fever1 (HF) without pulmonary syndrome and 48 cases were classified as hantavirus pulmonary syndrome2 (HPS), including four deaths. Of the 51 HF cases, 41% were female, 55% aged between 20-59 years, with 76% occurring between June 2018 and November 2018. Of the 48 HPS cases, 56% were female, 67% aged between 20-59 years, with more than half of the cases occurring in February 2018 (17%) and between June 2018 and September 2018 (42%). Four deaths were reported among HPS cases (two female, two male, all aged over 60 years). Cases were confirmed by serology and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)3. Sequencing determined that the type of virus associated with this outbreak is Choclo virus. It was first isolated in 1999 in the western Republic of Panama.Hantavirus cases have been reported in the Republic of Panama since 1999 (Figure 1). In the last five years, transmission has been documented in Los Santos, Herrera, Veraguas, and Cocle provinces. During 2018, cases have been reported in Los Santos (99 cases, Figure 2), Herrera (two cases), Cocle (one case) and Veraguas (one case) provinces (Figure 3). Since the reservoir for hantavirus is sylvatic rodents and transmission can occur when people come in contact with rodent habitats, the current increase in hantavirus cases in the Republic of Panama could be related to changes in the abundance and distribution of rodent species, as well as strengthened surveillance and laboratory capacity at the provincial level. Environmental and ecological factors affecting rodent populations can have a seasonal impact on disease trends. Figure 1.

        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "The public health responses currently being implemented include:Investigation and monitoring of cases, including case management.Enhanced surveillance and active case finding.Rodent control and mitigation measures.Increasing awareness and health promotion in the affected areas.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "HPS is a zoonotic, viral respiratory disease. The causative agent belongs to the genus\u00a0Hantavirus, family\u00a0Bunyaviridae. Infections are acquired primarily through inhalation of aerosols or contact with the excreta, droppings or saliva of infected rodents. Cases of human hantavirus infection usually occur in rural areas (forests, fields, farms, etc.), where rodents hosting the virus might be found. Infected individuals may experience headache, dizziness, chills, fever and myalgia. They may also experience gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pains, and diarrhoea, followed by sudden onset of respiratory distress and hypotension. Symptoms of HPS typically occur from two to four weeks after initial exposure, though symptoms may appear as early as one week to as late as eight weeks following exposure. The case fatality rate can reach 50%.In the Americas, HPS cases have been reported in several countries. In January 2019, World Youth Day4\u00a0will be hosted in the Republic of Panama. This mass gathering will take place predominantly in Panama City, while side events will occur in other provinces5. Though a seasonal increase of hantavirus during the month of January has not been previously documented, increases in cases have been related to outdoor and agricultural activities in rural environments. Nevertheless, participants to the World Youth Day should be provided with recommendations and guidance on how to take appropriate precautionary measures to reduce their risk of infection. Health awareness campaigns for health personnel and the general public are planned for the coming weeks. Organisers and public health authorities should collaborate with travel and tourism sectors in placing educational materials and appropriate signage at strategic locations and points of entry (e.g. airports, public transport stations, travel agent offices). Alternative forms of media including public service announcements on planes, ships and public radio should also be considered.Based on current epidemiological data and public health response, WHO\u2019s risk assessment is that there is no significant risk of international spread of HPS in relation to this event.",
        "WHO Advice": "PAHO/WHO recommends that Member States continue efforts of detection, investigation, reporting, and case management for the prevention and control of infections caused by hantavirus.Particular attention should be paid to travellers returning from the affected areas, who are advised to report their travel history, as early identification and timely medical care can improve clinical outcomes.Care during the initial stages of the illness should include antipyretics and analgesics as needed. In some situations, patients should receive broad-spectrum antibiotics while confirming the etiologic agent. Given the rapid progression of HPS, clinical management should focus on the patient's haemodynamic monitoring, fluid management, and ventilation support. Severe cases should be immediately transferred to intensive care units (ICUs).Health awareness campaigns should aim to increase detection and timely treatment of the illness and prevent its occurrence by reducing people\u2019s contact with rodents. Preventive measures should cover occupational and eco-tourism related hazards. While most usual tourism activities pose little or no risk of exposing travellers to rodents or their excreta, people who engage in outdoor activities such as camping or hiking should take precautions to reduce possible exposure to potentially infectious materials.HPS surveillance should be part of a comprehensive national surveillance system and must include clinical, laboratory and environmental components. WHO recommends the implementation of integrated environmental management, with the goal of reducing rodent populations. Throughout the World Youth Day event, syndromic surveillance may alert public authorities to increased influenza-like and GI symptoms among mass gathering participants.At this time, WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel and/or trade to the Republic of Panama based on available information for the current hantavirus outbreak.",
