        "Description of the Situation": "23 December 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported\n\n Summary\n\n(Week 50, 7 December - 13 December 2003)\n\nInfluenza activity associated with influenza A(H3N2) viruses continues to increase in Africa (Tunisia), Europe (Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Norway, Russia, Switzerland, Russia Federation and Ukraine) and North America (the United States), and persists in France and some parts of Canada. In other European countries (Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom) and most parts of Canada, activity has declined.\n\nMost influenza infections this season have been attributed to influenza A(H3N2) viruses. The majority of viruses antigenically characterized so far have been shown to be A/Fujian/411/2002-like; the rest have been A/Panama/2007/99-like. There have been few reports of influenza A/Fujian/411/2002-like virus detections from Asia. Influenza A(H1) and B viruses have also been detected in some countries. Both B/Hong Kong/330/2001-like and B/Sichuan/379/99-like viruses have been identified. The hemagglutinins of all influenza A(H1) viruses characterized so far have been A/New Caledonia/20/99-like.\n\nAn avian influenza A(H5N1) outbreak in poultry in a chicken farm in the Republic of Korea was reported on Tuesday 16 December. The outbreak was recognized by the death of about 19 000 chickens. Surviving chickens in the affected farm were slaughtered. As of Monday 22 December 2003, nine poultry farms in 4 provinces were found to be infected by avian influenza. About one million chickens and ducks are to be culled. The A(H5N1) strain isolated is being examined to determine its relation to other influenza A(H5N1) viruses, which emerged in Asia recently. So far no human A(H5N1) cases have been reported.\n\nAdditional investigation of a recent influenza A(H9N2) case in Hong Kong SAR China is on going to determine the source of infection. Virus isolates have been sent to the WHO Collaborating Centers for Reference and Research on Influenza  for sequencing and antigenic makeup characterising to update the diagnostic reagents available for National Influenza Centers. So far all further results of investigation appear to confirm the initial findings that this is an isolated case.\n\nFor previous update For more information:WHO Influenza web site\n\nCanada. During week 50, widespread activity of influenza was reported in British Columbia and Ontario, while localised or sporadic activity was reported in most of other parts of Canada. The influenza-like illness (ILI) consultation rate was 52 cases per 1000 consultations, which is below the baseline. During this week, 17% of 3983 laboratory tests were positive for influenza A and no influenza B virus was detected. Of the 294 influenza viruses antigenically characterized by the National Microbiology Laboratory to date, 267 (91%) were A/Fujian/411/2002-like, 25 (8.5%) were A/Panama/2007/99-like, one was an A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1)-like virus and one was A(H1N2).\n\nCzech Republic. An increase of influenza A(H3N2) activity was first noted in week 48. In week 50, localised activity of influenza was reported with 8 influenza A viruses detected. \n\nDenmark. Influenza activity continued to increase in week 50 and was reported as localised with 7 influenza A viruses detected. The ILI consultation rate was above the baseline level, but below the epidemic threshold for this time of the year. All viruses isolated so far have been confirmed to be A/Fujian/411/2002-like.\n\nFrance. Widespread activity of influenza A(H3N2) persisted in all regions in France except Languedoc-Roussillon.\n\nItaly. Sporadic cases of A(H3N2) were identified in week 50 with a slight increasing trend of increase in influenza activity.\n\n Norway. Widespread Iinfluenza activity was reported as widespread ofin week 50 for the fourth consecutive week. Overall incidence of ILI continued to increase with a large proportion in the 0-4 year age group. While influenza A(H3) activity was reported throughout the country, A(H1) activity was confined to south-east Norway. All influenza A(H3) viruses antigenically characterized so far were A/Fujian/411/2002-like.\n\nPortugal. A decrease in influenza activity, first observed in week 48, continued in week 50, although activity remained widespread. Of the influenza viruses characterized so far this season, the majority were A/Fujian/411/2002-like.\n\nRussian Federation. Regional influenza activity associated mainly with influenza A(H3N2) was observed to be increasing in week 50 with 25 influenza A(H3N2) viruses isolated. Sporadic cases of influenza A(H1N1) and B were also detected. Weekly morbidity was 0.69%-1.5% for the whole population.\n\nSpain. Influenza activity continued to decline in week 50 with an ILI consultation rate of 117 cases per 100000 population. Localised activity of influenza was reported in the Castilla y Le\u00f3n autonomic community with 2 influenza A(H3) and 3 A non-subtyped viruses detected.\n\nSwitzerland. In week 50 activity of influenza A(H3N2) continued to increase and was reported as widespread with 8 influenza A viruses detected. All influenza A(H3) viruses antigenically characterized so far are A/Fujian/411/2002-like.\n\nUkraine. Localised influenza activity continued to increase in week 50. The overall weekly ILI incidence increased by 9% compared with week 49, while the incidence in children increased by 23% -35% in some cities.\n\nUnited Kingdom. In week 50, influenza activity declined in all countries in the UK. The ILI consultation rate was within the baseline activity range in England and Wales, while in Scotland, it was at the normal seasonal level. During week 50, 57 influenza A(H3) viruses were detected. Of the viruses antigenically characterized, 55 have been confirmed as A/Fujian/411/2002-like, 3 as A/Panama/2007/99-like and 2 as B/Hong Kong/330/2001-like.\n\nUnited States. Influenza activity continued to increase during week 50. The overall ILI consultation rate was 7.4%, which is above the national baseline of 2.5%. Widespread influenza activity was reported in 36 states and regional activity was reported in 12 states and New York City during week 50; 35.8% of the specimens tested were positive for influenza with 1342 influenza A viruses and 23 B viruses identified. Since week 40, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta have antigenically characterized 2 influenza A(H1) viruses, 265 A(H3N2) viruses and 2 B viruses from the U.S.. Of the 265 A(H3N2) viruses characterized, 62 (23%) are A/Panama/2007/99-like and 203 (77%) are A/Fujian/411/2002-like. The 2 A(H1) viruses are antigenically similar to A/New Caledonia/20/99-like virus and the 2 B viruses are similar to B/Sichuan/379/99-like virus.\n\nOther reports. Low influenza activity was reported in Austria, Chile, Hong Kong SAR China, Hungary, Iceland, India, Japan, Latvia, Thailand and Tunisia. Croatia, Madagascar and Poland reported no influenza activity.",

        "Description of the Situation": "17 December 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported\n\n Summary\n\nInfluenza activity associated with influenza A(H3N2) viruses continues to rise substantially in some countries in Europe (Finland, France, Norway, Russian Federation and Switzerland ) and North America (the USA), but has declined in Portugal and Spain and in some parts of Canada. In the United Kingdom (UK), the early increase in influenza activity appears to have stabilized, although the trend remains unclear. An increasing trend has also been observed in a number of other European countries (Denmark, Italy and Ukraine) where influenza activity currently remains low.\n\nMost influenza outbreaks so far this season have been attributed to influenza A(H3N2) viruses. Of viruses antigenically characterized so far, most have been A/Fujian/411/2002-like and the rest A/Panama/2007/99-like. So far, there have been very few reports of influenza A/Fujian/411/2002-like virus being detected in Asia.\n\nAccording to the UK Office for National Statistics, the number of deaths from all causes is about average for this time of year in the past five years. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta report that the proportion of deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza in the USA is below the \"epidemic threshold\" for the time of year.\n\nAn influenza A(H9N2) case was confirmed on 9 December 2003 by the Department of Health of Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region of China. This was a 5-year-old boy, hospitalized at the end of November with mild clinical symptoms and discharged 2 days later. It appears that this is an isolated case, with no evidence of further spread or of human-to-human transmission. Investigation continues. This is the second time that avian influenza A(H9N2) viruses have been isolated from humans in Hong Kong SAR. The first cases, detected in 1999, involved two girls who also made full recoveries after having influenza-like symptoms. Influenza A(H9N2) viruses have circulated among birds in the region over the past few years.\n\nFor previous update For more information:WHO Influenza web site\n\n Canada (6 December 2003).

        "Description of the Situation": "4 December 2003With an early start, influenza activity associated with influenza A(H3N2) viruses is being observed increasing significantly in some countries in Europe (France, Norway, Spain and Portugal) and North America (the USA). In Canada and the UK, weekly reported influenza activity has slightly declined but the trend remains unclear.\n\nThis season, respiratory deaths occurring young children have been reported in Canada, the UK and the USA, with 6 deaths in children in the UK confirmed to be in association with A/Fujian/411/2002-like virus. However according to the data from the Office for National Statistics in the UK, total respiratory deaths in young children are within expected levels to this point of the year.\n\nMost influenza outbreaks this season are attributed to influenza A(H3N2) virus. Most viruses antigenically characterized so far have been confirmed to be A/Fujian/411/2002-like, and the rest are A/Panama/2007/99-like. Sporadic cases of A(H1) and B have also been detected in some countries in the world.\n\nFor more information, please visit WHO influenza website \n\nCanada (22 November 2003) \n\nWidespread influenza activity was reported Saskatchewan and Ontario during week 47. Influenza outbreaks were reported in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, Ontario and Saskatchewan. Influenza-like illness (ILI) consultation rate was 21 cases per 1000 consultations, which is below the national baseline level for week 47. To date, of the 87 influenza viruses antigenically characterized by the National Microbiology Laboratory, 61 are A/Fujian/411/2002-like viruses, 25 are A/Panama/2007/99-like viruses and one is an A/New Caledonia/20/99-like virus.\n\nFrance (22 November 2003) \n\nIncreased influenza activity was observed. In week 47, regional activity of influenza A/Fujian/411/2002-like viruses was reported in 9 regions in France.\n\nIsrael (22 November 2003)\n\nActivity of influenza A(H3N2) viruses remained at a high level in weeks 46 and 47.\n\nItaly (22 November 2003)\n\nSo far this season, influenza activity has been below baseline. The first influenza virus, an A(H1) virus, was detected in week 47 in a 3 year old child.\n\nLatvia (22 November 2003) \n\nThe first influenza viruses of this season were three influenza A/Panama/2007/99-like viruses detected in week 47. Influenza activity remained low.\n\nNorway (22 November 2003)\n\nSubstantial increase of influenza activity was observed in week 47. The incidence rate of ILI exceeded the epidemic threshold during week 47 in four of the five health regions. While influenza A(H3) viruses were detected in all regions, A(H1N2) and B viruses were sporadically detected in south-east Norway.\n\nSpain (22 November 2003)\n\nInfluenza activity increased after week 45. In week 47, widespread influenza activity was reported with 20 influenza A(H3N2) and 16 A non-subtyped viruses detected.\n\nUnited Kingdom (22 November 2003)\n\nDuring week 47, the ILI consultation rate was 54.5, decreased from a rate of 62.2 per 100 000 population in week 46. A/Fujian/411/2002-like viruses have now been the most commonly identified influenza viruses in the UK and have been detected in all countries of the UK. Of the viruses antigenically characterized so far, 17 have been confirmed as A/Fujian/411/2002-like and 3 as A/Panama/2007/99-like.\n\nUnited States (22 November 2003)\n\nInfluenza activity continued to increase during week 47. Overall ILI consultation rate was 3.8%, which is above the national baseline of 2.5%. Widespread activity of influenza was reported in 10 states and regional activity was reported in 9 states for week 47. 34.3% of the specimens were positive for influenza. 1070 influenza A viruses and 6 B viruses were identified . Since week 40, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta have antigenically characterized 108 influenza A(H3N2) viruses, of which 19 (18%) are A/Panama/2007/99-like and 89 (82%) are A/Fujian/411/2002-like.\n\nOther reports.

        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "21 November 2003Since the beginning of October, outbreaks of influenza in a number of countries in Europe and North America have been due largely to A(H3N2) viruses; whereas, A(H1) viruses were responsible for outbreaks in Iceland. Influenza activity has continued to increase during November in Canada, Finland, France, Israel, Norway, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States of America (USA).\n\nIn Europe (Ireland, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland), most H3N2 viruses that have been characterized antigenically so far this season were A/Fujian/411/2002-like; in the UK, 2/3 of isolates characterized so far were A/Fujian/411/2002-like and one third were A/Panama/2007/99-like. In Canada, more than a half of the A(H3N2) isolates characterized so far are A/Fujian/411/2002-like, while the rest were A/Panama/2007/99-like. In the US, more than \u00be of the A(H3N2) isolates were A/Fujian/411/2002-like; the rest are A/Panama/2007/99-like.\n\nIn the last eight weeks, five deaths in children, two in England and three in Scotland, have been confirmed as due to A/Fujian/411/2002-like virus.\n\nA/Fujian/411/2002-like strains are drift variants of the A/Panama/2007/99 vaccine virus. Therefore antibodies produced against the A/Panama/2007/99-like strain(see WER 2003 78(9): 58-62 and WER 2003 87(11):77 ) do cross-react with A/Fujian/411/2002-like strains, but at a lower level.\n\nFor example, in laboratory tests of sera from recipients of influenza vaccines currently used in the northern hemisphere, there were on average 41% reductions in the post-immunization antibody titres to A/Fujian/411/2002-like strains, when compared with the A/Panama/2007/99 vaccine strain. However despite such reductions, the tests demonstrated that 76% of adult and 72% of the elderly vaccinees possessed protective levels of antibody(HI titres of >40) to A/Fujian/411/2002-like strains.\n\nFor more information, please review WHO Weekly Epidemiological Record",

        "Description of the Situation": "SARS case in Singapore linked to accidental laboratory contamination\n\n24 September 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported\n\nThe Singapore Ministry of Health has released the full report of an international investigation of a recent SARS case. The investigation, which followed laboratory confirmation on 8 September of SARS in a 27-year-old researcher, concluded that the patient most likely acquired the infection in a laboratory as the result of accidental contamination. The investigation found no evidence of further transmission and no reason to regard this single isolated case as a concern for international public health.\n\nThe case in Singapore marked the first case of SARS to be confirmed since the last known case in the world was detected and isolated in Taiwan, China, on 15 June. In addition to positive results in the laboratory tests for the SARS coronavirus, the SARS agent, subsequently confirmed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Singapore patient showed clinical signs consistent with a diagnosis of SARS.\n\nThe patient was conducting research on the West Nile virus in a laboratory that was also conducting research using active SARS coronavirus. The investigation concluded that cross-contamination of West Nile virus samples with the SARS virus in the laboratory was the source of infection. Both viruses were detected in a research specimen.\n\nThe genetic sequence of the SARS coronavirus isolated from the infected patient was found to be closely related to the sequence of the laboratory strain, further supporting the likelihood that infection was the result of accidental laboratory contamination.\n\nThe investigation was conducted by an 11-member panel including experts from Singapore, WHO Western Pacific Regional Office and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The investigation found no evidence that the patient was a carrier of the SARS virus, acquired during some past contact with a SARS patient, or that any other chain of person-to-person transmission was the cause of the infection. Research on the SARS virus in Singapore is conducted in biosafety level 3 facilities. However, the experts identified several inappropriate laboratory practices that contributed to the accident, and made a series of recommendations for their correction. The laboratory where the accident occurred has been temporarily closed. The panel viewed the incident as an opportunity for Singapore to improve biosafety in its laboratories by introducing uniform standards of safety and improving the training of staff.\n\nBiosafety level 3 facilities are designed for work with Risk Group 3 microorganisms, as defined in the WHO Laboratory Biosafety Manual, Edition 2.5. Biosafety level 3 containment requires special engineering and design features as well as heightened safety standards and practices.\n\nThe possibility that a SARS outbreak could occur following a laboratory accident is a risk of considerable importance, given the relatively large number of laboratories currently conducting research using the SARS coronavirus or retaining specimens from SARS patients.\n\nThe investigation found that the case in Singapore was rapidly detected by surveillance procedures in place at Singapore General Hospital and appropriate clinical management and infection control practices were implemented. The swift detection of this case illustrates the importance of continued global vigilance for SARS. This is especially needed in areas that were affected by SARS, and in all institutions that have retained virus isolates and/or diagnostic specimens from SARS patients. It also highlights the importance of strict adherence to appropriate laboratory biosafety procedures and practices for work with communicable agents, such as the SARS coronavirus.\n\nThe full report of the review panel is available at:\n\nIn response to this incident and the findings of the review panel, WHO is currently evaluating its recommendations on the storage and handling of the SARS agent. A meeting of SARS experts and leaders in the field of biosafety will be convened in October 2003 to review the revised WHO biosafety guidelines for handling SARS coronavirus.\n\n\nBiosafety and SARS Incident in Singapore September 2003",

Systematic reporting of deaths from cholera has not been undertaken in health centres. WHO has put an emergency surveillance system in place to fill this gap. The first peak reached 935 cases during 7-13 July. The weekly average decreased by end July -early August, although the worsening security situation prevented cholera patients from attending health care facilities. Since the ceasefire and the improvement in security, the number of registered cases has been rapidly increasing. According to figures collected at cholera treatment centres in Monrovia, there were 727 registered cases during 4-10 August and 1203 cases during11-17 August.\nMore people are now returning to their homes or to refugee camps outside Monrovia; as a result, the cholera outbreak is spreading from central Monrovia to peripheral areas of the city and neighbouring districts.\nThere are approximately 230 000 people in internally displaced persons camps in Monrovia living in very difficult conditions. The sanitation is poor and safe water is scarce with only 2 litres per day per person available. In order to reduce the risk of waterborne diseases and to limit cholera transmission, WHO, in collaboration with UNICEF and other partners, has launched a campaign for the chlorination of water in Monrovia. The chlorination of 5000 open wells in the city has begun and the process will be repeated regularly until the cholera risk has diminished.\nNutrition screening carried out by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) found that 40 % of the children screened are suffering from acute malnutrition which may increase the rate of severe cholera cases. M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res France and Belgium and MERLIN have opened cholera treatment centres near the most affected areas. The Cholera Coordination Committee has been reactivated to ensure the effectiveness of the efforts of partners (Ministry of Health, WHO, NGOs) operating in Liberia during this post-war phase. In particular, NGOs have been encouraged to better inform the population on cholera preventive measures.",

        "Description of the Situation": "5 July\n\nWHO is today removing Taiwan from its list of areas with recent local transmission of SARS. This achievement means that all known chains of person-to-person transmission of the SARS virus have now been broken.\n\n\u201cWith the last known chain of transmission interrupted in Taiwan, the whole world can breathe an initial sigh of relief,\u201d said Dr David Heymann, the WHO Executive Director for communicable diseases. \u201cAt the same time, public health must not let down its guard, as more cases could still surface somewhere in the world. SARS has taught us that a single case is capable of igniting an outbreak.\u201d\n\n\u201cTaiwan was unlucky. A lapse in infection control in a single hospital allowed the outbreak, which had been under good control, to escalate. But the authorities reacted quickly and appropriately. In doing so, they have also strengthened capacity to deal with any future outbreaks.\u201d\n\nThe last reported probable case in Taiwan, and \u2013 for the moment \u2013 in the world, was detected and isolated on 15 June. Two consecutive 10-day incubation periods have now passed with no further cases detected.\n\nThe achievement comes just slightly more than four months since the virus began moving around the world, in late February, along the routes of international air travel.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s first case of SARS occurred in a 54-year-old businessman with a travel history, in late February, to Guangdong Province, China, where the earliest cases of SARS are now known to have occurred. The businessman was hospitalized on 8 March.\n\nTaiwan eventually had to cope with the third largest outbreak on record, including 674 cases and 84 deaths. The largest outbreaks occurred in mainland China (5327 cases and 348 deaths) and Hong Kong (1755 cases and 298 deaths).\n\nThe outbreak in Taiwan initially grew slowly, with only 23 probable cases detected in the first month. Of these, a single health care worker, a doctor, became infected when he treated the wife of the businessman. All of the earliest cases could be directly linked to close contact with a SARS patient, or had a history of recent travel to an area where local transmission was known to be occurring. Only 4 of the early cases resulted from secondary spread within Taiwan.\n\nThe outbreak began to escalate in mid-April following a lapse in infection control procedures, which allowed the disease to spread rapidly within the hospital setting and then into the wider community. In dealing with the emergency that followed, health authorities rapidly introduced a series of sweeping measures. The surveillance system was upgraded and began to deliver the kind of information needed for prompt and targeted action. Hospital procedures for infection control were tightened, and a logistics system was developed to ensure the efficient delivery of protective equipment and other supplies.\n\nMass education campaigns persuaded the population to check frequently for fever and report promptly at fever clinics, which greatly reduced the time between onset of symptoms and isolation of patients. The establishment of a mechanism for coordinating the response of all relevant sectors was another key to Taiwan\u2019s success.\n\nThe global SARS outbreak developed quickly and dramatically, creating challenging and stressful demands on staff and health authorities at every outbreak site. The containment of SARS required heroic efforts and extraordinary measures that are difficult to sustain over time.\n\n\u201cInterruption of the last known chain of person-to-person transmission has come just in time. Health systems at every major outbreak site were strained to the limits of their capacity.\u201d said Dr Heymann.\n\nWHO continues to receive rumours of possible cases, which indicates that surveillance systems are working well. To date, all recently reported possible cases have been aggressively investigated and determined to have other causes. Failure to detect new cases over the next two weeks will greatly increase confidence that the SARS coronavirus has indeed been pushed out of its new human host, although a return of the disease cannot be ruled out completely on the basis of current knowledge.",

His 9-year-old son is hospitalized.\n\n19 February 2003 \u2013 An outbreak of \u201cbird flu\u201d in Hong Kong is reported to WHO following the detection of the A(H5N1) influenza virus in the 9-year-old boy. \u2013 WHO activates its global influenza laboratory network and calls for heightened global surveillance.\n\n20 February 2003 \u2013 The Department of Health in Hong Kong confirms that the boy\u2019s father was likewise infected with a strain of the influenza A(H5N1) virus.\n\n21 February 2003 \u2013 A 64-year-old medical doctor from Zhongshan University in Guangzhou (Guangdong Province) arrives in Hong Kong to attend a wedding. He checks into the ninth floor of the Metropole Hotel (room 911). Although he developed respiratory symptoms five days earlier, he feels well enough to sightsee and shop with his 53-year-old brother-in-law, who resides in Hong Kong.\n\n22 February \u2013 The Guangdong doctor seeks urgent care at the Kwong Wah Hospital in Hong Kong and is admitted to the intensive care unit with respiratory failure (he had previously treated patients with atypical pneumonia in Guangdong). He warns medical staff that he fears he has contracted a \u201cvery virulent disease\u201d. Health authorities in Hong Kong learn that his symptoms developed on 15 February, at which point he would have still been on the Chinese mainland.\n\n23 February \u2013 A 78-year-old female tourist from Toronto, Canada checks out of the Metropole Hotel and begins her homeward journey. On arrival in Toronto she is reunited with her family. \u2013 A team of WHO experts arrives in Beijing, but is granted permission to work at the central level only.\n\n24 February \u2013 The Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN) picks up a report stating that over 50 hospital staff are infected with a \u201cmysterious pneumonia\u201d in the city of Guangzhou.  \u2013 In Hong Kong, a 26-year-old local man develops a respiratory tract infection, but does not seek medical attention. From 15 to 23 February, he had visited an acquaintance staying on the ninth floor of the Metropole Hotel.\n\n25 February \u2013 Brother-in-law of Guangdong doctor is admitted to Kwong Wah Hospital and discharged.\n\n26 February \u2013 A 48-year-old Chinese-American businessman is admitted to the French Hospital in Hanoi with a 3-day history of fever and respiratory symptoms. His recent travel history includes a January trip to Shanghai, and a private trip from 8 to 10 February to Guangdong Province, and Macao. He travelled to Hong Kong on 17 February, departed for Hanoi on 23 February, and fell ill there. Shortly before his departure from Hong Kong, he had stayed on the ninth floor of the Metropole Hotel in a room across the hall from the Guangdong doctor.  \u2013 The businessman is attended by a WHO official, Dr Carlo Urbani, based in Viet Nam..\n\n28 February \u2013 Dr Urbani, alarmed by the unusual disease and concerned it might be a case of avian influenza, notifies the WHO office in Manila. WHO headquarters moves into a heightened state of alert.\n\n1 March  \u2013 Brother-in-law of the Guangdong doctor is re-admitted to Kwong Wah Hospital. \u2013 A 26-year-old woman is admitted to a hospital in Singapore with respiratory symptoms. A resident of Singapore, she was a guest on the ninth floor of the Hotel Metropole in Hong Kong from 21 to 25 February.\n\n4 March \u2013 The Guangdong doctor dies of atypical pneumonia at Kwong Wah Hospital.\n\n5 March \u2013 In Hanoi, the Chinese-American businessman, in a stable but critical condition, is air medivaced to the Princess Margaret Hospital in Hong Kong. Seven health care workers who had cared for him in Hanoi become ill. Dr Urbani continues to help hospital staff contain further spread.  \u2013 The 78-year-old Toronto woman, dies at Toronto\u2019s Scarborough Grace Hospital. Five members of her family are found to be infected and are admitted to the hospital.\n\n7 March \u2013 Health care workers at Hong Kong\u2019s Prince of Wales Hospital start to complain of respiratory tract infection, progressing to pneumonia. All have an identifiable link with Ward 8A.\n\n8 March  \u2013 In Taiwan, a 54-year-old businessman with a travel history to Guangdong Province is hospitalized with respiratory symptoms.\n\n10 March  \u2013 At least 22 staff at the Hanoi hospital are ill with influenza-like symptoms. Twenty show signs of pneumonia, one requires breathing support, and another is in critical condition. \u2013 The Ministry of Health in China asks WHO to provide technical and laboratory support to clarify the cause of the Guangdong outbreak of atypical pneumonia.\n\n11 March \u2013 Dr Urbani departs for Bangkok, on a Thai flight, where he is scheduled to give a presentation at a meeting on tropical diseases the following day. He is ill upon arrival and is immediately hospitalized.\n\n12 March \u2013 WHO issues a global alert about cases of severe atypical pneumonia following mounting reports of spread among staff at hospitals in Hong Kong and Hanoi. \u2013 At the French Hospital in Hanoi, 26 staff have symptoms. Of these, 25 have either pneumonia or acute respiratory syndrome, and 5 are in critical condition. The hospital is closed to new admissions. \u2013 Hong Kong health authorities formally report an outbreak of unidentified flu-like illness among hospital staff. As of midnight 11 March, 50 health care workers had been screened, 23 were found to have febrile illness, and 8 showed early chest X-ray signs of pneumonia. An additional 3 health care workers present with febrile illness and 2 show signs of pneumonia.\n\n13 March  \u2013 WHO sends emergency alert to its partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN). \u2013 The Chinese-American businessman dies in isolation at the Princess Margaret Hospital in Hong Kong. No cases among hospital staff are reported. \u2013 The Ministry of Health in Singapore reports three cases of atypical pneumonia in young women who had recently returned to Singapore after travelling to Hong Kong. All had stayed on the ninth floor of the Metropole Hotel in late February.  \u2013 The 44-year-old son of Toronto\u2019a first case dies in Scarborough Grace Hospital.\n\n14 March  \u2013 In Hong Kong, 39 staff at three hospitals undergo treatment for flu-like symptoms. Twenty-four exhibit signs of pneumonia and are described as in \u201cserious condition.\u201d  \u2013 Health authorities in Ontario, Canada take steps to alert doctors, hospitals, ambulance services, and public health units across the province that there are four cases of atypical pneumonia in Toronto that have resulted in 2 deaths. All occurred within a single family.  \u2013 The first members of a WHO GOARN multidisciplinary outbreak control team arrive in Hanoi.\n\n15 March \u2013 At 2:00 a.m., Singapore health authorities notify WHO staff, by urgent telecommunication, that a 32-year-old physician, who had treated the country\u2019s first two SARS cases, had boarded a flight from New York City to Singapore, after having attended a medial conference, to return to Singapore via Frankfurt. Shortly before boarding the flight, he reported symptoms to an alert medical colleague in Singapore, who notified health officials. WHO identifies the airline and flight, and the physician, his 30-year-old pregnant wife and 62-year-old mother-in-law are removed from the flight in Frankfurt and placed in isolation. They become Germany\u2019s first SARS cases. \u2013 WHO issues a rare travel advisory as evidence mounts that SARS is spreading by air travel along international routes. WHO names the mysterious illness after its symptoms: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and declares it \u201ca worldwide health threat.\u201d  \u2013 WHO issues its first case definitions of suspect and probable cases of SARS. WHO further calls on all travellers to be aware of the signs and symptoms, and issues advice to airlines. \u2013 Health Canada reports 8 cases of atypical pneumonia, including the 2 deaths. \u2013 Four intensive care specialists arrive in Hanoi to reinforce the GOARN team there. \u2013 The Singapore Ministry of Health reports 16 cases of atypical pneumonia.\n\n16 March \u2013 Over 150 suspect and probable cases of SARS are reported from around the world.\n\n17 March \u2013 China provides a first brief report to WHO about the Guangdong outbreak. The outbreak is said to have tapered off. \u2013 WHO sets up network of 11 leading laboratories in 9 countries to expedite detection of the causative agent and develop a robust and reliable diagnostic test. A similar network is set up to pool clinical knowledge on symptoms, diagnosis, and management. A third network is set up to study SARS epidemiology.\n\n18 March \u2013 Cases are now being reported in Canada, Germany, Taiwan (China), Thailand, and the United Kingdom as well as in Hong Kong, Viet Nam, and Singapore. The cumulative total of cases reported to WHO is 219 cases and 4 deaths.  \u2013 Hong Kong reports 123 cases, Hanoi 57, and Singapore 23. \u2013 Data indicate that the overwhelming majority of cases occur in health care workers, their family members, and others having close face-to-face contact with patients, supporting the view that SARS is spread by contact with droplets when patients cough or sneeze.\n\n19 March \u2013 Brother-in-law of Guangdong doctor dies in a Hong Kong hospital.\n\n20 March \u2013 The USA reports its first cases.  \u2013 The cumulative total of cases climbs to 306, with 10 deaths,\n\n21 March  \u2013 A WHO coordinating officer arrives in Singapore to assess possible need for international assistance. \u2013 WHO issues policy guidance on hospital discharge and follow-up.\n\n22 March \u2013 Hong Kong scientists devise first \u201chand-made\u201d diagnostic test and announce isolation of a candidate causative agent. The exact identity of the virus remains elusive.  \u2013 Thirteen countries on three continents report a cumulative total of 386 cases and 11 deaths.\n\n23 March \u2013 A WHO 5-person GOARN team arrives in Beijing and seeks permission to travel to Guangdong Province.\n\n24 March  \u2013 The Singapore Ministry of Health announces home quarantine measures whereby all contacts of SARS patients will be required to stay at home for 10 days. More than 300 persons are affected.\n\n25 March \u2013 Nine air passengers linked to a 15 March flight from Hong Kong to Beijing develop SARS after returning to Hong Kong. The flight is eventually linked to cases in 22 passengers and 2 flight attendants. \u2013 Scarborough Grace Hospital in Toronto is closed to new patients and visitors.\n\n26 March \u2013 First electronic \u201cground rounds\u201d consultation on SARS symptoms, diagnosis, and management is held, bringing together in real time 80 clinicians from 13 countries. \u2013 China reports a cumulative total of 792 cases and 31 deaths in Guangdong Province from 16 November 2002 to 28 February 2003. Officials had previously reported 305 cases and 5 deaths from mid-November to 9 February. \u2013 The WHO team in China reviews the case definition used for cases during the outbreak of atypical pneumonia and concludes that the cases most likely represent the same disease now referred to as SARS.  \u2013 With the new data from China, world cumulative total of cases soars to 1323, with 49 deaths. \u2013 Ontario health officials warn of possible health emergency.\n\n27 March \u2013 Scientists in the WHO lab network report major progress in the identification of the causative agent, with results from several labs consistently pointing to a new member of the coronavirus family.  \u2013 Hong Kong announces the closure of schools until 6 April and places 1080 people under quarantine. \u2013 Chinese authorities report SARS cases in other parts of China.  \u2013 WHO issues more stringent advice to international travellers and airlines, including recommendations on screening at certain airports. 28 March \u2013 China joins WHO collaborative networks.  \u2013 Some airlines in affected countries begin screening departing international travellers. \u2013 Financial analysts assess effects on stock markets and predict significant economic consequences if outbreak not controlled by June.\n\n29 March  \u2013 WHO infectious disease specialist, Dr Carlo Urbani, the first WHO officer to identify the outbreak of this new disease and treat the earliest cases in Hanoi, dies of SARS in Thailand.\n\n30 March \u2013 Canadian health officials close York Central Hospital to new patients and request hundreds of its employees to quarantine themselves. Thousands of Toronto residents face quarantine at home. \u2013 Hong Kong health authorities announce that 213 residents of the Amoy Gardens housing estate have been hospitalized with SARS since reporting on the disease began. Of this total, 107 reside in a single wing of the 35-storey Block E building. Most patients from Block E live in vertically-interrelated flats.\n\n31 March \u2013 Health authorities in Hong Kong issue an unprecedented isolation order to prevent the further spread of SARS.  \u2013 In Singapore, a 64-year-old vegetable hawker at a large wholesale market visits his brother in Singapore General Hospital.\n\n1 April \u2013 In Hong Kong, the number of cases linked to Amoy Gardens, which continues to grow, strongly suggests that the disease has spread beyond its initial focus in hospitals, with tertiary as well as secondary cases almost certainly occurring. \u2013 WHO epidemiologists determine that, since 19 March, 9 residents of Beijing, Taiwan (China) and Singapore have developed SARS following travel to Hong Kong.\n\n2 April \u2013 WHO recommends that persons travelling to Hong Kong and Guangdong Province consider postponing all but essential travel until further notice. This is the most stringent travel advisory issued by WHO in its 55-year history. \u2013 Chinese authorities announce updated figures of 361 new SARS cases and 9 deaths in Guangdong Province for the reporting period 1 to 31 March.  \u2013 Chinese government gives WHO team permission to travel \u201cimmediately\u201d to Guangdong. \u2013 The cumulative world total of SARS cases passes the 2000 mark.\n\n3 April \u2013 WHO team arrives in Guangdong and starts work immediately. Over the next days, the team visits Foshan city, where the first known case was reported in November, and Guangzhou city. All team requests for access to sites and interviews with health staff at all levels are readily granted. \u2013 Chinese Minister of Health appears on national television to address SARS-related issues.\n\n4 April \u2013 China begins daily electronic reporting of cases and deaths, nationwide by province. \u2013 Contact tracing by Singapore health authorities traces 94 SARS cases back to the country\u2019s index case, linked to the Metropole Hotel.\n\n6 April \u2013 A 53-year old Finnish staff member of the International Labour Organisation dies of SARS in Beijing. He had traveled to Beijing on a 23 March flight from Hong Kong. \n\n7 April  \u2013 WHO reports that around-the-clock international collaborative efforts to develop a diagnostic test are proving more problematic than hoped. Of the three diagnostic tests available, all have limitations as tools for stemming the SARS epidemic.  \u2013 Morgan Stanley chief economist Stephan Roach estimates the global economic impact of SARS at about US$ 30 billion.\n\n8 April  \u2013 In Singapore, the 64-year-old vegetable hawker is admitted to the emergency room of a hospital. He is not isolated until 12 hours later, when symptoms suggestive of SARS develop. \u2013 A cumulative total of 2671 cases and 103 deaths are reported from 17 countries.\n\n9 April  \u2013 The interim report of the WHO investigative team in China is presented to the Ministry of Health. The report notes that the health system in Guangdong Province had responded well to the outbreak, but expresses serious concern about the capacity of other provinces, which lack the strong health system seen in Guangdong, to cope with the challenge posed by SARS.  \u2013 The WHO team further expresses concern about the situation in Beijing, where only a minority of hospitals make daily reports of SARS cases. Contact traciing is not carried out systematically in Beijing, and health authorities fail to investigate rumours vigorously.\n\n10 April \u2013 A growing number of investigative media reports suggest that cases in Beijing military hospitals are not being frankly reported.\n\n11 April \u2013 South Africa reports its first probable SARS case. Cases have now been reported in 19 countries on four continents.\n\n14 April \u2013 The WHO team in Beijing fails to secure permission to visit military hospitals. \u2013 The cumulative number of worldwide cases passes the 3000 mark.\n\n15 April \u2013 The Beijing team is given permission to visit military hospitals. A first visit is made. No reporting of findings is authorized. \u2013 Hong Kong reports 9 SARS deaths, the largest number of deaths for a single day reported to date.\n\n16 April \u2013 Exactly one month after its establishment, the WHO laboratory network announces conclusive identification of the SARS causative agent: an entirely new coronavirus, unlike any other human or animal member of the Coronavirus family. \u2013 In Hong Kong, doctors report that SARS patients from the Amoy Gardens cluster are not responding to treatment as well as patients from other clusters. \u2013 The WHO team in Beijing estimates that the number of cases in the city is in the range of 100 to 200. The estimate contrasts sharply with the 37 cases officially reported two days previously. The team is granted permission to visit one military hospital.\n\n17 April  \u2013 Economic analysts in the Far East estimate initial SARS-related damage to regional GDP growth at US$ 10.6\u2013$15 billion. \u2013 China\u2019s losses, at US$2.2 billion, are the highest, but Hong Kong, where the outbreak has already cost US$1.7 billion, is the biggest SARS-related economic casualty. \u2013 In Hong Kong, retail sales have fallen by half since mid-March, tourism arrivals from mainland China have fallen 75% to 80%, and the entertainment and restaurant industries have recorded an 80% drop in business.\n\n18 April \u2013 The WHO team in Beijing expresses strong concern over inadequate reporting of SARS cases in military hospitals as rumours about undisclosed cases mount. \u2013 Hong Kong officials release the findings of an extensive investigation into a possible environmental cause of the Amoy Gardens cluster of cases. Attention is focused on possible transmission via the sewage system, though many other routes of exposure were also investigated. In an unusual feature, 66% of patients in the Amoy Gardens cluster present with diarrhoea. In most other clusters of cases, diarrhoea is typically seen in only 2% to 7% of cases.\n\n19 April \u2013 China\u2019s top leaders advise officials not to cover up cases of SARS. \u2013 Toronto authorities investigate a cluster of 31 suspect and probable SARS cases in members of a charismatic religious group, the health care workers who treated them, and close family and social contacts. Concern centers on opportunities for widespread community transmission during two large gatherings of the religious group on 28 and 29 March.  \u2013 The Vietnamese government considers closing its 1,130 km border with China.\n\n20 April \u2013 Beijing authorities announce 339 previously undisclosed cases of SARS, bringing the cumulative total of SARS cases in China to 1,959. Chinese authorities further announce that the traditional week-long May Day holiday will be shortened.  \u2013 The mayor of Beijing and the minister of health, both of whom had downplayed the SARS threat, are removed from their Communist Party posts.  \u2013 Singaporean health officials close a large wholesale fruit and vegetable market following detection of a cluster of 3 SARS cases linked to the market. Cases are traced back to the 64-year-old vegetable hawker.\n\n22 April \u2013 Chinese authorities report a cumulative total of 2001 SARS cases with 92 deaths.\n\n23 April \u2013 Beijing officials suspend all primary and secondary schools for a two-week period. \u2013 Chinese authorities report a cumulative total of 2305 probable cases of SARS and 106 deaths. The number of cases in Beijing is now 693.  \u2013 In Singapore, 8 probable and 14 suspect SARS cases are now linked to the vegetable hawker at the wholesale market.  \u2013 WHO advises travellers to Beijing and Shanxi Province, China, and Toronto, Canada to consider postponing all but essential travel.  \u2013 The cumulative number of probable SARS cases climbs to 4288, with 251 deaths.

        "Description of the Situation": "1 July 2003\n\nIf no unexpected events occur, the last two areas in the world \u2013 Toronto and Taiwan \u2013 to have experienced local transmission of SARS will be declared later this week to have broken the chain of person-to-person transmission. This achievement will mean that the SARS coronavirus is no longer thought to be circulating in the human population.\n\nFrom the outset, WHO\u2019s objective in combating SARS has been to seal off opportunities for the disease to become established in its new human host. Interruption of human transmission will be a milestone on the way to achieving this goal.\n\nHowever, scientists cannot at present guarantee that SARS has been vanquished, as questions remain about the origins of the virus and its possible seasonal occurrence. In addition, transmission may be occurring somewhere in the world at such a low level as to defy detection.\n\nIn line with the WHO objective, recommendations to postpone travel to designated areas were periodically issued. Evidence that SARS was being exported from areas with local transmission was of particular concern, as this contributed to further international spread and created a heavy burden in terms of isolation and infection control, contact tracing, and quarantine.\n\nThe list of areas with recent local transmission was initially developed to support the case definitions of suspect and probable cases, as both definitions depend on a history of close contact with a SARS patient. Application of the case definitions required knowledge of areas where the virus was spreading. Inclusion on the list also provided the basis for recommended exist screening of all departing passengers as a measure for preventing further international spread.\n\nThe chronology below provides a record of travel recommendations issued by WHO and of changes in the status of local transmission.\n\nBackground\n\n12 March: WHO issues first global alert to cases of atypical pneumonia rapidly spreading among hospital staff.\n\n15 March: WHO issues first emergency travel advisory, calling on all travellers to be aware of the main symptoms and signs of SARS. The disease appears to be spreading along the routes of international air travel.\n\n24 March: Hong Kong officials report 9 cases of atypical pneumonia among members of a tour group that travelled together on two flights, raising the possibility of in-flight transmission. Subsequent investigations revealed that one infected passenger, on a 15 March flight from Hong Kong to Beijing, may have infected 22 fellow passengers and 2 flight attendants.\n\n25 March: WHO reminds travellers to remain alert, but sees no need for travel restrictions to any destinations. Most new cases are being quickly identified and immediately isolated, thus reducing opportunities for transmission outside confined areas, such as the health care setting.\n\n27 March: WHO recommends exit screening of air passengers departing from areas where transmission is known to be occurring in local chains. No cases of suspected in-flight transmission are reported following this date.\n\n31 March: A large cluster of almost simultaneous cases, linked to the Amoy Gardens housing estate in Hong Kong, raises the possibility of an environmental source of infection and provides strong evidence that SARS has moved out of the hospital setting and into the community at large. In addition, several areas link their first imported cases to a history of travel in Guangdong or Hong Kong. These events set the stage for the first travel recommendations.\n\nTravel recommendations (postpone all but essential travel)\n\n2 April: Issued for Hong Kong and Guangdong Province, China.\n\n23 April: Issued for Beijing and Shanxi Province, China, and for Toronto, Canada.\n\n30 April: Lifted for Toronto.\n\n8 May: Issued for Tianjin and Inner Mongolia, China, and Taipei, Taiwan.\n\n17 May: Issued for Hebei Province, China.\n\n21 May: Issued for all of Taiwan.\n\n23 May: Lifted for Hong Kong and Guangdong Province,\n\n13 June: Lifted for Heibei, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, and Tianjin provinces, China.\n\n17 June: Lifted for Taiwan\n\n24 June Lifted for Beijing \u2013 the last area on the list.\n\nChanges in the list of areas with recent local transmission\n\n22 March: Initial list includes Toronto, parts of mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, and Viet Nam.\n\n11 April: Beijing added.\n\n28 April: Viet Nam removed \u2013 becomes first country to contain its SARS outbreak.\n\n1 May: Mongolia added.\n\n7 May: Philippines added.\n\n9 May: Mongolia removed.\n\n14 May: Toronto removed.\n\n20 May: Philippines removed.\n\n26 May: Toronto added for second time.\n\n31 May: Singapore removed.\n\n13 June: Guangdong, Hebei, Hubei, Inner Mongolia, Jilin, Jiangsu, Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Tianjin (China) removed.\n\n23 June: Hong Kong removed.\n\n24 June: Beijing removed.\n\n1 July: Only Toronto and Taiwan remain on the list.",

        "Description of the Situation": "30 June\n\nAs no new probable cases of SARS have been reported anywhere in the world since 15 June, WHO is moving from an emergency response to a research-based agenda aimed at protecting the world against any future resurgence of SARS.\n\nThe world must be considered vulnerable to a return of SARS pending better understanding of the origins of the virus and the circumstances that allowed it to jump from an animal host or environmental source to infect humans. Without such an understanding, predictions of the future evolution of the outbreak \u2013 including its end \u2013 cannot be made with certainty.\n\nThe SARS coronavirus was detected within a month by a \u201cvirtual\u201d network of laboratories, working around the clock. The complete sequencing of the virus\u2019 genome followed almost immediately.\n\nThese breakthroughs have supported progress in the development of diagnostic tests and greatly facilitated the investigation of unusual outbreaks, such as the Amoy Gardens housing cluster that affected more than 320 persons in late March. They also facilitated initial efforts to link an animal species with the first human cases, which were detected in southern China in mid-November of last year.\n\nFurther progress in the scientific understanding of SARS will depend on continued international collaboration. WHO is establishing an additional network to expedite much-needed animal studies.\n\nWHO also intends to monitor the effects of patents and patent applications on the speed with which SARS diagnostic tests, treatments, and vaccines are developed and made available for use, and on the manner in which prices are set for these technologies.\n\nAt the moment, it is too early to know all the effects that the patenting of SARS-related discoveries will have. However, the filing of patent applications does not in itself erect any barriers to continued scientific collaboration on SARS.\n\nThe \u201cdefensive\u201d use of patents can be a legitimate part of a researcher\u2019s efforts to make a discovery, and related discoveries in the future, widely available to other researchers, in the best collaborative tradition of biomedical science.\n\nIn the longer term, the manner in which SARS patent rights are pursued could have a profound effect on the willingness of researchers and public health officials to collaborate during future outbreaks of new infections diseases.\n\nWHO will therefore examine whether the terms of reference for such collaborations need to be modified to ensure that the credit for any intellectual property developed is appropriately attributed, that revenues derived from licensing such property are devoted to suitable uses, and that legitimate rewards for innovative efforts do not impose undue burdens on efforts to make tests, therapies, and preventive measures available to all.\n\nAs SARS has clearly demonstrated, the appearance of a new disease in a highly mobile, interconnected and interdependent world can have serious repercussions outside the health sector and far beyond the areas worst hit by the outbreak. This sense of shared vulnerability is considered a strong motivation for continued international collaboration.",

        "Description of the Situation": "27 June\n\nCase in Japan The Japanese Ministry of Health has today informed WHO that the probable SARS case, reported on Wednesday, has now been discarded. Further laboratory testing has confirmed a diagnosis of influenza B as the cause of the patient's symptoms.\n\nThe case involved a 33-year-old man from Taiwan, who arrived in Tokyo on 21 June and developed symptoms, including a high fever, two days later.\n\nCriteria for removal from the WHO list Questions have recently been raised about the criteria for removal of an area from the WHO list of areas with recent local transmission of SARS. An area is removed when twenty days - or twice the incubation period - have passed since the last reported probable case was placed in effective isolation, left the area, or died. If no new cases are detected during this period, the chain of transmission is considered broken.\n\nIsolation of a probable SARS case removes the person from the community and thus reduces opportunities for the virus to spread to others. It does not, however, entirely eliminate the risk of further transmission. A twenty-day period with no new infections is considered essential to demonstrate that further transmission has not occurred. Effective isolation means that patients with SARS are managed according to strict procedures of infection control at the health care facility, including strict adherence to the use of personal protective equipment by staff.\n\nRemoval from the list after 20 days applies only to the effective isolation of the last symptomatic case, not to contacts of a SARS case placed in home isolation as a precautionary measure. Experience to date indicates that transmission of SARS occurs when a person is ill. Asymptomatic contacts do not appear to pose an infectious risk to others.\n\nTo declare that a chain of transmission has been broken 20 days after the isolation of a person who has no symptoms and therefore poses no risk of spreading the disease would give a false sense of security. It reduces the period of medical follow-up and isolation considered essential to determine that no further transmission is likely to occur.\n\nFor this reason, WHO is maintaining its strict criteria - 20 days after a patient, following the onset of symptoms, was either placed in isolation, left the area, or died - for determining when a country can be safely removed from the list of areas with recent local transmission. As recent experiences have demonstrated, SARS is an especially resilient and unforgiving disease, ready to take advantage of any lapse in vigilance or control procedures.\n\nAt present, only Toronto and Taiwan remain on the list. In Toronto, the most recently detected probable case began showing symptoms on 12 June and was immediately placed in isolation. The last reported probable case in Taiwan was detected and isolated on 15 June. The list of areas with recent local transmission was initially developed to assist in application of the WHO definitions of suspect and probable cases of SARS. Both case definitions require a history of close contact with a suspect or probable case. A list of countries where local transmission is occurring helps physicians determine whether contact with a case was possible and thus assists in reaching a diagnosis.",

        "Description of the Situation": "26 June\n\nEarlier this week, WHO removed Hong Kong and Beijing \u2013 the world\u2019s two most severely affected cities \u2013 from its list of areas with recent local transmission of SARS. Only Toronto and Taiwan continue to experience chains of local transmission, and these outbreaks are likewise being brought close to containment.\n\nAfter almost four months, the global public health emergency caused by the sudden appearance and rapid spread of SARS is coming to an end.\n\nThe SARS virus, a new and unique member of the coronavirus family, first emerged in mid-November in southern China. One of the key questions now is whether SARS \u2013 pushed out of its new human host as chains of transmission are broken \u2013 will return.\n\nThe question arises because of the behaviour of other comparatively new and poorly understood viruses, including those that cause the Ebola and Marburg haemorrhagic fevers. These viruses periodically surface to cause outbreaks, usually limited to a defined geographical area, and then fade away to hide in some animal or environmental reservoir until conditions again become ripe for spread to humans.\n\nThe question of whether SARS will likewise resurface must remain open pending better understanding of the circumstances that allowed the new disease to emerge. The SARS virus is thought to have jumped to humans from some animal or environmental source.\n\nMany new viruses that jump from animals to humans, including the Nipah, Hendra, and hanta viruses, do not spread efficiently from one person to another and thus do not cause large and sustained outbreaks with a potential for rapid international spread. The SARS virus, however, spreads readily from person to person. Factors in the hospital environment have worked to amplify this efficient transmission considerably. In addition, though SARS has a high case fatality (around 15%), it allows enough of its victims to survive long enough to spread the disease to others \u2013 an effective survival strategy for a new virus.\n\nThe WHO scientific coordinator for SARS, Dr Klaus St\u00f6hr, is presently in China working together with scientists there to develop and prioritize a SARS research agenda. Research on the origins of the SARS virus is expected to top the agenda.\n\nIn the meantime, WHO has good reason to believe that, should SARS resurface later this year, the global impact will be milder than experienced during the initial global emergency. Five reasons support this view.\n\nFirst, the world\u2019s public health systems have demonstrated their capacity to move quickly into a phase of high alert. The prompt detection and isolation of imported cases in African and India are good examples of both the level of vigilance and its effectiveness in preventing further spread. Some of the former SARS hotspots, including Hong Kong and Singapore, plan to maintain a high level of vigilance, supported by measures for screening and detection, until at least the end of the year.\n\nSecond, the world knows what to do. Control measures, though centuries old, have demonstrated their capacity to completely halt outbreaks, as most recently seen in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Beijing.\n\nThird, the intensive research effort currently under way can be expected to improve scientific understanding of SARS and yield better control tools, most notably a rapid and reliable point-of-care diagnostic test.\n\nFourth, resolutions adopted during the May World Health Assembly have strengthened WHO\u2019s capacity to respond to outbreaks in important ways. In effect, these resolutions allow WHO to move from a passive reliance on official government notifications to a proactive role in warning the world as soon as evidence indicates that an outbreak poses a threat to international public health.\n\nFinally and perhaps most importantly, SARS has underscored the importance of immediately and fully disclosing cases of any disease with the potential for international spread. In the present climate of opinion, influenced by the lessons learned from SARS, it appears unlikely that any country would choose to conceal cases, should SARS resurface. In addition, SARS is simply too big a disease to hide for long.\n\nFor these reasons, WHO is optimistic that, should SARS return, it will not do so with a vengeance.",

        "Description of the Situation": "25 June\n\nWHO has today received reports of new probable cases of SARS in China and Japan.\n\nChina The Chinese Ministry of Health has today reported a new probable case of SARS involving a 77-year-old woman who fell ill in Guangdong Province. The case had previously been classified as a suspect case and, according to WHO recommendations, was placed in isolation on 3 June.\n\nThis is the first new case reported in Guangdong since 17 May. The last new case reported anywhere in mainland China was on 11 June.\n\nWHO is stressing that this is a reclassification of a suspect case as a probable case and, as such, should not be taken as an indication that local transmission has occurred. WHO is awaiting further details about the case and its relationship to documented chains of transmission that may point to the source of infection and the timing of exposure.\n\nThe most likely explanation is that the case, with its onset in early June, will be linked to a chain of transmission that was subsequently broken.\n\nMeticulous records kept by Hong Kong authorities have revealed that the woman was hospitalized in Hong Kong and treated for other illnesses from 20 to 21 May. As her room was on the same ward as a SARS patient, she was placed under health surveillance until 1 June. No SARS symptoms developed during this period, which represents the maximum incubation period.\n\nHowever, a possible link with the Hong Kong hospital cannot be entirely ruled out at this time. As became apparent during last week\u2019s global conference on SARS, the disease does not always follow a clinically predictable course in elderly patients, particularly when they have been treated for co-morbidity with other diseases.\n\nGuangdong, which saw the first cases of SARS in mid-November of last year, was removed from the list of areas with recent local transmission on 13 June. This retrospective reporting of a case newly classified as a \u201cprobable\u201d case does not constitute a reason for any change in the status of Guangdong.\n\nJapan The Japanese Ministry of Health has today reported a probable case of SARS involving a 33-year-old man who arrived in Tokyo, for sightseeing, on 21 June and developed symptoms two days later. He was immediately hospitalized and managed according to WHO recommendations.\n\nInitial diagnostic tests have ruled out other common causes of severe respiratory disease. Further testing is under way and epidemiological investigations have been initiated. As the patient is a resident of Taiwan, health officials there are contributing to the investigation.\n\nComment on new cases When an outbreak wanes while vigilance is still high, a few additional cases are almost always detected. Their prompt reporting provides further assurance that surveillance systems are alert. However, WHO anticipates that many reported cases during this phase of the outbreak will turn out, on further investigation, to be \u201cbackground noise\u201d \u2013 that is, cases of community-acquired pneumonia caused by agents other than the SARS virus.\n\nIn areas that have experienced large outbreaks and therefore accumulated considerable skill in the clinical and laboratory diagnosis of cases, reports of newly detected probable cases are less likely to be discarded upon further investigation.",

        "Description of the Situation": "24 June\n\nEffective today, the World Health Organization (WHO) is removing its recommendation that people should postpone all but essential travel to Beijing, China. Beijing was the last area in the world to which this advice still applied.\n\nThe recommendation to consider postponing all but essential travel to Beijing was issued on 23 April in order to minimize the international spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). WHO is changing this recommendation as the situation in the Chinese capital has now improved significantly. The last new case in Beijing was isolated on May 29, since when a number of suspect cases have been considered but ruled out as SARS. No cases have recently been exported from Beijing and all recent cases have been traced to known chains of transmission.\n\n\u201cWe are changing the travel advice for Beijing effective Tuesday, June 24,\u201d said Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland, Director-General of the WHO. \u201cBeijing is the last area to which WHO recommended that people should postpone all but essential travel. This is very good news and shows the great progress the world has made against SARS.\"\n\nBeijing, with a cumulative total of 2521 probable cases and 191 deaths, has had the largest outbreak of SARS anywhere in the world, followed by Hong Kong, with 1755 cumulative cases and 296 deaths, and Guangdong Province, China, with 1511 cumulative cases and 57 deaths.\n\nFor reasons that are not yet fully understood, areas of mainland China have experienced a lower case fatality ratio than seen in most other outbreaks.\n\nChina began daily reporting of SARS cases in early April, when Beijing reported 29 cases and 4 deaths. At the peak of the outbreak, towards the end of April, Beijing was reporting more than 100 new cases each day. Containment of an outbreak of such dimensions is a tribute to the effectiveness of centuries-old control measures, including isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine, supported by government commitment at the highest levels.\n\nRecommendations to postpone travel have been issued following consideration of several factors, including the magnitude of probable SARS cases, the pattern of recent local transmission, and the last dates of export of cases.\n\nOn 27 March, WHO recommended that all areas with recent local transmission should screen all international departing passengers to ensure that those who are showing symptoms of SARS or have had recent contact with a SARS patient do not travel. Since then, a number of recommendations have been made that people should postpone all but essential travel to areas with large outbreaks of SARS which posed a potential threat to travellers.\n\nMore than 20 days have now passed since the last new case was isolated in Beijing. Therefore, Beijing has also been removed from the list of areas with recent local transmission.",

        "Description of the Situation": "23 June\n\nWHO has today removed Hong Kong from its list of areas with recent local transmission of SARS. Twenty days, which is twice the maximum incubation period, have passed since the last case was isolated on 2 June.\n\nWhen 20 days have passed since removal of the last case from the community at large, the chain of human-to-human transmission is considered broken, thus eliminating the risk of infection for both local residents and travellers.\n\n\u201cThis is a very significant achievement,\u201d said Dr David Heymann, Executive Director of Communicable Diseases at WHO. \u201cHong Kong, with its dense population and fluid border with China, had one of the hardest outbreaks to control. This success means that the whole world can now feel safer from the SARS threat.\u201d\n\nSARS was first carried out of southern China into Hong Kong, and then on to Hanoi, Toronto, and Singapore in late February. Some 16 visitors and guests to the ninth floor of a Hong Kong hotel became infected through contact, in ways that remain mysterious, with a symptomatic medical doctor from Guangdong Province, who stayed in the hotel\u2019s room 911. The index case for Hong Kong\u2019s first outbreak, in the Prince of Wales Hospital, visited an acquaintance staying on the same floor during the critical days in February. Additional clusters were also subsequently linked to the hotel.\n\nSARS had not yet been identified as a dangerous new disease when the outbreak hit Hong Kong\u2019s hospitals. Doctors and nurses, unaware of the need to isolate patients and protect themselves, became the first victims as they struggled to save lives. In a particularly unfortunate incident, the index patient at Prince of Wales, admitted on 4 March, was treated four times daily with a jet nebulizer, which probably aerosolized the virus and greatly increased opportunities for spread.\n\nIn late March, Hong Kong suffered a major setback when a large cluster, eventually numbering more than 300, of almost simultaneous new cases was traced to a single building in the Amoy Gardens housing state. That event, which raised the possibility of an environmental source of infection or even airborne spread of the virus, was investigated by teams of local specialists. The outbreak was attributed to an \u201cunlucky\u201d convergence of environmental conditions that allowed the contamination of vertically-linked apartments. This conclusion, subsequently confirmed by additional studies, calmed fears that the SARS virus might be airborne.\n\nFrom the day when the first cluster of cases was recognized, Hong Kong officials have provided open, honest, and abundant information about SARS to both the public and the media. Hong Kong also benefited from the contribution of its outstanding scientists, epidemiologists, and clinicians, who were at the forefront of efforts to track down source cases in the various clusters, identify the causative agent, develop diagnostic tests, and work out treatment protocols.\n\nFaced with the largest outbreak outside mainland China, Hong Kong also pioneered many of the control measures used to successfully contain smaller outbreaks elsewhere. It is gratifying that these measures have now brought Hong Kong to the point of victory over the virus, although continued vigilance remains vital.\n\nOn 2 April, WHO advised the public to consider postponing all but essential travel to Hong Kong. That recommendation was removed more than 7 weeks later, on 23 May.",

        "Description of the Situation": "20 June\nWHO case definition for diagnostic purposes\n\nAn article published in this week's British Medical Journal has questioned whether the WHO case definitions for suspected and probable SARS are adequate to pick up infected cases at the earliest stage when patients are said to be most infectious.\n\n\nBritish Medical Journal table of contents \n\n\nThe WHO case definition takes a \"wide net\" approach, and is intended to assist in the identification and prompt isolation of any person who might have been exposed to the SARS virus. WHO continues to recommend that suspect cases be immediately isolated and remain so until either a probable diagnosis is made or another agent is determined to be the cause.\n\nWhile this definition has worked well to contain the outbreak in this initial emergency response, WHO is fully aware that a more precise definition is needed for longer-term surveillance.\n\nPending the development of a reliable point-of-care diagnostic test, case definitions, based on an evaluation of symptoms and history of possible contact with a SARS patient, remain the only way to find possibly infected persons and reduce opportunities for further spread. WHO therefore welcomes the BMJ study, which suggests that additional symptoms might contribute to a more sensitive definition. However, this is a single study based on patients presenting at a single hospital. Moreover, by inclusion of symptoms such as diarrhoea, this definition risks picking up even more false-positive cases.\n\nDuring the Kuala Lumpur global conference on SARS, WHO established a working group specifically charged to develop better case definitions. The group will draw on data from all the main outbreak sites.\n\n\"WHO regards an improved diagnostic test as a top priority,\" said David Heymann, the WHO Executive Director for Communicable Diseases. \"The next influenza season will result in a large number of patients with symptoms easily confused with SARS. In addition to a good diagnostic test, a more precise and sensitive case definition is absolutely essential to keep health services from being overwhelmed. We will be producing this as an international collaborative effort, based on the best available evidence.\"\n\nDr Heymann estimates that SARS surveillance will need to continue for at least a year. WHO recommendations for surveillance and reporting are also being revised for this second phase, which moves from an emergency response to sustainable vigilance.\nHong Kong close to being removed from list\n\nOn Sunday 22 June, 20 days will have passed since the last probable case of SARS in Hong Kong was placed in isolation on 2 June. If no new cases are detected over the weekend, Hong Kong will be removed from the list of areas with recent local transmission on Monday.\n\nBoth WHO and health authorities in Hong Kong are taking a cautious approach to what would be a very significant achievement in the history of SARS control. WHO was given details today about a suspect SARS case who has been in isolation since 9 June. The results of 3 PCR tests have been negative. Serology tests, conducted 20 days after the onset of symptoms, have also been negative.\n\nToday's report on this case confers another layer of assurance that surveillance remains intense and that new cases continue to be quickly detected and isolated. As Hong Kong scientists and laboratories rank among the best in the world, WHO has full confidence that the case in question is not SARS.\n\nRemoval from the list means that the chain of person-to-person transmission has been broken, thus eliminating the risk of infection for both local residents and travellers.\n\nOn 2 April, WHO advised the public to consider postponing all but essential travel to Hong Kong. That recommendation was removed more than 7 weeks later, on 23 May.\n\nTravel recommendations are presently in place only for Beijing, China.",

        "Description of the Situation": "19 June\n\nThe first global conference on SARS, held on Tuesday and Wednesday in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, was convened by WHO to provide technical guidance for the ongoing and long-term response to SARS.\n\nAs the number of new cases continues to dwindle, one of the most important questions for the future is whether SARS can be eliminated or eradicated from its new human host. Experience with many other infectious diseases, including smallpox and poliomyelitis, has demonstrated that complete eradication of an infectious disease is possible only when three precise requirements can be met.\n\nFirst, an effective intervention capable of interrupting transmission \u2013 ideally, a vaccine \u2013 must be available. Second, easy-to-use diagnostic tools are needed, with sufficient sensitivity and specificity to detect levels of infection that can lead to transmission of the disease. Finally, infection of humans must be essential to the life-cycle of the causative agent \u2013 if the chain of human-to-human transmission is broken, the agent cannot survive. Existence of an animal reservoir greatly complicates eradication, but does not preclude it, provided interventions exist to break the chain of transmission in the animal species as well.\n\nTo achieve eradication at the global level, the control intervention must be safe, simple, and affordable. Current control measures for SARS, including case detection and isolation, tracing and follow-up of contacts, and quarantine, are effective but extremely time-intensive, costly, and socially disruptive. Few if any countries can sustain such efforts over time.\n\nAs noted during yesterday\u2019s conference sessions, an adequate point-of-care diagnostic test is still not available for SARS and remains a top priority. Such a test would likewise need to be sufficiently simple and affordable to be used in countries having a range of different health systems and resources for health care.\n\nResearchers at the conference also confirmed that far too little is understood about the origins of the SARS virus and the possible role \u2013 if any \u2013 that animals play in the transmission cycle. Some studies have suggested that the earliest cases of SARS, in Guangdong Province, China, may have had contact, during slaughter or due to proximity to so-called \u201cwet\u201d markets, with certain wild animal species consumed as delicacies in southern China. In addition, a SARS-like virus has been detected in a few of these wild animal species. Additional studies are urgently needed before any firm conclusions can be reached. Answers to these questions will also greatly assist predictions of the future evolution of SARS.\n\nFor the time being, WHO continues to stress the need to break the chain of human-to-human transmission through use of currently available control tools. In many of the most severely affected areas, these measures have already demonstrated their ability to eliminate SARS in a defined geographical area.\n\nHowever, the long-term response to SARS, which includes the prevention of importation or re-importation of cases into SARS-free areas, will clearly require different strategies for surveillance and response, as current measures cannot be sustained over time.\n\nMoreover, scientists cannot, on the basis of the very limited data available, rule out the possibility that SARS will resurface when environmental conditions or seasons again favour transmission among humans. Should this occur, countries will need to be ready with alert surveillance systems and good preparedness strategies.",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "June 18\n\nTomorrow will mark the 100th day since WHO first alerted the world, on 12 March, to the SARS threat. From the 55 cases recognized on that day, alarmingly concentrated in hospitals in Hong Kong, Hanoi, and Singapore, the outbreak exploded within a month to cause some 3000 cases and more than 100 deaths in 20 countries on all continents.\n\nBy that time, too, the public face of SARS had come to be symbolized by a mask \u2013 an appropriate image for a disease still shrouded in mystery. Although the causative agent was conclusively identified on 17 April, the disease had no vaccine, no effective treatment, an overall case fatality of 15%, and many unexplained features. As the coming weeks would reveal, SARS was also full of surprises.\n\nSARS was carried out of southern China, where the first cases are now known to have occurred in late November 2002, by an infected medical doctor who spent a single night on the 9th floor of a Hong Kong hotel in late February. He infected at least 16 other persons staying on or visiting the same floor. From this single event, which is still not fully understood in terms of the dynamics of transmission, SARS spread internationally.\n\nThe number of cases passed 4000 on 23 April and then rapidly soared to 5000 on 28 April, 6000 on 2 May, and 7000 on 8 May, when cases were reported from 30 countries. During the peak of the global outbreak, near the start of May, more than 200 new cases were being reported each day. Detection of new infections subsequently slowed, passing 8000 on 22 May.\n\nDuring June, the number of new cases has gradually dwindled to the present daily handful. WHO is confident that all countries that have experienced outbreaks are disclosing cases fully and promptly \u2013 SARS is too big a disease to hide for long. The global outbreak, at least in this initial phase, is clearly coming under control.\n\nThe reduced number of cases is not a \u201cnatural phenomenon\u201d that can be attributed to a change in the virulence or infectivity of the SARS virus, as often happens with new diseases that quickly \u201cburn out\u201d. Instead, the dramatic reduction in the number of SARS cases is the result of monumental efforts on the part of governments and health care staff, supported by a well-informed and cooperative public.\n\nThe achievement is all the more impressive when viewed against the nature of SARS as an especially difficult and dangerous new disease.\n\nSARS is the first severe and readily transmissible new disease to strike a globalized society. As such, its history to date illustrates the favourable conditions, both for the devastating spread of a new disease and solidarity in its containment, that have come to characterize a closely interconnected, interdependent, and highly mobile world. On the negative side, the volume of international air travel allowed SARS to spread around the world with unprecedented speed. Also on the negative side, the close interdependence of economies and markets amplified the economic impact of SARS considerably, while instantaneous electronic communications elevated public concern \u2013 often to the point of panic \u2013 and further added to the social and economic disruption caused by SARS.\n\nJust as Ebola came to symbolize the fear inspired by a new disease, SARS has vividly depicted a truism of the infectious disease situation in a globalized world: an outbreak anywhere places every country at risk. The containment of SARS \u2013 or any other epidemic-prone disease \u2013 requires unprecedented solidarity and makes such an effort a matter of self-interest for every nation.\n\nThe success to date clearly demonstrates that a spirit of international solidarity has been a driving force in the rapid containment of SARS.\n\nOn the positive side, the power of electronic communications allowed the establishment of \u201cvirtual\u201d networks of researchers, epidemiologists, and clinicians, who set aside competition and collaborated around the clock to identify the SARS causative agent, sequence its genome, define clinical features, and investigate modes of transmission in record time.\n\nThe world\u2019s electronic interconnectedness also contributed to the effectiveness of the first global alerts to SARS. The initial 12 March alert, followed three days later by a stronger and more specific warning, provided a clear line of demarcation in the early history of SARS. Areas with cases prior to the alert experienced the most devastating outbreaks. These occurred in Hong Kong, Hanoi, Singapore, Toronto, and China. Prior to 12 March, in all these cases, hospital staff, unaware that a new disease had surfaced and was spreading in health care settings, took no precautions to protect themselves as they fought to save the lives of patients. SARS spread rapidly in these hospitals, and then spilled over into the wider community, resulting in the exportation of cases elsewhere.\n\nWith the notable exception of Taiwan, all other areas experiencing imported cases after the alerts were able to prevent further transmission altogether or hold the number of additional cases to a very small number. Most observers attribute this success to the high level of awareness and preparedness that followed the alerts, greatly aided by responsible reporting in the media.\n\nKey weapon: the thermometer One of the most important lessons learned to date is the decisive power of high-level political commitment to contain an outbreak even when sophisticated control tools are lacking. SARS has been brought close to defeat by the diligent and unrelenting application \u2013 on a monumental scale \u2013 of centuries-old control measures: isolation, contact tracing and follow-up, quarantine, and travel restrictions. Other successful measures include the designation of SARS-dedicated hospitals to minimize the risk of spread to other hospitals, mass media campaigns to educate the public and encourage prompt reporting of symptoms, and the establishment of fever clinics to relieve pressure on emergency rooms, which have also been the setting for many new infections. Screening at airports and other border points and, through fever checks, throughout selected population groups has also been effective.\n\nAll of these measures contributed to the prompt detection and isolation of new sources of infection \u2013 a key step on the way to breaking the chain of transmission. Given the importance of supportive public attitudes and actions, the single most important control \u201ctool\u201d in bringing SARS under control may very well be the thermometer.\n\nViet Nam broke the chain of transmission on 28 April, as did the Philippines on 20 May, and Singapore on 31 May. Recommendations to postpone all but essential travel have been removed for all areas except Beijing, China.\n\nIn reaching these landmarks in the containment of SARS, the most severely affected countries and areas have identified and rapidly corrected long-standing weaknesses in their health systems in ways that will mean permanent improvements for the management of all diseases. In addition, systems of data collection and reporting, and new patterns of openly and frankly communicating information to the public will hold the world in good stead when the next new disease emerges and the next influenza pandemic breaks out.\n\nContinued surveillance and vigilance needed for a year SARS has repeatedly demonstrated its resilience, most recently with the resurgence of cases in Toronto. As underscored by researchers at this week\u2019s meeting in Kuala Lumpur, SARS has features that can thwart even the best preparedness plans and slip past even the highest levels of awareness and suspicion. Under the right conditions, which remain poorly understood, single highly infectious persons have been known to set off trains of transmission that have led, in the worst cases, to almost 100 additional infections. In Singapore, five patients accounted for 103 of the total 206 cases in the outbreak.\n\nAnother significant problem occurs when SARS symptoms are masked by other diseases. Many surprising clusters of cases have been fanned by such patients, as they do not arouse suspicion, are not isolated or managed according to strict procedures of infection control, have no restrictions on visitors, and are frequently transferred to other hospitals for further treatment or tests.\n\nAlthough SARS is clearly coming under control, the need for continued vigilance is now greater than ever. The world still has a chance to interrupt the chain of person-to-person transmission everywhere. However, because of the many unanswered scientific questions, particularly concerning the origins of the virus and the contribution of environmental contamination to overall transmission, WHO sees a need for at least a full year of surveillance to determine whether the disease has established endemicity and to ensure that no cases have spread, undetected, to countries with poor surveillance and reporting systems. If the disease has not become endemic, the next big hurdles will concern the questions of a possible animal reservoir and possible seasonal recurrence. Scientists cannot rule out the possibility that the SARS virus hides somewhere in nature, as the Ebola virus does, only to return when conditions are once again ripe for the efficient spread of infection to its new human host.\n\nFinally, as underscored in today\u2019s conference sessions, the development of a reliable point-of-care diagnostic test must be given high priority. Pending the availability of such a test, and for a while yet to come, every case of atypical pneumonia has the potential to arouse suspicion and spark a panic. Any hospital-based cluster of febrile patients with respiratory symptoms will need extensive investigation. And any person with a fever or cough could be barred from international travel.\n\nAs long as a single case of SARS exists or is suspected anywhere in the world, and as long as fundamental questions about the origins of the virus remain unanswered, all countries need to remain on guard.",

        "Description of the Situation": "13 June 2003\n\nChange in travel recommendationsEffective today, the World Health Organization (WHO) is removing its recommendation that people should postpone all but essential travel to Hebei, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi and Tianjin regions in China.\n\nRecommendations to consider postponing all but essential travel to these regions of China were issued on 23 April and 8 May in order to minimize the international spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). WHO is changing this recommendation as the situation in these areas has now improved significantly. Information about the decline of the outbreaks in Hebei, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi and Tianjin has been carefully reviewed by WHO and suggests that SARS is no longer a potential threat to international travellers to these regions.\n\nRecommendations to postpone travel are issued following consideration of several factors, including the magnitude of current SARS cases, the pattern of recent local transmission, and the last dates of export of cases.\n\nIn addition, WHO is removing Guangdong, Hebei, Hubei, Inner Mongolia, Jilin, Jiangsu, Shaanxi, Shanxi and Tianjin from the list of areas with recent local transmission. This follows confirmation that there have been no new cases isolated in any of these areas for more than twice the maximum incubation period, in other words more than 20 days.\n\nOn 27 March, WHO recommended that areas with recent local transmission should screen all international departing passengers to ensure that those who are sick with SARS or are contacts of SARS cases do not travel. This recommendation is still valid for Beijing, Hong Kong and Taiwan in China, and Toronto, Canada. For a summary of travel recommendations, see the table below.\n\nDuring a recent trip to Beijing, Dr David Heymann, WHO\u2019s Executive Director for Communicable Diseases, commented on the measures now in place in China to contain the spread of SARS. \"We\u2019ve seen that there has been a massive effort to mobilize the population both in urban and rural areas across the country, encouraging people to monitor themselves for fever and to ensure that SARS cases are quickly identified, isolated and treated.\"\n\n\"China has made huge strides in its effort to contain the outbreak of SARS,\" said Dr Heymann. \"The key thing now is to maintain vigilance and build up China's disease surveillance system. Public health authorities in China and around the world must continue to watch out for new cases of SARS to ensure that it does not emerge again elsewhere.\"\n\nSituation in Toronto The category of pattern of SARS transmission for the city of Toronto has been changed from \u201cB\u201d to \u201cC\u201d. This is because a probable case with laboratory confirmation of SARS coronavirus exported from Toronto had not been previously identified as a contact and put into voluntary home isolation. \u201cPattern B\u201d transmission is defined as an area having more than one generation of local probable SARS cases, but only among persons who have been previously identified and followed-up as known contacts of probable SARS cases. \u201cPattern C\u201d transmission is defined as an area having local probable cases occurring among persons who have not been previously identified as known contacts of probable SARS cases.\n\n\nSARS Travel Recommendations Summary Table, 13 June",

The most affected provinces are Sud Kivu ( 1387 cases including 26 deaths, case fatality rate, 1.87%), Katanga (7557 cases with 221 deaths, case fatality rate, 2.92 %), ) and Kasai Oriental (3098 cases and 89 deaths, case fatality rate, 2.87%), with most of the cases occurring in the Tsilingue area. The epidemic seems to be spreading in Kasai Oriental as three new health areas were affected during the week of 1-8 June. There is also a high risk of spread to the neighbouring province, Kasai Occidental.\n\nThe Governor of Kasai Oriental province has organized a cholera task force meeting with partners including WHO to look at how to increase capacity in the cholera treatment centres and how to provide supplies for patients with severe dehydration.",

        "Description of the Situation": "12 June 2003 \n\nChina\u2019s Executive Vice Minister of Health, Mr Gao Qiang, and Dr David Heymann, WHO\u2019s Executive Director for Communicable Diseases, briefed the press this morning on the situation of SARS control in China. Also in attendance were Dr Qi Ziaoqiu, Director-General of the Department of Disease Control in the Chinese Ministry of Health, and Dr Henk Bekedam, WHO Representative to China.\n\nThe briefing marked the first joint news conference between high-ranking Chinese and WHO officials since the SARS outbreak began.\n\nThe briefing followed a day of intensive meetings during which WHO officials reviewed data and statistics from selected provinces, voiced their concerns, and received frank and detailed answers.\n\nDr Heymann praised the openness with which the WHO team was welcomed by the Ministry of Health, and described the measures now in place to control and prevent SARS as \u201cexcellent\u201d. He cited the high level of commitment and determination at all levels of the health system as largely responsible for the dramatic recent decline in the number of cases seen throughout mainland China.\n\nOne purpose of the visit was to determine how China had succeeded in bringing down the number of cases so rapidly, and to encourage officials to share their experiences with the rest of the world.\n\nIndications of the effectiveness of control measures, cited by Dr Heymann, include the very short time now occurring between the onset of symptoms and the detection and isolation of cases, and the speed and efficiency of contact tracing. Such measures are important as they limit the amount of time that an infected person is capable of spreading the virus to others and thus bring control efforts closer to the stage when the chain of person-to-person transmission can be broken.\n\nOther effective measures include systems for both passive and active surveillance, such as fever checks at train and bus stations and airports, a nationwide mass media campaign to inform and educate the public, and a very large number of fever clinics to assess those who suspect they may have symptoms.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen that there has been a massive effort to mobilize the population both in urban and rural areas across the country, encouraging people to monitor themselves for fever and to ensure that SARS cases are quickly identified, isolated and treated.\u201d\n\nSpecific concerns expressed by the WHO team include the lack of a sustainable surveillance system that can be relied on to detect the first hints of a resurgence of cases, some delays in meeting WHO requests for further information, and wide variations in application of the national case definitions, which can lead to under-reporting of cases. Some problems related to prompt sharing and analysis of data are considered to arise from institutional and administrative problems, particularly concerning the information flow from provinces to the central level.\n\nAnother major concern is the large number of cases that have no known source of exposure, thus making it extremely difficult to trace patterns of transmission. In Beijing, the number of cases with no known contact with a SARS patient has recently increased from 50% to more than 70%.\n\nIn the interest of protecting against a further resurgence of cases, WHO officials singled out strengthening of surveillance capacity as the top priority. Experience to date has shown that a single case, especially if highly infectious, can rapidly ignite an explosive outbreak.\n\n\u201cWith SARS seemingly on the decline for now, there is a great need to strengthen the SARS control and surveillance system in China,\u201d said Dr Bekedam. \u201cThe system now in place grew out of an emergency response and has to be strengthened for the long run.\u201d He expressed doubt that the present system would be strong enough \u201cto hold back the tide\u201d when confronted with a resurgence of the disease.\n\nIn his assessment of the long-term SARS situation in China, Dr Heymann also stressed the need for systematic studies of the origins of SARS. \u201cWe still don\u2019t know exactly where SARS came from, or how it was transferred to the human population. We don\u2019t know if this disease is seasonal and will decrease this year but come back next year.\u201d\n\nUntil proper research into the origins of SARS has been conducted, it will be impossible to predict when the conditions that first allowed the virus to jump to humans from a suspected animal reservoir might be repeated in the near or distant future.\n\nWHO initial assessments of the SARS situation in China, issued in late April following a visit to Guangdong Province, expressed serious concern over the lack of urgency in reporting cases of SARS in China, and criticized the government for not immediately treating the outbreak as a public health emergency requiring extraordinary measures for its control.\n\nDr Heymann and other members of the WHO team are now satisfied that these measures are in place, at least for the immediate response to SARS. Recent visits to selected provinces, jointly conducted by the Chinese Ministry of Health and WHO, found a high level of public awareness of SARS, its symptoms and mode of transmission, and the need for twice-daily fever checks.\n\nChina is regarded as the epicentre of the SARS outbreak. The country was home to the first cases, detected in mid-November of last year, and presently accounts for almost two thirds of all reported cases worldwide. The WHO visit was arranged to secure reassurance that control measures in this vast country are adequate to continue the downward trends in cases and, equally important, to ensure that a sustainable system is in place to detect and contain a resurgence of cases. WHO is also anxious to ensure that the considerable knowledge and experience acquired in managing the largest SARS outbreak on record is shared for the benefit of all countries.\n\nThe SARS outbreak has revealed substantial weaknesses in the disease surveillance system in China. When investment in health infrastructure is neglected, conditions are ripe for the unchecked spread of any epidemic-prone disease, often at tremendous cost to a nation\u2019s economy. In the view of WHO, the surveillance system in China needs to be made more flexible and capable of a much more rapid and consistent response to any new infectious disease threat.\n\nDuring the visit, Chinese officials expressed deep concern about the country\u2019s capacity to deal with the next influenza season against a background of possible SARS cases. The presence of influenza could greatly complicate the detection and accurate diagnosis of SARS cases, while also increasing the caseload of suspect cases considerably.\n\nThe containment of SARS remains the overriding objective of WHO. If SARS is not contained, the world will face a situation in which every case of atypical pneumonia, and every hospital-based cluster of febrile patients with respiratory systems will have the potential to rouse suspicions of SARS and spark widespread panic.\n\nIn an earlier report, a WHO assessment team reached the following conclusion: \u201cIf SARS is not brought under control in China, there will be no chance of controlling the global threat of SARS. Achieving control of SARS is a major challenge especially in a country as large and diverse as China. Effective disease control and reporting are the cornerstone of any strategy to do this.\u201d",

        "Description of the Situation": "10 June 2003\n\nDr David Heymann, Executive Director for Communicable Diseases at WHO, is travelling today to China, where he will confer with health officials about the SARS outbreak and discuss plans for the future. Other members of the team include Dr Gu\u00e9na\u00ebl Rodier, Director of Communicable Disease Surveillance and Response, and Dr Thomas Grein, who coordinates global response operations for SARS.\n\nThe purpose of the visit is to take stock of the current SARS situation in China and exchange views on the next steps forward. In particular, WHO would like to develop, in collaboration with the Chinese government, a research agenda that fully exploits the many intriguing lines of evidence uniquely associated with the SARS experience in China. WHO officials also want to assess areas where Chinese authorities may require more support to ensure that the disease is securely contained and to protect against a future recrudescence of cases.\n\n\u201cSARS is a serious disease with many puzzling features,\u201d said Dr Heymann. \u201cLong-term containment depends on finding answers to a long list of scientific questions. China has much to offer the rest of the world.\u201d\n\nSome immediate issues for discussion concern case definitions, procedures for contact tracing, and the extent of local transmission in specific areas. The WHO team further seeks reassurance that hospital equipment and supplies for infection control are adequate, especially in the poorer provinces.\n\nMeasures may need to be found for sustaining China\u2019s present monumental effort to contain SARS, particularly as programmes for responding to other priority diseases, such as HIV/AIDS and TB, may suffer in the long run.\n\nWeaknesses in the health infrastructure, notably inadequate surveillance, reporting, and hospital facilities in some of China\u2019s poorer provinces, have been of concern since the first report of a WHO assessment team was issued in early April. Both WHO and the Chinese Ministry of Health regard the emergency response to SARS as an excellent opportunity to strengthen, throughout the mainland, systems for detecting and responding to all emerging and epidemic-prone infectious diseases. Such long-term and comprehensive improvements will also strengthen China\u2019s capacity to respond to the next influenza pandemic, which many experts now regard as imminent.\n\nWHO officials are also hoping to learn which measures taken by China have so rapidly brought the country\u2019s SARS outbreak \u2013 the largest in the world \u2013 under control.\n\nThe first cases of SARS were detected in Guangdong Province, China, in mid-November of last year. That outbreak has since been brought under control. Initial studies suggest a lower case fatality ratio than seen elsewhere, and high cure rates. In addition, a report on the epidemiology of the outbreak, issued in mid-May by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, provides evidence suggesting that close contact with wild game animals is linked to the first sporadic cases, supporting a hypothesis that the SARS virus may have jumped to humans from an animal reservoir. In addition, the outbreak in Guangdong Province shows some features, in terms of incubation period and groups at highest risk, that differ from the clinical picture seen in outbreaks elsewhere.\n\nAnswers to these and other questions will help build a solid scientific basis for understanding SARS, predicting its future evolution, and knowing how to respond should cases surface in new areas or resurface in areas where the disease has been contained.\n\nUnlike many new diseases that have emerged in the past two decades, SARS shows no sign of burning out on its own. If the disease is pushed back out of its new human host, this will result from the persistent application of simple yet highly effective control tools \u2013 prompt detection and isolation of cases, strict infection control in hospitals, and tracing and appropriate follow-up of all contacts.\n\nBoth Viet Nam and Singapore have successfully broken the chain of transmission and have since remained free of SARS. However, the risk of importation of cases remains as long as cases are occurring anywhere in the world.\n\nThe visit to China is one in a series in which WHO officials, including the current Director-General, Dr Go Harlem Brundtland, and the Director-General elect, Dr J.W. Lee, confer with health authorities at SARS outbreak sites having the greatest experience to date.\n\nDr. Brundtland will be visiting Hong Kong SAR later this month.",

This represents an increase of 6 new cases and 3 deaths compared with yesterday.\n\nThe new cases occurred in Canada (5) and Taiwan (1). New deaths were reported in China (2) and Hong Kong (1).\n\nHealth authorities in some of the earliest areas to experience severe outbreaks are maintaining measures to protect against a resurgence of cases. Hong Kong authorities have announced their intention to maintain current screening procedures at all border points for at least one year.\n\nThe measures, which began at the end of March, include use of infrared temperature scanners at border points, and obligatory health declarations from all travellers. No new imported cases have occurred since these measures were introduced.\n\nHong Kong is also setting up a master list of imported cases. Approximately 6% of all SARS cases in Hong Kong are now thought to have been imported. To date, Hong Kong has experienced 1748 cases and 284 deaths, making it the second more severely hit area, with mainland China at the top.\n\nHong Kong shares a border with Guangdong Province, China. The disease was first brought to Hong Kong in late February when an infected medical doctor from the province spread the virus to at least 13 guests and visitors, all on the same floor of the hotel where he stayed. They carried the disease with them when they returned home, seeding the earliest outbreaks in Viet Nam, Singapore, and Toronto as well as Hong Kong.\n\nIn these initial outbreaks, SARS first took root in hospital settings, where staff, unaware that a new disease had surfaced and fighting to save the lives of patients, exposed themselves to the infectious agent without barrier protection. All of these initial outbreaks were subsequently characterized by chains of secondary transmission outside the health care setting.\n\nAt present, local chains of transmission are occurring only in Toronto and several parts of China. All other countries with imported cases have managed either to prevent transmission entirely or limit additional cases to very small numbers.",

Control currently depends on prompt detection and isolation of cases, good infection control in hospitals, and the tracing and quarantine of contacts.\n\nViet Nam has remained free of new SARS cases since 8 April. In Singapore, the last locally acquired probable case was isolated on 11 May. No new cases have since been detected in either country despite a high level of alert and aggressive investigation of all rumoured cases.\n\nThe experience in Toronto, where more than 70 new cases have been reported since 26 May, underscores the risk of a resurgence of cases and the constant need for vigilance. A single imported case can reignite an outbreak or bring cases to a new area, if preparedness measures are weak.\n\nThe new case reported today in Germany, in a man recently returned from Taiwan, has resulted in the quarantine of around 50 contacts.

        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "3 June 2003\n\nThe daily number of reported new probable cases of SARS in mainland China has declined considerably in recent weeks, from an average of 166 cases during the first week of May, to 90 cases during the second week, 27 cases in the third week, and 16 in the fourth week. Over the past 6 days, the daily number of reported new cases has dropped to an average of 2.5.\n\nAs in other areas with large and challenging SARS outbreaks, this progress over the past month demonstrates the decisive importance of high-level political commitment and determined application of control measures that have proven their effectiveness. At the same time, experiences elsewhere demonstrate the need for maintaining a vigilant and cautious approach to SARS, particularly in a country as large and diverse as China.\n\nThe resurgence of cases in Toronto demonstrates how difficult it can be to maintain control over a new disease characterized by many puzzling epidemiological and clinical features. The continued alertness of Singapore, which has most recently broken the chain of SARS transmission, demonstrates the importance of staying on guard, with a high level of vigilance and preparedness, to ensure that a single imported case does not reignite an outbreak.\n\nBased on recent experiences and the many uncertainties about the behaviour of SARS, WHO sees a need for caution in interpreting the downward trend in the number of reported new cases in China.\n\n\u201cSARS is still present in China, and WHO continues to regard China as the epicentre of SARS,\u201d said Dr David Heymann, Executive Director for Communicable Diseases at WHO. \u201cIt is our job, together with Chinese authorities, to try to prevent this disease from becoming permanently established in such a vast country.\u201d\n\nThe next few months will prove crucial in the attempt to contain SARS worldwide, which now greatly depends on whether the disease can be controlled in China. Otherwise, cases in China \u2013 with its long porous borders and large migrant populations \u2013 could seed outbreaks elsewhere and would thus make SARS a continuing threat for the rest of the world.\n\nDr Heymann believes that the international community has much to learn from Chinese experiences in controlling SARS, initially in Guangdong Province and increasingly in other parts of China. \u201cIt is also our job to work with the government to determine the factors that have led to such a rapid fall in SARS cases compared to other sites where outbreaks have occurred.\u201d\n\nWHO Director-General Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland has stressed the importance, for the security of all populations, of fully understanding the situation within any country experiencing an outbreak of a disease that can threaten neighbouring countries or be spread internationally by the travelling public. \u201cThis allows, within a country, for WHO to do what needs to be done to help the rest of the world,\u201d she said, speaking on a SARS-related issue during last week\u2019s World Health Assembly.\n\nAlthough great improvements in surveillance, reporting, infection control, and public awareness have occurred in China in recent weeks, WHO remains concerned about the sensitivity of case detection in some provinces, and about the capacity of the health infrastructure to cope with a challenge on the scale of SARS. A particular problem is the large number of new cases reported \u2013 approximately half \u2013 without information on the source or setting of exposure. The absence of this information makes it difficult for WHO to assess the extent of local transmission.\n\nLocal transmission of SARS, especially when it occurs outside a confined setting, such as the health care environment, is one measure of the risk of infection for both residents and international travellers. The pattern of local transmission is also an important consideration when WHO issues travel advice designed to prevent further international spread of SARS.",

        "Description of the Situation": "2 June 2003\n\nStatus of diagnostic tests The development of commercial diagnostic tests for SARS has progressed more slowly than initially hoped. Part of the problem arises from certain unusual features of SARS that make this disease an especially difficult scientific challenge.\n\nFor many viral diseases, the greatest quantities of the causative agent are excreted during the initial phase of illness, usually in the first few days following the onset of symptoms. This is often the period during which patients pose the greatest risk of infecting others.\n\nSARS, however, follows a different pattern. During the initial phase of illness, virus shedding is comparatively low. Virus shedding peaks in respiratory specimens and in stools at around 10 days after onset of clinical illness. In effect, this unusual behaviour creates the need for tests having a particularly high sensitivity.\n\nSuch tests do not yet exist. Because small quantities of the virus are initially shed, available tests, though developed with impressive speed, are unable reliably to detect SARS virus or its genetic material, during the earliest days of illness. The low sensitivity of current virus detection tests is a particular challenge for SARS control, as patients are capable of infecting others during the initial phase and therefore need to be reliably detected and quickly isolated.\n\nIn SARS patients, detectable immune responses do not begin until day 5 or 6. Reliable antibody tests can detect virus only by around day 10 following the onset of symptoms.\n\nWHO continues to recommend use of its case definitions, based on clinical presentation, distinct chest X-rays, and history of possible contact with SARS patients, to detect suspect and probable cases and make management decisions.\n\nTo expedite the development of better diagnostic tests, laboratories in the WHO collaborating network have made critical biological materials and reagents available to any laboratory having a sustained interest in the development of diagnostic tests, including the commercial sector. A comprehensive bank of clinical specimens, including respiratory specimens and samples of blood, urine, and faeces from SARS patients, has been established. The bank holds specimens representing all stages of the disease, ranging from the onset of symptoms to recovery.\n\nDuring the development of diagnostic tests, such specimens are needed to assess how well a test will perform with real patients specimens, as opposed to under the artificial conditions of a laboratory.\n\nSpecimens from the bank, which was set up by the Hong Kong Department of Health and the Hospital Authority, are being supplied by a collaborating laboratory, at no charge, to developers of diagnostic tests. As a sample from a single specimen can be subdivided into 6 to 8 identical sub-samples, laboratories can work in parallel on identical specimens, which will further facilitate the assessment of comparative performance. Identical samples also support standardization of diagnostic tests to ensure consistent accuracy.\n\nLaboratories in the WHO network have also made available standardizing reagents for virus and antibody tests. These reagents, which include samples of the inactivated virus and blood from patients in both acute and convalescent stages of illness, will allow uniform assessment of diagnostic results around the world against a \u201cgold standard\u201d.\n\nSera have been made available by collaborating laboratories in the United Kingdom and Hong Kong. Inactivated virus was prepared by the Bernard-Nocht Institute in Germany. Distribution of these reagents will be the responsibility of the Robert-Koch Institute, also in Germany. In return for the supply of these exclusive materials, recipients of WHO support have agreed to offer test kits, once available, at preferential prices to developing countries.\n\nTraining course in China WHO is currently coordinating a series of training courses in Beijing aimed at establishing an efficient laboratory infrastructure for SARS diagnosis in all provinces throughout China. Work of the WHO laboratory network has made it possible to support the training courses with test materials and reagents.\n\nTraining in the use of currently available tests is being provided by representatives of the labs where they were developed \u2013 thus ensuring that Chinese professionals benefit from the best first-hand experience the world can offer. Trainers come from laboratories in China, Hong Kong, the UK and the USA.\n\nChina has already developed a highly promising ELISA diagnostic test. For early detection of SARS virus, the PCR molecular test offers the greatest potential under average hospital conditions. The Singapore Genomic Institute has made its PCR test available, at no cost, to support SARS diagnosis in China.\n\nAlthough the number of new cases and deaths has declined considerably in mainland China, WHO and Chinese authorities remain concerned about the situation in some of the remote provinces which lack a sufficiently strong health infrastructure, including surveillance and reporting systems and hospital facilities, for responding to the magnitude of the SARS problem.\n\nUpdate on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 8384 probable cases and 770 deaths has been reported from 29 countries. This represents an increase of 27 new cases and deaths compared with the last report on Saturday. The new deaths were reported in China (2) and Hong Kong (4).",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "30 May 2003\n\nEffective Saturday 31 May, Singapore will be removed from the list of areas with recent local transmission of SARS. The change in status comes 20 days after the last locally acquired case was placed in isolation, on 11 May.\n\nThe 20-day period represents twice the maximum incubation period \u2013 a reliable indication, following established epidemiological principles, that a chain of transmission has been broken.\n\nIn an outstanding example of prompt and open reporting, the 11 May case was reported to WHO on the very day when Singapore was initially scheduled to come off the list.\n\n\u201cFrom the start, Singapore\u2019s handling of its SARS outbreak has been exemplary,\u201d said Dr David Heymann, Executive Director for Communicable Diseases at WHO. \u201cThis is an inspiring victory that should make all of us optimistic that SARS can be contained everywhere.\u201d\n\nAlthough continued vigilance, especially to prevent the importation of cases, is extremely important, WHO no longer recommends exit screening of international travellers departing from Singapore, effective tomorrow. The absence of local transmission for twice the incubation period means that neither residents nor travellers are at risk of acquiring SARS in Singapore.\n\nManagement of the Singapore outbreak faced a number of especially difficult challenges. The first cases of an unusual form of pneumonia were reported on 9 March. At that time, SARS had not yet been recognized as a new disease easily spread in hospitals. As a result, hospital staff were unaware of the need to isolate patients and protect themselves.\n\nThe virus initially spread rapidly among hospital staff, patients, visitors, and their close family contacts. Later on, spread of infection between hospitals occurred when patients with underlying disease \u2013 which masked the tell-tale symptoms of SARS \u2013 were transferred to other hospitals, placed in rooms with other patients, and managed without adequate protective equipment.\n\nThe outbreak in Singapore was further amplified by several so-called \u201csuper-spreaders\u201d. These are individuals who, for as yet unexplained reasons, are highly efficient in spreading the virus to others. For example, the disease was brought to Singapore by a young women who stayed on the same floor of Hong Kong\u2019s Metropole Hotel at the same time, during late February, as a medical doctor from Guangdong Province, China. This person, who was the first to carry the SARS virus out of mainland China, infected at least 13 other hotel guests and visitors. Back home in Singapore, the young woman subsequently infected 23 others.\n\nWhen the SARS virus moved into the community, it did so through an infected vegetable hawker at a crowded wholesale market. Swift action by the government, including closing of the market, contact tracing, and quarantining of more than 400 persons, limited the spread of infection to only 15 other persons.\n\nAltogether, 144 of Singapore\u2019s 206 probable cases have been linked to contact with only 5 individuals.\n\nIn a few cases, SARS transmission occurred in situations, such as taxis, elevators, and hospital corridors, where exposure may have been through a route other than face-to-face contact with infected droplets. This unusual pattern necessitated an expanded policy for contact tracing and home quarantine.\n\nHealth authorities responded to all these challenges with extraordinary measures, adjusting strategies as each new problem emerged.\n\nIn an official communication from the Ministry of Health, sent on 29 May, WHO was informed that investigations had identified the source of infection for all but one of the country\u2019s total number of cases.\n\nThis is only one achievement in an outbreak response consistently characterized by extra precautions and extraordinary determination.\n\nSurveillance in Singapore uses a highly sensitive case definition that picks up for investigation and monitoring virtually every person with symptoms that might possibly indicate SARS, regardless of whether the person has been in contact with a SARS patient. An independent hospital-based surveillance system monitors for cases of pneumonia acquired outside the hospital setting. This \u201cwide net\u201d approach may help explain why so few cases have escaped detection and why the time between onset of symptoms and isolation has been so much shorter in Singapore, reducing opportunities for further spread.\n\nLocal transmission is of greatest concern when a new case cannot be traced back to another case, or when a symptomatic case circulates in the community for several days prior to isolation\n\nSingapore used its military forces to assist in contact tracing and enforcement of home quarantine. All persons who were household, social, hospital, and occupational contacts during the 10 days before symptom onset were traced to identify the source of infection. Persons identified as having had contact with a SARS patient from onset of symptoms to date of isolation were placed in home quarantine.\n\nOther measures include screening of passengers at the airport and seaports, concentration of patients in a single SARS-designated hospital, imposition of a no-visitors rule for all public hospitals, and use of a dedicated private ambulance service to transport all possible cases to the SARS-designated hospital.\n\nIn addition, management of the outbreak benefited from support from high-quality laboratory services, including the Virology Unit, Singapore General Hospital, which is a member of the WHO laboratory network.\n\nOne indication of the effectiveness of these measures is the fact that 80% of Singapore\u2019s SARS cases did not transmit the infection to others.\n\nTaken together, these efforts have made Singapore a place safe from the risk of SARS for both residents and visitors.\n\nExperiences elsewhere underscore the importance of maintaining a high level of vigilance. WHO is confident that vigilance and preparedness to act will continue in Singapore. On 6 June, the Ministry of Health will hold a border meeting with officials in Malaysia to discuss measures for keeping Singapore free of imported cases.",

        "Description of the Situation": "29 May 2003\n\nSituation in ChinaChina has today reported 3 new probable SARS cases, all in Beijing. All 3 patients had previously been classified as suspect cases and were already hospitalized.\n\nWHO is cautiously optimistic that outbreaks in mainland China are being brought under control in provinces with good surveillance and reporting systems and good infection control in hospitals.\n\nWHO officials in China report that the use of air conditioning in public places is being discontinued in an effort to prevent the further spread of SARS. WHO has no evidence to date that air-conditioning could play a role in spreading the SARS virus. All evidence indicates that the predominant mode of spread is through close person-to-person contact with droplets expelled when an infected person coughs or sneezes.\n\nFor the purpose of infection control, and exclusively in hospital settings, WHO does recommend turning off air-conditioning and opening windows to provide ventilation. This option is recommended only when the preferred options of negative pressure rooms or an independent air supply and exhaust system cannot be met.\n\nA WHO expert who recently assessed the SARS situation in Shanghai reports that the city has taken many steps to stem the spread of SARS. While the screening of air passengers is progressing well, implementation of a similar level of screening at Shanghai\u2019s bus and railway stations is proving logistically more difficult. Local authorities are also implementing numerous temperature checks; these may occasionally be performed at an excessive frequency.\n\nWHO teams in China are still investigating how best to implement monitoring procedures in the country\u2019s rural areas. Local officials are prepared to adopt a community-based surveillance system. However, exactly which measures will prove most effective remains to be determined. WHO teams hope to visit other SARS \u201chot spots\u201d in China, such as Tianjin and Shanxi.\n\nUpdate on cases and countries\nAs of today, a cumulative total of 8295 cases with 750 deaths has been reported from 28 countries. This represents an increase of 17 new cases and 5 new deaths compared with yesterday. The new deaths occurred in China (2) and Hong Kong SAR (3).",

        "Description of the Situation": "28 May 2003\n\nSituation in Taiwan\n\nTaiwan has today reported 22 new probable cases of SARS and 5 new deaths, marking the continuation of a downward trend that became apparent earlier this week. Throughout last week, the large number of new cases reported daily was due, in part, to a change in reporting procedures, as hundreds of patients in a \"pending\" category were investigated and then either excluded or reclassified as suspect or probable cases. For this reason, many cases reported for the first time on a given day actually had dates of onset several days earlier. The record number of newly reported cases occurred last Thursday, when 65 probable cases were added to the list.\n\nWith the backlog of pending cases now cleared, the low number of genuine new cases reported today (22) and yesterday (13) indicates that the outbreak in Taiwan has begun to decline.\n\nThis welcome development can be attributed to improved infection control in hospitals, including better procedures in emergency rooms and use of protective equipment. A good level of screening, aimed at detecting and isolating patients promptly, is also working to make hospitals safe for patients and staff. These activities reinforce standardized infection control procedures in place throughout the island.\n\nTo date, more than 90% of SARS cased in Taiwan have been linked to the hospital setting.\n\nHigh-profile public awareness campaigns were launched earlier to improve public understanding of SARS, with emphasis placed on good personal hygiene, frequent temperature checks, and prompt reporting of fevers. An island-wide telephone hotline and call centre, staffed by doctors and nurses, has been implemented.\n\nTaiwan has established around 100 fever clinics and will soon be opening more. These facilities ease overcrowding in emergency rooms as more and more concerned residents seek urgent medical attention. The clinics also reduce opportunities for contact with more severely ill persons who might be affected by SARS.\n\nA programme for monitoring and evaluation of all SARS-related control activities has been designed and will be implemented shortly. With these measures in place, WHO is confident that the number of cases in Taiwan will continue the present decline, as has been the experience at other outbreak sites.\n\nTo date, Taiwan has reported a cumulative total of 610 probable cases and 81 deaths. The outbreak began to escalate near the end of April, when a lapse in infection control at a hospital is thought to have resulted in a large number of new exposures that spread to new sites as patients were transferred to other hospitals. The number of probable cases reached 100 on 2 May, grew to 207 on 13 May, and passed the 300 mark on 19 May. Two days later, Taiwan reported 418 cases, and on 23 May, 538 cases.\n\nThis rapid growth in reported cases, partly caused by the clearing of hundreds of cases in the backlog, has now slowed. In this sense, Taiwanese health officials have \"caught up\" with the outbreak and are now much closer to bringing SARS under control.\nUpdate on cases and countries\n\nAs of today, a cumulative total of 8240 probable cases with 745 deaths has been reported from 28 countries. This represents an increase of 30 new cases and 10 deaths compared with yesterday. The new deaths occurred in China (4), Hong Kong SAR (1), and Taiwan (5).",

        "Description of the Situation": "27 May 2003\nDisease Outbreak Reported\nSARS resolution approved, situation in Taiwan\n\nWorld Health Assembly adopts resolution on SARSToday in Geneva, more than 190 countries participating in the World Health Assembly \u2013 the supreme governing body of WHO \u2013 unanimously approved a resolution on SARS. The Assembly also considered  a report (.pdf)on the emergence and spread of SARS and on the international response to date.\n\nThe text of the resolution was based on a draft proposed by a group of Asian countries, and then fine-tuned during more than 7 hours of collaborative work by 37 nations. The group was chaired by Dr Viroj Tangcharoensathien, a senior member of Thailand\u2019s Ministry of Public Health.\n\nThe resolution, which recognizes SARS as \u201cthe first severe infectious disease to emerge in the twenty-first century\u201d, calls for the full support of all countries to control SARS and other emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. It also urges countries \u201cto report cases promptly and transparently and to provide requested information to WHO.\u201d Countries are further asked to request WHO support when \u201ccontrol measures employed are ineffective in halting the spread of disease.\u201d\n\nIn the resolution and in the debate that preceded its adoption, SARS was clearly recognized as a serious threat to the stability and growth of economies, the livelihood of populations, and the functioning of health systems as well as a cause of great human suffering. Lessons learned in the ongoing response to SARS were considered relevant to improved preparedness for the next new disease, the next influenza pandemic, and a possible act of bioterrorism.\n\nWhile WHO was asked to continue to update the list of areas with recent local transmission of SARS, the resolution acknowledges the need to do so in a way that minimizes the socioeconomic consequences.\n\nA statement made by the Italian delegation, praising the dedication of all health care workers, including several who have lost their lives to SARS, met with a round of applause.\n\nIn a related item, also considered today, delegates approved a resolution setting out procedures and a timetable for revision of the International Health Regulations. The Regulations, which are administered by WHO, provide the legal framework for global surveillance and reporting of infectious diseases. They also provide the only mechanism through which measures to prevent international spread can be enforced.\n\nBasically unchanged since 1969, the Regulations are considered grossly inadequate in protecting nations and the international community against the resurgence of the infectious disease threat, which has resulted in the emergence of around 30 new diseases during the past two decades. As many speakers noted, this threat, dramatically illustrated by SARS, is amplified by conditions in a highly mobile, interconnected, and closely interdependent world.\n\nAs the revision process will not be completed before 2005, the resolution adopted by consensus today requests WHO, through its Director-General, to take into account information about epidemics from sources other than official government notifications, and to conduct on-the-spot studies within countries to ensure that control measures are adequate to prevent international spread. These newly authorized functions are expected to strengthen WHO\u2019s capacity to respond to outbreaks and epidemics quickly and with sufficient force to prevent spread to neighbouring countries and others.\n\nSituation in Taiwan A WHO official in Taiwan has today reported important strides forward in strengthening hospital infection control and contact tracing. Health officials have launched a widespread information campaign, set up a major screening programme and established fever clinics to keep persons suspected of having SARS out of contact with others. In the assessment of WHO, these efforts are beginning to bear fruit. The situation in Taiwan is expected to improve gradually in the coming days and weeks.\n\nThirteen new probable cases and 4 new deaths were reported today from Taiwan.\n\nUpdate on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 8221 probable SARS cases with 735 deaths has been reported from 28 countries. This represents an increase of 24 new cases and 10 deaths compared with yesterday. The new deaths occurred in China (4), Hong Kong SAR (2), and Taiwan (4).",

        "Description of the Situation": "26 May 2003\n\nSituation in Toronto WHO has today added Toronto, Canada to the list of areas with recent local transmission of SARS. The change in status follows information, communicated by Health Canada, about new clusters of 26 suspect and 8 probable cases of SARS linked to 4 Toronto hospitals.\n\nAs a precautionary measure, all cases in the clusters are being treated as possibly representing SARS until proven otherwise. Actions being taken include immediate isolation of all cases, heightened infection control, intensive contact tracing, and voluntary home quarantine of contacts. These measures have proved highly effective in quickly containing outbreaks.\n\nAn urgent alert was sent on Friday to all health and long-term care facilities and service providers in Toronto. Potential exposures include staff, patients, and visitors at the four hospitals.\n\nAlthough the results of laboratory and epidemiological investigations are pending, sufficient information is available to determine that the index, or first, case in the present outbreak has transmitted infection to others in more than one generation of local transmission. Toronto is therefore classified as having \u201cpattern B\u201d transmission. This is defined as more than one generation of local probable SARS cases.\n\nInclusion of countries and areas in this list, which is stratified according to three patterns of transmission, does not mean that WHO recommends travel restrictions to the country or area.\n\nAt present, WHO is not recommending any restrictions on travel to Toronto.\n\nLocal transmission of SARS is of greatest concern, in terms of risks to both local populations and international travellers, when a new case cannot be traced back to contact with another case, or turns out to have been a contact of a case but was not placed in isolation. Both situations increase opportunities for local spread to others.\n\nThe table listing areas with recent local transmission is updated daily to assist in the identification and reporting of SARS cases. Pending the development of robust and reliable diagnostic tests, a history of recent travel to an area with local transmission of SARS is part of the WHO case definitions for both suspect and probable cases.\n\nOn 23 April, WHO advised persons planning to travel to Toronto to consider postponing all but essential travel. This recommendation was lifted on 30 April, following epidemiological evidence that the outbreak had been controlled to an extent that travellers were no longer at risk.\n\nOn 14 May, Toronto was removed from the list of areas with recent local transmission and from the list of areas for which WHO has issued recommendations pertaining to international travel. Criteria for removal from the list include no new probable cases for 20 days, which is twice the incubation period. When no new cases occur over a 20-day period, the chain of transmission is considered broken and the outbreak controlled.\n\nInterpretation of \u201careas with recent local transmission\u201d The list of areas with recent local transmission is issued by WHO to facilitate use of the SARS case definitions to detect and report suspect and probable cases. A recent history of travel to an area where local transmission outside a confined setting, such as the health care environment, is occurring can assist physicians in the interpretation of symptoms in international travellers.\n\nUpdate on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 8202 probable cases with 725 deaths has been reported from 28 countries. This represents an increase of 96 probable cases and 29 deaths compared with the most recent report on Saturday. The new deaths occurred in Canada (3), China (9), Hong Kong SAR (5), and Taiwan (12).\n\nTaiwan, reporting 62 probable cases over the past two days, continues to have the most rapidly growing outbreak. With a cumulative total of 585 probable cases, Taiwan now has more than twice the caseload of Singapore (206 probable cases), which was among the most severely affected initial outbreak sites.",

These and other wild animals are traditionally considered delicacies and are sold for human consumption in markets throughout southern China.\n\nAll six of the civets included in the study were found to harbour SARS coronavirus isolated in cell culture or detected by a PCR molecular technique. The animals also seroconverted and their sera inhibited the growth of SARS coronavirus isolated from humans. Vice versa, human serum from SARS patients inhibited the growth of SARS isolates from these animals.\n\nSequencing of viruses isolated from these animals demonstrated that, with the exception of a small additional sequence, the viruses are identical with the human SARS virus.\n\nInformation on the potential role of animals in the transmission of SARS is important to overall understanding of SARS. Much more research is needed before any firm conclusions can be reached. At present, no evidence exists to suggest that these wild animal species play a significant role in the epidemiology of SARS outbreaks. However, it cannot be ruled out that these animals might have been a source of human infection.\n\nAs a precautionary measure, persons who might come into contact with these species or their products, including body fluids and excretions, should be aware of the possible health risks, particularly during close contact such as handling and slaughtering and possibly food processing and consumption.\n\nThe study provides a first indication that the SARS virus exists outside a human host. However, many fundamental questions remain. Samples were taken from one market only. Studies need to determine how widespread the SARS virus might be in animals in Guangdong and elsewhere, and if these animals can excrete virus in an amount sufficient to infect humans. Furthermore, the possibility of animal-to-animal transmission has to be investigated. For example, the presence of virus could result from consumption of an infected prey.\n\nUpdate on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 8117 probable cases with 689 deaths have been reported from 28 countries. This represents an increase of 77 new cases and 7 deaths when compared with yesterday. The new deaths occurred in China (3), Hong Kong (2), and Singapore (2).\n\nMost of the new cases were reported in Taiwan, China. With 55 new cases reported today, Taiwan now has a cumulative total of 538 probable cases, making it the third most severe outbreak site to date.",

        "Description of the Situation": "22 May 2003 Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 8046 probable SARS cases and 682 deaths have been reported from 28 countries. These figures represent an increase of 95 new cases and 16 deaths when compared with yesterday. The new deaths occurred in China (4), Hong Kong SA (3), Taiwan (8), and Singapore (1).\n\nThe cumulative total of probable cases surpassed 5000 on 28 April, 6000 on 2 May, and 7000 on 8 May.\n\nSituation in Taiwan Taiwan authorities have today reported a record 60 new probable cases of SARS and 8 deaths, bringing the cumulative totals to 483 cases and 60 deaths. However, the large daily increases in new cases seen over the past week are due to a backlog in the investigation of pending cases and determination of which fit the case definition for probable SARS.\n\nWhile the daily numbers of new cases indicate the size of the SARS outbreak in Taiwan, which is worrisome, they do not suggest an explosive escalation in the number of cases, as both older and new cases are being reported together on a daily basis. At present, the daily increases reflect a change in the way records have been kept, with cases in a \u201cpending\u201d category now being classified as either suspect or probable cases. As the backlog of pending cases is now being rapidly cleared, the daily reports should begin within days to give a more accurate picture of the evolution of the outbreak in Taiwan.\n\nSince detection of its first suspect cases, Taiwan has promptly reported on the outbreak to WHO. The first two cases, who were hospitalized on 8 March, occurred in a man with a recent travel history to Guangdong Province and Hong Kong, and his wife, who had no recent travel history. The cases were officially recognized as suspect SARS cases on 14 March, two days after WHO issued a global alert about the emergence of a new disease with severe respiratory symptoms. A team from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, organized by WHO\u2019s Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, arrived in Taiwan on 16 March.\n\nTaiwan initially experienced a gradual increase in the number of cases. As of 18 April, 29 cases had been reported. All were identified, through contact tracing and investigation of travel history, as either imported cases, cases in persons with a recent travel history to areas with local transmission, and family members and other close contacts of patients. The number of cases began to climb at the end of April, when local transmission in hospitals became the source of the majority of new infections. The number of probable cases reached 100 on 2 May, grew to 207 on 13 May, and now stands at 483.\n\nTaiwan has now received supplementary protective equipment shipped urgently from Thailand yesterday. The problem of infection control in hospitals is being addressed as a top priority. Procedures were set up today to ensure rapid and efficient distribution of the new equipment.\n\nWHO will be sending an additional 2 staff from Geneva to Taiwan over the weekend.\n\nData on in-flight transmission updated Following receipt of more complete data, WHO is updating its statistics on cases of in-flight transmission of SARS. The number of flights during which transmission of SARS may have occurred remains at four. The total number of cases resulting from exposure during these four flights has been revised to 27. One flight alone, CA112, which flew from Hong Kong to Beijing on 15 March, is now know to have accounted for 22 of the 27 cases.\n\nWHO is aware of an additional 31 flights with symptomatic probable SARS cases on board. No evidence indicates that in-flight transmission occurred on any of these flights. No flights have been implicated in the transmission of SARS after 23 March 2003.\n\nComplete data on seating information for all cases has not been obtained. However, it is now known that, on one flight, persons sitting seven rows in front and five row behind a person with symptomatic SARS developed the disease. WHO is aware of four flight attendants, of which two were on the CA112 flight, who have become infected.\n\nReport from the joint team in Henan Province, China \u201cCommunity-based surveillance and control methods seem to be an important contributor to the apparently low levels of SARS infection in China\u2019s rural countryside,\u201d Dr. James Maguire says. Dr Maguire returned to Beijing three days ago from a six-day visit to China\u2019s Henan Province. He travelled as part of a joint Ministry of Health-WHO team. The group visited hospitals, clinics and basic health facilities in five prefectures in Henan.\n\nA full report of the team\u2019s findings is being prepared and will soon be released.\n\nDr Maguire says that numerous checkpoints on roads and at train and bus stations, where identification cards are checked and body temperatures recorded, seem to be an effective way of controlling the spread of SARS. \u201cThe fear of the disease is widespread. Combined with community surveillance and social and legal pressure, people are cooperating,\u201d he says.\n\nHenan officials told the investigators around 1.4 million workers had returned to the province during the long holiday period around May 1. Many came from areas with higher rates of SARS infection, like Beijing and Guangdong. During the period from 26 April to 15 May, the team was told that at the checkpoints 12,028 people were found to be feverish and 955 had a cough. They were referred to \u201cfever clinics\u201d \u2013 basic triage centers where they were put into single-room isolation for further assessment. \u201cWe were told that nine of these cases were confirmed as being infected with SARS and eight were suspected cases,\u201d Dr Maguire says.\n\nMinistry of Health statistics show there were 15 probable cases, including one in a health worker, and six suspect cases of SARS reported from Henan province as of May 22.\n\nUsually, returning workers from affected areas must stay under house quarantine for 15 days, staying apart from their family in a single room. Dr Maguire says to help with farming work, some local governments are offering financial assistance to have hired workers perform the necessary fieldwork or grants to enable people to buy farm machinery to lower the demand for human farm labour.\n\n\u201cThe screening at checkpoints and quarantining may seem like hitting a fly with a hammer, but they seem to be working,\u201d Dr Maguire says. \u201cCombined with the extreme social pressure brought on by the fear of SARS, China might have hit on a way to fight the spread of the disease.\u201d",

        "Description of the Situation": "21 May 2003  Note for the Press\n\nAs a result of ongoing assessments as to the nature of outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), WHO is now recommending, as a measure of precaution, that people planning to travel to Taiwan province, China, consider postponing all but essential travel. This is an extension of the advice issued on 8 May recommending the postponing of non-essential travel to Taipei, and is based on information received by the WHO detailing the spread of SARS beyond that city. This temporary travel advice will be reassessed regularly.\n\nFollowing global alerts about SARS, issued by WHO on 12 and 15 March, national authorities have heightened surveillance for suspect and probable cases. In many countries, prompt detection and isolation of initial cases have prevented further transmission altogether or held additional cases to a very small number. On 27 March, WHO recommended additional measures aimed at preventing the travel-related spread of SARS. These recommended measures, which include the screening of air passengers departing from areas with recent local transmission of SARS, continue to apply. (see SARS site )\n\nInformation about the magnitude of the SARS outbreaks in Taiwan province, China, has been carefully reviewed by WHO. The travel advice is based on a consideration of the magnitude of the outbreaks in the area, including both the number of prevalent cases and the daily number of new cases. The extent of local chains of transmission as well as the potential for spread beyond these areas were also major factors in the reasoning for this advice.\n\nWHO travel advice is issued to protect international public health and to reduce opportunities for further global spread. SARS is a new disease, first recognized in late February, that has spread along the routes of international air travel. Precautionary measures aim to reduce the impact of SARS and contain the disease while it is still in a relatively early stage.\n\nThe SARS situation is assessed on a regular basis to determine whether the status of areas listed for travel advice needs to be modified, whether other areas need to be added, and if additional precautionary measures are required. Current travel advice, whereby WHO recommends that people consider postponing all but essential travel, are now in effect for several areas of China, namely: Beijing, Hong Kong, Guangdong, Hebei, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Taiwan and Tianjin.\n\nFor more information contact:\n\nDick Thompson - Communication Officer Communicable Diseases WHO, Geneva  Telephone: (+41 22) 791 26 84 Email: [email\u00a0protected]",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "20 May 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported\nPhilippines removed from list of areas with recent local transmission\n\nWHO has today removed the Philippines from its list of areas with recent local transmission of SARS. The last probable case that was locally acquired was isolated on 30 April, meaning that opportunities for spread of the virus to others were significantly reduced. As 20 days have now passed with no further cases detected, WHO can safely conclude that local transmission has been interrupted. The twenty days represent twice the maximum incubation period \u2013 a reliable indication, following established epidemiological principles, that a chain of transmission has been broken.\n\nTo date, the Philippines Department of Health has reported a total of 12 probable SARS cases to WHO. All have been promptly and extensively investigated by local officials, and all have been linked to source cases. Of the 12 SARS cases, 5 were imported. One of the imported cases, who carried the disease from Toronto, infected 7 other cases in the only chain of secondary transmission that has occurred in the Philippines. Of the 7 secondary cases, all have been identified as either family members of the index case or health care workers who treated the index case or her father, both of whom died. These are the only 2 SARS deaths reported in the Philippines.\n\nThe SARS situation in the Philippines illustrates the scale of the emergency effort needed to respond effectively to an imported case and ensure that an outbreak is swiftly contained, keeping the number of secondary cases small. The imported case travelled to 5 provinces prior to hospitalization. Contract tracing identified 250 casual and close contacts who were closely followed up. Four of these developed fever and were quarantined until a diagnosis of SARS was excluded.\n\nThe Department of Health has today reported to WHO that active surveillance has been ongoing since 17 March to detect and investigate any new SARS cases in 16 regions of the Philippines. All regions report daily on whether any suspect cases have been identified. A report of a suspect case initiates immediate contact tracing and, when necessary, quarantine measures.\n\nThe efficient surveillance and reporting system in the Philippines, which reflects strong political commitment and a high level of awareness among health staff, confers an additional level of assurance that no local transmission is now occurring.\n\nWHO has never advised that travel to the Philippines be restricted.\n\nThe list of areas with recent local transmission is issued by WHO to facilitate use of the SARS case definition to detect and report suspect and probable cases. A recent history of travel to an area where local transmission outside a confined setting, such as the health care environment, has been documented can help physicians assess symptoms of illness in international travellers.\n\nIn the absence of a robust and reliable laboratory diagnostic test, WHO continues to recommend that these cases definitions be used to identify SARS cases and guide appropriate management decisions.\n\nUpdate on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 7919 probable cases with 662 deaths have been reported from 28 countries. This represents an increase of 60 new cases and 19 deaths when compared with yesterday.\n\nThe new deaths occurred in China (5), Hong Kong SAR (2), and Taiwan (12). Taiwan, with 39 new probable cases reported today, also has the highest number of new cases",

        "Description of the Situation": "19 May 2003\nDisease Outbreak Reported\nReport on Guangxi (China) visit, situation in Taiwan, risk of SARS transmission during air travel\n\nReport on Guangxi (China) visit Guangxi Province appears to be responding well to its relatively small SARS outbreak, with the disease given high priority by both populations and health officials. This conclusion was reached by WHO experts following a joint field visit with Ministry of Health officials. To date, Guangxi has reported 22 probable SARS cases and 3 deaths.\n\nSome concern had been expressed that this \u201cpoverty province\u201d, with its weak health infrastructure, would not be able to cope with a SARS outbreak. \u201cWe found the province well mobilized. There appears to be no major epidemic there,\u201d said WHO team leader CK Lee. The team returned last Saturday to Beijing after a week-long visit in the province.\n\nExperts found an effective surveillance system set up to detect cases. Diagnostic procedures, treatment, and infection control at all hospitals visited was considered adequate. While no evidence of concealment of cases was found, the numbers of probable SARS cases could be higher due to problems with how cases are being defined.\n\nThe team found that two separate clusters of SARS cases, dating from December and January, had recently been detected by local health officials following a review of hospital records.\n\nGuangxi\u2019s surveillance system, which is similar to that of Hebei Province, relies on active, rigorous community-based surveillance, close checking of migrants returning home, and quarantine for two weeks in certain cases. An adequate case reporting system has been set up, with detailed reports sent daily from each city or prefecture to the provincial level.\n\nAccording to official records, some 260,000 migrant workers returned to Guangxi between April 1 and May 8, of whom 200,000 workers came from neighbouring Guangdong province. Surveillance checkpoints have been set up at main entry points into the province to register these workers. Screening teams staffed by township hospital doctors also visit villages to monitor returning workers.\n\nHospital management appeared to be effective. Due to scrupulous infection control, no health care workers have been reported as infected. However, some measures taken may be unwarranted, unsustainable or even inappropriate. For example, health care workers are using three layers of hats, gowns, gloves and masks. Two of the three masks are made up of a 12-layer gauze material.\n\nExperts are also concerned that the numbers of reported cases may be low, due to how cases are being classified under the probable, suspect and \u201cunder observation\u201d categories. WHO experts are further investigating this issue and working with the Ministry of Health to bring the national standard case definitions more in line with WHO case definitions.\n\nIn a separate development, WHO has requested that joint research be undertaken to investigate the origins of the coronavirus to predict its possible reintroduction into the community.\n\nSituation in Taiwan Taiwan has today reported a cumulative total of 344 probable SARS cases with 40 deaths. On 17 May Taiwan reported 34 new cases, and 36 new cases were reported the following day, making Taiwan the most rapidly growing outbreak at present.\n\nAs the SARS situation in Taiwan has evolved quickly, with cases now being reported in at least six hospitals, it is possible that the large number of cases being reported daily represents a backlog of cases that are only now being recognized as SARS.\n\nLapses in infection control, particularly in emergency rooms, may have been one reason for the rapid increase in cases, particularly in hospitals.\n\nLocal authorities are focusing on improving their infection control measures. Cases are now less likely to go unrecognized in emergency rooms, many of which have been reorganized to minimize the risk of further SARS transmission. A new monitoring system will also establish guidelines and procedures for the assignment of hospital beds in isolation wards.\n\nThe department of health has established a 24-hour case reporting system to handle SARS reports made by physicians and hospitals. Delays in case reporting are punishable by law, and in the severest cases, subject to imprisonment.\n\nTaiwan authorities have adopted thorough contact tracing and quarantine measures to prevent further spread. The joint WHO-CDC team in Taiwan is working to ensure that detailed practical guidelines, developed by Hong Kong, Singapore, and other successful initial outbreak sites, are being made available to Taiwanese authorities. In particular, guidance on the safe screening of persons presenting with fever, and advice on policies for home quarantine and prevention of spread within schools are being shared by teams at other outbreak sites.\n\nOfficials in Kaohsiung, Taiwan\u2019s second largest city, have adopted contingency plans for the city, county and region. Should Kaohsiung exceed the simulated level of preparedness, the next level involves military intervention. The city\u2019s level of preparedness in hospitals appears to be good\n\nWHO is confident that Taiwan will bring the outbreak under control using methods of case detection, isolation and good infection control in hospitals, vigorous contact tracing and follow-up surveillance, and public education and information that have proven their effectiveness in other areas. Additional WHO support staff will be sent to Taiwan soon.\n\nRisk of SARS transmission during air travel Globally, WHO has analysed information, as of 12 May, on 35 flights in which a probable symptomatic SARS case was among the passengers or crew. To date, symptomatic probable SARS cases on four of these flights have been associated with possible transmission of infection to fellow passengers or crew.\n\nThe most recent flight during which SARS may have been transmitted from a probable symptomatic case to another fellow passenger, seated next to each other, occurred on 23 March during a flight from Bangkok to Beijing.\n\nOn 27 March, WHO issued recommendations for the screening of air passengers departing from areas with recent local transmission. In some areas that have experienced severe SARS outbreaks, including Hong Kong SAR and Singapore, measures being applied at airports exceed those recommended by WHO. In these areas, prompt detection and isolation of cases, and rigorous tracing and home confinement or quarantine of all contacts have served as the first line of protection against the risk that an infectious person could board an aircraft. Stringent measures for export screening confer yet another level of protection.\n\nUpdate on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 7864 probable SARS cases with 643 deaths have been reported from 28 countries. This represents an increase of 116 new cases and 20 deaths when compared with the last global update on Saturday.\n\nThe new deaths occurred in China (7), Hong Kong (8), and Taiwan (5).",

        "Description of the Situation": "17 May 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported\nFirst global consultation on SARS epidemiology, travel recommendations for Hebei Province (China), situation in Singapore\n\nFirst global consultation on SARS epidemiology The first global consultation on SARS epidemiology, held at WHO headquarters in Geneva from 16 to 17 May, concluded its work today. The meeting united face-to-face and via video and audio linkage more than 40 leading epidemiologists from 16 countries, including representatives from all areas experiencing significant outbreaks and from WHO teams at these sites.\n\nThe meeting was convened to answer a series of fundamental questions important to understanding the dynamics of SARS transmission in populations and the appropriateness of currently recommended measures for control. As SARS is a new disease and outbreaks are evolving, such consultations are needed to ensure that WHO\u2019s global recommendations reflect the latest and best scientific knowledge.\n\nParticipants reviewed data from a number of recently completed and ongoing investigations, and exchanged first-hand experiences. Data were presented on the incubation period, the period during which patients are infectious, and case fatality ratios. Participants also exchanged views on routes of transmission and the question of whether subclinical infection contributes to SARS transmission. To date, no reports indicate that persons without symptoms have transmitted SARS to others. In addition, no reports indicate that SARS has an animal host or reservoir in the environment.\n\nThe experts confirmed that control measures, currently recommended by WHO, are supported by the available evidence on key epidemiological determinants. The maximum incubation period used for control purposes has proven effective. Participants confirmed that the overall case fatality ratio is 14% to 15% but with wide variations in case fatality related to age, sex, the presence of other diseases, and treatment protocols, and pointed to the need for more research on the significance of infection in immunocompromised persons or persons with underlying cardiorespiratory disease. The experts further supported the current WHO recommendation that persons who have an acute febrile respiratory illness should not travel.\n\nQuestions identified as requiring urgent attention include the vulnerability of children to infection, the proportion of contacts of SARS patients who develop asymptomatic infection, and the significance of contact with SARS cases in confined settings such as aircraft and hospitals.\n\nWHO was asked to review guidelines for hospital cleaning and disinfection, to conduct case studies of individuals who appear to make a special contribution to the spread of SARS, to establish the case fatality ratio for health care workers, and to coordinate international collaborative research on SARS in pregnancy.\n\nParticipants from the main outbreak sites noted the striking similarity of the pattern of outbreaks in different countries and the consistent effectiveness of specific control measures, including early identification and isolation of patients, vigorous contact tracing, management of close contacts by home confinement or quarantine, and public information and education to encourage prompt reporting of symptoms. The effectiveness of these measures was observed in all outbreak sites under widely varying conditions, supporting the overall WHO view that SARS can be contained and driven back out of its new human host.\n\nThe outcome of the meeting will be a consensus document that will serve as both the foundation for recommended control measures and a basis for national authorities in non-affected countries to develop preparedness and management plans. Such plans help ensure that infrastructure and mechanisms are in place to prevent an outbreak should importation of a case occur.\n\nThe meeting was characterized by a spirit of frank and open exchange of data, experiences, and expert opinion. As several participants noted, global collaboration in an intense research effort is needed, as no single country can manage SARS on its own.\n\nTravel recommendations for Hebei Province (China) WHO is today recommending that persons planning to travel to Hebei Province, China consider postponing all but essential travel. The temporary recommendation is based on the magnitude of the outbreak in Hebei, including the number of prevalent cases and the number of new cases reported daily, and evidence that local chains of transmission are occurring outside a confined setting, such as the health care environment. Together, these factors increase the risk that travellers to Hebei could become infected and subsequently export the disease elsewhere.\n\nSimilar travel advice is currently in effect for Hong Kong SAR and Taipei and for several areas of mainland China, including Beijing, Guangdong, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, and Tianjin.\n\nTo date, Hebei has reported a cumulative total of 202 probable cases and 10 deaths.\n\nRecommendations to international travellers are one of several measures being used by WHO to reduce opportunities for the further international spread of SARS.\n\nSituation in Singapore The Ministry of Health in Singapore has today determined that the cluster of patients and staff in the Institute of Mental Health who developed fever on 11 to 12 May does not represent cases of SARS. None of the patients, which included 34 inpatients and 20 staff at the Institute, has shown any signs of clinical progression characteristic of SARS. Alternative diagnoses, including influenza and other causes of upper respiratory tract infection, have further excluded suspicion of SARS. Of the 54 patients, 25 have been discharged and only 7 continue to have mild febrile illness.\n\nAs a precautionary measure, the Ministry had previously decided to treat the cluster as suspect SARS cases until proven otherwise.\n\nIn line with this view, Singapore immediately introduced a series of stringent measures, including transfer of all cases to a designated hospital, active contact tracing, recall for medical consultation of all patients recently discharged from the Institute, and home quarantine for selected individuals. In addition, special accommodations for staff at the Institute, who continued to care for patients, were arranged to minimize opportunities for further transmission to occur pending results of the investigation.\n\nThe most recent probable SARS case in Singapore developed symptoms on 27 April and was isolated the following day.\n\nUpdate on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 7761 probable SARS cases with 623 deaths have been reported from 28 countries. This represents an increase of 33 cases and 12 deaths compared with yesterday. The new deaths occurred in China (7) and Hong Kong SAR (5).",

        "Description of the Situation": "16 May 2003\nDisease Outbreak Reported\nSituation in China, guidance for mass gatherings, stability of the SARS virus, more than 600 deaths globally\n\nSituation in China China has today reported 39 new probable SARS cases and 4 new deaths, bringing the cumulative total to 5191 probable cases and 275 deaths.\n\nBeijing reported 28 probable SARS cases today in the sixth consecutive day that the city has reported less than 50 probable SARS. From the last week of April through 3 May, Beijing was reporting a daily average of more than 100 probable cases. The daily number of new deaths has also declined from a peak of 15, reported on 22 April, to an average of 4 during the past week. Beijing reported a single death today.\n\nWHO experts interpret the decrease in case numbers as encouraging, but have cautioned against concluding that the city\u2019s SARS cases were on a downward trend. They warned that misdiagnosis of cases could have contributed to the lower numbers of probable cases in recent days. WHO officials fear that patients with milder symptoms of SARS are being excluded as probable cases.\n\nThe number of wrongly diagnosed patients is not known, but WHO experts became concerned that this could be happening after recent visits to Beijing hospitals.\n\n\u201cThey fit the case definition but because they get better in a few days, they are not seen as probable cases,\u201d explained Dr Daniel Chin, leader of WHO\u2019s Beijing team of SARS experts. \u201cClinicians are making this decision because there\u2019s an assumption that SARS patients must be very sick. But there\u2019s a spectrum of severity for SARS.\u201d\n\nClinicians were also basing their decision to exclude patients as probable SARS cases simply because they had not had any known previous contact with a SARS case \u2013 a definition used in areas with few SARS cases. Given the relatively large number of SARS cases in Beijing, such a criterion cannot be used, Dr Chin said.\n\nHe added that this was occurring due to confusion over the case definition, not because clinicians were trying to hide cases. WHO has asked the Beijing Government for a taskforce to be convened to address this issue.\n\nDr Chin said patients with milder SARS symptoms must be treated with all the same precautions. \u201cIt is still possible that they are not SARS cases, but without a reliable test, we can\u2019t confirm that,\u201d he said.\n\nPatients with milder symptoms start off being isolated as suspect cases. But after their condition improves, they end up being sent to general medical wards, where they could infect other patients. Others may be sent home too early. \u201cThey may not need to be hospitalized but they could still be infectious,\u201d Dr Chin said.\n\nA study of clinical progression in 75 SARS patients, published in today\u2019s Lancet by a Hong Kong laboratory in the WHO network, describes three clinical stages in patients from the Amoy Gardens cluster. In the mostly uniform three-stage pattern, the first week of illness was characterized by fever, myalgia, and other symptoms that generally improved after a few days. In the second week of illness, when infectivity is greatest, patients frequently experienced recurrence of fever, diarrhoea, and oxygen desaturation. In this study, 20% of the patients progressed to a third phase, characterized by acute respiratory distress syndrome necessitating ventilatory support.\n\nHealth authorities and clinicians need to be aware of these three phases of illness. In terms of preventing further spread, including nosocomial transmission, it is dangerous to prematurely relax precautions, notably isolation and infection control, following clinical improvement during the first week of illness.\n\nGuidance for mass gatherings Guidance for mass gatherings was issued by WHO yesterday in response to concern that persons travelling to large events from areas with local transmission of SARS might pose a risk to other attendees in the host country. The recommendations, which are issued as global guidance and based on a risk-benefit analysis, are in line with WHO efforts to prevent the further international spread of SARS while also protecting the travelling public from unjustified restrictions. See Guidance for Mass Gatherings: hosting persons arriving from an area with recent local transmission of SARS\n\nThe purpose of the recommendations is to help hosting governments and organizers of such events make decisions that protect domestic populations.\n\nSuch decisions are left to the authority of individual countries based on their own assessment of the nature of the event, the potential for exposure of the general population should a case of SARS occur, and the capacity of the country\u2019s public health infrastructure to cope. Capacity includes pre-existing arrangements for surveillance, contact tracing, and isolation \u2013 in other words, capacity for managing the situation should someone attending the event become ill with SARS.\n\nStability of the SARS virus in the environment WHO has today published additional data on the stability of the SARS virus on different environmental surfaces. See First data on stability and resistance of SARS coronavirus compiled by members of WHO laboratory network\n\nThe data, which come from studies conducted by laboratories in the WHO network, indicate that the SARS virus in sterilized stool can survive for 36 hours on a plastered wall or a formica surface, for 72 hours on a plastic surface or stainless steel, and for 96 hours on a glass slide.\n\nUpdate on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 7739 probable SARS cases and 611 deaths have been reported from 29 countries. This represents an increase of 54 new cases and 13 deaths compared with yesterday. The new deaths occurred in China (4), Hong Kong SAR (4), and Taiwan, China (5).",

        "Description of the Situation": "Outbreaks in the initial \u201chot zones\u201d indicate that SARS can be contained\n\n13 May 2003  Disease Outbreak Reported\n\nTo date, the WHO approach to SARS has been aimed at sealing off opportunities for further spread, both within countries reporting cases and internationally. Experiences in a growing number of countries indicate that the disease can be contained, thus supporting WHO\u2019s overall objective: to prevent SARS from becoming widely established as another new disease in humans.\n\nIn the absence of a vaccine, the most effective way to control a new disease such as SAS is to break the chain of transmission from infected to healthy persons. In almost all documented cases, SARS is spread through close face-to-face contact with infected droplets when a patient sneezes or coughs.\n\nFor SARS, three activities \u2013 case detection, patient isolation, and contact tracing \u2013 can reduce the number of people exposed to each infectious case and eventually break the chain of transmission.\n\nCase detection aims to identify SARS cases as soon after onset of illness as possible. Once cases are identified, the next step is to ensure their prompt isolation, in a properly equipped facility, and management according to strict procedures of infection control. The third activity \u2013 the detective work \u2013 involves the identification of all close contacts of each case and assurance of their careful follow-up, including daily health checks and possible voluntary home isolation.\n\nTogether, these activities limit the daily number of contacts possible for each potentially infectious case. They also work to shorten the amount of time that lapses between onset of illness and isolation of the patient, thus reducing opportunities for the virus to spread to others.\n\nThe effectiveness of these measures is reflected in an important indicator of disease transmission \u2013 the so-called \u201ceffective reproduction number\u201d. This is the average number of new cases generated by each new case.\n\nIf each new SARS patient infects more than one additional person, then the number of new cases will increase with time. If each new SARS patient infects one further person, then the number of new cases will remain static. However, if each new SARS patient infects, on average, less than one further person, then the number of new cases will fall and the outbreak will die out. This remains WHO\u2019s overall objective, both in its support to individual countries and globally.\n\nThe example of Singapore Singapore has instituted comprehensive procedures for contact tracing and isolation, and these measures appear to be working. WHO learned yesterday, during a videoconference with Singaporean officials, that the so-called \u201ctime to isolation\u201d had been reduced from a high of three days in the early phase of the outbreak to 1.4 days by last week, thus reducing by half the amount of time infected persons can expose others to the SARS virus.\n\nThese measures are being applied elsewhere, with SARS outbreaks coming under control in several areas. WHO is now collecting the data needed to systematically assess the effectiveness of these and other control measures being implemented around the world, and will strengthen its recommendations accordingly.\n\nNonetheless, as SARS has clearly demonstrated, a single case admitted to an unprepared hospital can ignite a new outbreak. While trends are moving in an encouraging direction in many areas, even greater focus on control measures is needed if SARS is to be contained globally. WHO experiences with outbreaks of Ebola haemorrhagic fever have repeatedly shown that the initial stages of containment are the most dangerous time to start lowering the level of control.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t become complacent,\u201d says Michael J. Ryan, Coordinator of WHO\u2019s Global Alert and Response Programme. \u201cIn fact, this is the time to intensify our efforts.\u201d\n\nDr Ryan has led international field responses to large outbreaks of Ebola and several other emerging infectious diseases.\n\nUpdate on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 7548 probable SARS cases with 573 deaths has been reported from 29 countries. This represents an increase of 111 new cases and 21 deaths compared with yesterday. The new deaths occurred in China (10), Hong Kong SAR (7), and Taiwan, China (4).\n\nChina has reported today 80 new probable cases and 10 deaths, bringing the cumulative totals to 5086 probable cases and 262 deaths. New cases were concentrated in Beijing (48), Hebei (14), and Shanxi (13).\n\nTaiwan reported 23 new cases and 4 deaths, bringing the cumulative totals to 207 cases and 24 deaths",

        "Description of the Situation": "Situation in Singapore and Hong Kong, interpretation of \u201careas with recent local transmission\u201d\n\n12 May 2003\n Disease Outbreak Reported\n\nSituation in Singapore A panel of WHO experts conferred by videoconference today with Singaporean officials, led by Minister for Health and Second Minister for Finance Lim Hng Kiang and Minister of State for Health Dr Balaji Sadasivan, to assess progress in containing the SARS outbreak.\n\nSingapore has greatly increased its containment measures aimed at halting further transmission of SARS. A special effort has been made to raise the standards of infection control at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, which was converted into the country\u2019s specialized hospital for managing SARS patients.\n\nSingapore has also introduced strict screening measures for all outbound air passengers. Selected incoming passengers from areas with recent local transmission of SARS are also screened. Nineteen thermal infrared scanners are in place at the airport, on loan from the military. The machines are capable of detecting a fever within a 0.2\u00b0C degree range of accuracy.\n\nNext week, 7 more scanners are expected to be added, ensuring that all inbound and outbound passengers can be checked. Last week, of the 70,000 passengers that were screened, 58 were found to have fever and taken to the SARS-designated hospital. Two were later admitted as suspect SARS cases, but neither has been reclassified as probable. All contacts of known SARS cases are being placed under supervised home quarantine for 10 days.\n\nSingapore\u2019s actions to contain the SARS outbreak were described as \u201cexemplary\u201d by Dr David Heymann, Executive Director of communicable disease programmes at WHO. \u201cSingapore has been one of the most successful countries in its response to SARS,\u201d said Dr Heymann.\n\nSituation in Hong Kong Hong Kong today reported 5 new probable cases of SARS. The territory has seen a steady decline in the number of new cases, which has been in the single digits for the past eight days. WHO experts also held a videoconference with Hong Kong\u2019s Secretary of Health, Welfare and Food, Dr Eng-kiong Yeoh and Director of Health Dr Margaret Chan today. WHO commended Hong Kong officials for their level of transparency in reporting on the SARS situation in the territory, a degree of cooperation that would be valuable from all countries.\n\nHong Kong has introduced a rigorous contact tracing procedure. All close contacts of known SARS cases are quarantined at home. In addition, their Hong Kong Identity Card numbers are passed to the Immigration Department to ensure that these individuals cannot leave the territory.\n\nContact tracing has established epidemiological links for the majority of Hong Kong\u2019s SARS patients. Around 8.6% of patients have no identifiable exposure source. Detailed investigation is ongoing.\n\nThe last known exportation of a SARS case from Hong Kong occurred on 18 April.\n\nInterpretation of \u201careas with recent local transmission\u201d The list of areas with recent local transmission is issued by WHO to facilitate use of the SARS case definition to detect and report suspect and probable cases. A recent history of travel to an area where local transmission outside a confined setting, such as the health care environment, has been documented can assist physicians in the interpretation of symptoms in international travellers.\n\nInclusion of countries and areas in this list, which is stratified, does not mean that WHO recommends travel restrictions to the country or area.\n\nBeginning today, WHO is posting on its website a new table indicating those areas with recent local transmission for which WHO has issued recommendations pertaining to international travel. Two recommended measures are specified: exit screening for international travellers departing the area, and traveller to consider postponing all but essential travel to the area. The table will be updated daily.\n\nNo travel restrictions are recommended by WHO to any other areas.\n\nThe previous list of \u201careas with recent local transmission\u201d continues to be issued daily, but is now linked to the SARS case definitions. This change is introduced to reduce opportunities for misinterpretation of the purpose and significance of the list.\n\nUpdate on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 7447 probable cases with 552 deaths have been reported from 30 countries. This represents an increase of 168 new cases and 26 deaths since the last update was issued on Saturday. The new deaths were reported in China (17), Hong Kong SAR (6), Taiwan, China (2), and Singapore (1).\n\nChina has today reported 144 new probable cases, bringing the cumulative total to 5013 cases, with 252 deaths. Most new cases were reported in Beijing (48) and Hebei (11).\n\nTaiwan reported 12 new cases, bringing the cumulative total to 184 cases, with 20 deaths.",

        "Description of the Situation": "Situation in China, the Philippines, and Mongolia\n\n10 May 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported \n\nSituation in China China has reported 85 new probable cases of SARS today, including 54 new cases in Beijing, and 5 new deaths. China now has a cumulative total of 4884 probable cases, with 235 deaths.\n\nBeijing remains the most severely affected area in mainland China, with a cumulative total of 2227 probable cases and 116 deaths. Since the beginning of this month, Beijing has reported 862 new probable cases and 41 deaths. The largest number of cases for this month occurred on 1 May, when Beijing reported 122 new cases and 7 deaths.\n\nAlthough today\u2019s figures are lower, WHO officials in Beijing have cautioned against any clear conclusions that the SARS outbreak has begun to decline in the city. Many factors that influence the outbreak\u2019s future evolution remain unknown. For example, half of all new probable cases in the city do not have any recorded previous contact with a SARS patient. Knowledge about the source of transmission for all SARS cases contributes to understanding of the dynamics of the outbreak and assists in its containment.\n\nWHO officials will be working with Beijing authorities to improve data analysis and develop policy options for responding to the outbreak. The lack of known contact to a SARS patient among the more recently reported cases could be related to either how cases are being reported or how and where the virus is being transmitted.\n\nSituation in the Philippines As of 10 May, the Philippines has reported a cumulative total of 10 probable SARS cases, with two deaths. Health authorities have determined that all 10 cases are part of a chain of transmission linked to a single imported case. All cases were placed in isolation in hospital.\n\nContacts of the 10 cases have been traced, and authorities are confident that all contacts have been identified and placed in isolation. The last two cases that could have transmitted infection were isolated on 30 April. All contacts have completed their period of observation and none has developed SARS.\n\nThe cluster of SARS cases in the Philippines began with the importation of a case who returned to the Philippines from Toronto, Canada. The imported case subsequently died from SARS, as did her father. Two of the remaining eight patients have been discharged. The others are recovering in hospital.\n\nWHO considers that the cluster of SARS cases has been well contained. There appears to be no increased transmission risk in the Philippines. For these reasons, WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel to the Philippines.\n\nSituation in Mongolia Yesterday Mongolia was removed from the list of countries with recent local transmission. Twenty days had passed since the only case resulting from local transmission was appropriately isolated.\n\nEarlier, WHO sent specialists to the country to investigate the cluster of cases and provide technical support. Isolation facilities were judged adequate and contact tracing was considered complete. WHO has therefore concluded that the cluster of cases in Mongolia has been well contained.\n\nThe cumulative total of probable SARS cases in Mongolia is nine. No deaths have occurred. Six of the nine cases have recovered. The additional three cases remain in isolation in a SARS-designated hospital.\n\nWHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel to Mongolia.\n\nUpdate on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 7296 probable SARS cases with 526 deaths have been reported from 30 countries. This represents an increase of 119 cases and 12 deaths when compared with yesterday.\n\nMost of the new cases were reported in China (85) and Taiwan, China (23). The new deaths occurred in China (8), Hong Kong SAR (2), and Taiwan, China (5).",

He will be meeting with Vice Premier Wu Yi and other officials in the ministries of health and foreign affairs. The purpose of the visit is to exchange views on the SARS situation and other health issues in China.\n\nDr Lee, who was nominated in January for the post of WHO Director-General, currently directs the WHO\u2019s Stop TB initiative. He has worked at WHO for 19 years in technical, managerial and policy positions. Prior to heading the TB initiative, he led the WHO effort to reduce childhood deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases.\n\nDuring his tenure in WHO\u2019s Western Pacific Regional Office, Dr Lee visited China many times, particularly in conjunction with the region\u2019s successful effort to eradicate poliomyelitis.\n\nIf confirmed by the World Health Assembly, which convenes later this month, Dr Lee will succeed Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland and begin his five-year term in July 2003.\n\nChina has today reported 118 new probable SARS cases and 6 new deaths, bringing the cumulative totals to 4805 probable cases and 230 deaths.\n\nToday, Being reported 48 new cases and 2 new deaths, Inner Mongolia reported 20 new cases and 1 new death, Shanxi reported 11 new cases, and Hebei reported 9 new cases and 2 deaths. The additional death was reported in Tianjin.\n\nYesterday, a WHO team travelled to Hebei Province, which borders Beijing municipality, to assess the SARS situation. The WHO investigation is being conducted in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and marks the first time that a joint WHO-Ministry of Health team has been sent to a province. WHO has expressed concern that Hebei could be particularly vulnerable to the spread of SARS, as the province has a large population of migrant workers \u2013 part of Beijing\u2019s \u201cfloating population\u201d.\n\nThe investigation in Hebei has two objectives: to review the surveillance and case reporting systems, and to visit hospitals to asses procedures for patient management and infection control. In several outbreaks elsewhere, lapses in infection control have resulted in the infection of large number of hospital staff.\n\nMore than 7000 cases and 500 deaths reported globally As of today, a cumulative total of 7183 probable cases of SARS and 514 deaths have been reported from 30 countries on six continents. This represents an increase of 144 new cases and 8 deaths when compared with yesterday. Of the new deaths, 6 were reported in China, and 2 were reported in Hong Kong SAR.\n\nIn the past week, more than 1000 new probable cases and 96 deaths were reported globally.",

        "Description of the Situation": "7 May 2003\n\nDisease Outbreak Reported\nSARS case fatality ratio, incubation period\n\nCase fatality ratio WHO has today revised its initial estimates of the case fatality ratio of SARS. The revision is based on an analysis of the latest data from Canada, China, Hong Kong SAR, Singapore, and Viet Nam.\n\nOn the basis of more detailed and complete data, and more reliable methods, WHO now estimates that the case fatality ratio of SARS ranges from 0% to 50% depending on the age group affected, with an overall estimate of case fatality of 14% to 15%.\n\nThe likelihood of dying from SARS in a given area has been shown to depend on the profile of the cases, including the age group most affected and the presence of underlying disease. Based on data received by WHO to date, the case fatality ratio is estimated to be less than 1% in persons aged 24 years or younger, 6% in persons aged 25 to 44 years, 15% in persons aged 45 to 64 years, and greater than 50% in persons aged 65 years and older.\n\nA case fatality ratio measures the proportion of all people with a disease who will die from the disease. In other words, it measures the likelihood that a disease will kill its host, and is thus an important indicator of the severity of a disease and its significance as a public health problem. The likelihood that a person will die of SARS could be influenced by factors related to the SARS virus, the route of exposure and dose (amount) of virus, personal factors such as age or the presence of another disease, and access to prompt medical care.\n\nMany factors complicate efforts to calculate a case fatality ratio while an outbreak is still evolving. Deaths from SARS typically occur after several weeks of illness. Full recovery may take even longer. While an epidemic is still evolving, only some of the individuals affected by the disease will have died or recovered. Only at the end of an epidemic can an absolute value be calculated, taking into account total deaths, total recoveries and people lost to follow-up. Calculating case fatality as the number of deaths reported divided by the number of cases reported irrespective of the time elapsed since they became ill gives an underestimate of the true case fatality ratio.\n\nOne method of overcoming this difficulty is to calculate the case fatality ratio using only those cases whose final outcome \u2013 died or recovered \u2013 is known. However, this method, when applied before an outbreak is over, gives an overestimate because the average time from illness onset to death for SARS is shorter than the average time from illness onset to recovery.\n\nWith these methods, estimates of the case fatality ratio range from 11% to 17% in Hong Kong, from 13% to 15% in Singapore, from 15% to 19% in Canada, and from 5% to 13% in China.\n\nA more accurate and unbiased estimation of case fatality for SARS can be obtained with a third method, survival analysis. This method relies on detailed individual data on the time from illness onset to death or full recovery, or time since illness onset for current cases. Using this method, WHO estimates that the case fatality ratio is 14% in Singapore and 15% in Hong Kong.\n\nIn Viet Nam, where SARS has been contained and measurement is more straightforward, case fatality was comparatively low, at 8%. One explanation for this is the large number of total cases that occurred in younger, previously healthy health care workers.\n\nIncubation period WHO has also reviewed estimates of the incubation period of SARS, using individual case data. On the basis of this review, WHO continues to conclude that the current best estimate of the maximum incubation period is 10 days.\n\nThe incubation period, which is the time from exposure to a causative agent to onset of disease, is particularly important as it forms the basis for many recommended control measures, including contact tracing and the duration of home isolation for contacts of probable SARS cases. Knowledge about the incubation period can also help physicians make diagnostic decisions about whether the presenting symptoms and clinical history of a patient point to SARS or to some other disease.\n\nThe incubation period can vary from one case to another according to the route by which the person was exposed, the dose of virus received, and other factors, including immune status. Estimates of the incubation period are further complicated by the fact that some patients have had opportunities for multiple exposures to the virus. The particular exposure that caused disease may prove impossible to determine. For these reasons, the most reliable estimates of the incubation period are based on a study of cases having a single documented exposure to a known case.\n\nIn today\u2019s review, WHO has analysed the incubation periods of individuals with well-defined single-point exposures in Singapore, Canada, and Europe. Findings support the original estimate of 10 days as the maximum incubation period.\n\nHowever, one recently published analysis of data from Hong Kong estimates a longer maximum incubation period in a group of 57 patients. This analysis, which may be significant and important for disease control, will be studied in more detail. The longer incubation period could reflect differences in methodology, specificity of diagnosis, route of transmission, infectious dose, or other factors. Reliable diagnosis \u2013 determining that all cases diagnosed as SARS are true cases of the disease \u2013 has been particularly difficult to establish in this outbreak, as diagnosis is made based on a set of non-specific symptoms and clinical signs that are seen in several other diseases.\n\nPrompt isolation WHO continues to recommend the earliest possible isolation of all suspect and probable cases of SARS. A short time between onset of symptoms and isolation reduces opportunities for transmission to others. It also reduces the number of contacts requiring active follow-up, and thus helps relieve some of the burden on health services. In addition, prompt hospitalization gives patients the best chance of receiving possibly life-saving care should their condition take a critical course.\n\nUpdate on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 6903 probable SARS cases and 495 deaths has been reported from 29 countries. This represents an increase of 186 new cases and 17 deaths compared with yesterday. The new deaths occurred in China (5), Hong Kong SAR (11) and Taiwan (1).",

        "Description of the Situation": "6 May 2003 \nDisease Outbreak Reported A panel of WHO staff participated in a video teleconference with Hong Kong government officials earlier today to discuss the SARS situation in Hong Kong. Present at the meeting from Hong Kong were the Secretary for Health, Welfare and Food, Dr. Eng-kiong Yeoh, Director of Health, Dr. Margaret Chan, and the Health, Welfare and Food Bureau\u2019s Head of Research, Dr. Lo Su Vui. WHO staff included Dr David Heymann, Executive Director for Communicable Diseases, and a panel with expertise in virology, epidemiology, and clinical medicine.\n\nFollowing a presentation by Dr Yeoh, Dr Heymann characterized the efforts taken in Hong Kong to stem the spread of SARS as \u201cheroic.\u201d \u201cAll of us have nothing but admiration for you and your team,\u201d he added.\n\nParticularly impressive among the measures, which is some cases exceed those recommended by WHO, are exit screening procedures at border checkpoints, publication of information on all buildings where residents have developed SARS, procedures for isolation and quarantine, and aggressive contract tracing that relies on a system initially developed by the police force for use in criminal investigations.\n\nHong Kong reported 9 new SARS cases today, including 2 health care workers and 7 contacts of patients known to have had SARS. To date, Hong Kong has reported a cumulative total of 1646 probable cases and 193 deaths.\n\nThe number of new cases (in the single digits for the last several days) has steadily declined, suggesting that the outbreak has peaked. Epidemiological data submitted to WHO today indicate three apparent peaks of SARS in Hong Kong: the Prince of Wales Hospital outbreak (18 March), the Amoy Gardens outbreak (30 March), and a smaller outbreak in the outlying region of Tai Po (11 April).\n\nSince 29 March, Hong Kong has introduced medical posts, supported by infrared temperature scanners, at its border points. All incoming travellers are now required to sign health declarations. As of 14 April, the government has prohibited close contacts of SARS patients from leaving Hong Kong, by monitoring residents via their Hong Kong Identity Card numbers. As a result of these routine checks, 37 people have been referred to health authorities. Of these, two were later confirmed to be SARS cases.\n\nHong Kong is also employing a strategic computer system to facilitate contact tracing and to identify addresses and names of close contacts of SARS patients. Geographic clusters of SARS cases, or so-called \u201chot spots\u201d in certain buildings throughout the territory have been identified using this scheme. The government maintains data on cases and their contacts in a centralized, dedicated eSARS database.\n\nDr Yeoh also announced today that no new cases associated with the Amoy Gardens outbreak have occurred for 20 days. Hong Kong has recently launched several public information and education campaigns to increase SARS awareness. These efforts have been successful in encouraging people experiencing symptoms to seek prompt medical care, thus reducing the time when people capable of spreading the virus are circulating in the community.\n\nChina China reported 138 new probable SARS cases today, 70 of which were from Beijing, bringing the cumulative total in the country and capital to 4409 and 1960 respectively. There were also 8 deaths reported, half from Beijing, bringing the total number of SARS deaths to 214.\n\nNew probable SARS cases were also reported in Guangdong (12), Hebei (6), Inner Mongolia (21), Jilin (2) and Tianjin (11). The number of cases in Jilin has increased in the last few days, with cases tripling tos 23 since April 30. There were also two new cases in Shanghai, bringing the city\u2019s total number of cases to six.\n\nCases continued to rise in the two most heavily affected provinces outside of the capital, Shanxi and Inner Mongolia, with 11 and 21 probable cases reported, for a total of 369 and 251 respectively.\n\nWHO experts will visit Hebei province in China as part of a joint Ministry of Health-WHO team to assess the SARS situation and the capacity to cope with an outbreak.\n\nFour WHO experts will leave on 8 May with experts from China\u2019s Ministry of Health for the province, which surrounds Beijing and is home to some of the capital\u2019s \u201cfloating population\u201d of migrant workers.\n\nThe number of probable SARS cases in Hebei has risen sharply in the last few days to a total of 113, as of today. In just five days between April 30 and May 4, the numbers doubled to 98. There are also about 100 suspect SARS cases in the province.\n\n\u201cWe feel the team can make a difference here. It\u2019s still early on in the epidemic. Our input at this stage could prevent the situation developing into a large outbreak. The level of development in the province is also above average, so any recommendations made can be quickly implemented, although resources will still be stretched,\u201d said Alan Schnur, from WHO\u2019s China office who will join the team.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of movement between the province and the capital so we are concerned about the potential for the disease to spread,\u201d he added.\n\nUpdate on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 6727 probable SARS cases with 478 deaths have been reported from 29 countries. This represents an increase of 153 new cases and 17 new deaths compared with yesterday.\n\nColombia reported its first probable case today. India also reported a probable case today.",

        "Description of the Situation": "Studies of SARS virus survival, situation in China \n\n5 May 2003 \nDisease Outbreak Reported \n\nScientists in the WHO network of collaborating laboratories yesterday reported results of the first scientific studies designed to determine the survival time of the SARS virus in different environmental media. Results from studies of the effectiveness of different disinfectants commonly used in hospitals were also reported, confirming the validity of currently recommended measures for infection control.\n\nThe new studies, conducted at network labs in Hong Kong, Japan, and Germany confirm, as anticipated, that the SARS virus can survive after drying on plastic surfaces for up to 48 hours. Ongoing studies are testing virus stability on additional surfaces, with initial results expected by Wednesday.\n\nScientists have also tested virus survival times in faeces. Research conducted at one Hong Kong lab determined that the virus can survive in faeces for at least 2 days, and in urine for at least 24 hours. Studies conducted at a second Hong Kong lab found that virus in faeces taken from patients suffering from diarrhoea, which has a lower acidity than normal stools, could survive for 4 days. This raises the possibility that surfaces contaminated with faeces from patients suffering from diarrhoea might survive for as long as 4 days. However, the dose of virus needed to cause infection remains unknown. Further studies are needed before firm conclusions about the role of faecal-oral transmission can be made.\n\nResults of the new studies underscore the need for frequent handwashing, proper cleaning, and good disinfection control in hospitals managing SARS cases. Spread by infected droplets remains the most important mode of transmission. Good personal hygiene, including frequent handwashing, is important for everyone in areas with SARS cases, but most especially so for persons who have been in close contact with a probable case.\n\nShedding of the SARS virus in faeces, respiratory secretions, and urine is now well-established. In Hong Kong in late March, a large and sudden cluster of more than 320 simultaneous cases occurred among residents of the Amoy Gardens housing estate. The outbreak raised the possibility of an environmental source of infection. Subsequent investigations suggested that contamination with sewage might have played a role. Around 66% of Amoy Gardens SARS patients presented with diarrhoea as a symptom, compared with 2% to 7% of cases in other outbreaks. With the exception of the Amoy Gardens cluster and a previous event where cases were linked to visits to a single floor of a hotel, SARS is thought to spread in the majority of cases through close person-to-person exposure to infected droplets expelled during coughing or sneezing.\n\nAll previous speculation about the environmental behaviour of the SARS virus was based on knowledge about other well-known human members of the Coronavirus family, which cause illnesses such as the common cold. WHO has been concerned that the SARS virus, which is unlike any other human or animal virus in its family, might behave differently. Studies now under way in the network laboratories will support the further development and implementation of virus-specific infection control measures. WHO remains concerned that the SARS virus continues to be transmitted to hospital staff in highly advanced settings where sophisticated infection control measures are in place.\n\nSituation in China Chinese authorities reported 160 new probable cases of SARS and 9 new deaths. The new figures bring the cumulative total in China to 4280 probable cases and 206 deaths. Of the new cases, 98 were reported in Beijing. The second highest number of new cases was reported in Shanxi. Three of the 9 deaths occurred in Beijing, 3 in Guangdong, 2 in Shanxi, and 1 in Tianjin.\n\nThe new figures bring the cumulative total in China to 4280 probable cases and 206 deaths. China now accounts for 65% of the world\u2019s total cumulative number of probable SARS cases and 44% of all reported deaths.\n\nIn Beijing, some 16,000 residents remain under quarantine. In Taiyuan, the capital of Shanxi Province, where 360 probable SARS cases have been reported, all schools are to be closed indefinitely.\n\nWHO officials are particularly concerned about the SARS situation in China\u2019s outer provinces, where surveillance and reporting systems may not be sufficiently sensitive to detect all suspect and probable cases. In resource-poor regions like Gansu and Jiangxi, serious questions remain about the capacity of the health systems to cope with a challenge on the scale of SARS.\n\nUpdate on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 6583 probable SARS cases with 461 deaths have been reported from 27 countries. This represents an increase of 364 new cases and 26 new deaths since the last report was compiled on Saturday.",

        "Description of the Situation": "WHO sends team to Taiwan, situation in China\n\n3 May 2003   Disease Outbreak Reported  WHO sends team to Taiwan The spread of SARS in Taiwan has accelerated considerably during the past week. Yesterday, Taiwan announced a cumulative total of 100 probable SARS cases, a number representing almost a tripling of cases over the past 10 days. Since the outbreak began, 8 deaths have occurred.\n\nA WHO team arrived today in Taipei to support health authorities in combating the SARS outbreak. The two-person team, with expertise in epidemiology and virology, will visit hospitals and consult with local health authorities. As the outbreak has affected a number of hospital staff, a principal focus with be on the possible need to strengthen infection control procedures. The WHO team will also advise Taiwan officials on how best to stop the spread of the virus on the island.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s Center for Disease Control reported the first two suspected SARS cases, in a couple, on 14 March. The man had a February travel history to Guangdong Province and Hong Kong SAR. On 26 March, a Taiwanese resident of Hong Kong\u2019s Amoy Gardens flew to Taiwan and took a train to Taichung to celebrate the traditional festival, Qing Ming. The man\u2019s brother became Taiwan\u2019s first SARS fatality, and a fellow passenger on the train also became a case. By 16 April, 27 probable cases had been detected in Taiwan. Investigation of cases determined that all either had a travel history to an affected area, or had been in close contact with patients.\n\nThe number of cases began increasingly steadily in the last weeks of April. Several staff at two hospitals have become infected. On 28 April, the Taiwanese government imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine on all incoming travellers from China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Macau and Toronto, Canada.\n\nSituation in China China reported 181 new probable SARS cases today, 114 of which were from Beijing, bringing the cumulative total in the country and capital to 3971 and 1741 respectively. There were also 9 deaths reported, five of which were from Beijing.\n\nNew probable SARS cases were also reported in Shanxi (18), Tianjin (18), Inner Mongolia (10), Hebei (9), Guangdong (11) and Ningxia (1). Ten of the new cases in Tianjin were among health care workers.\n\nNearly 20% of cases in Beijing have occurred among health care workers in hospitals. Among the 114 new probable cases reported today in Beijing, 20 were among health care workers. These figures underscore the importance of rigorous infection control in hospitals and the need to strengthen measures in place in Beijing.\n\nAs of this morning, 13,688 people in the capital were in quarantine. Among buildings quarantined are 27 SARS-designated hospitals, two building sites and three apartment buildings belonging to universities.\n\nUnder on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 6234 probable cases with 435 deaths have been reported from 27 countries. This represents an increase of 191 new cases and 18 deaths compared with yesterday. The new deaths occurred in China (9) and Hong Kong SAR (9).",

These numbers bring the cumulative total in China to 3799 and 1636 in the capital. Eleven deaths were reported, accounting for a cumulative total of 181 deaths.\n\nInner Mongolia reported a jump of 26 in probable SARS cases, for a total of 180 cases in that province. Other provinces reporting new cases include Hebei (14), Guangdong (9), Jilin (5) and Shanxi (4).\n\nA WHO field visit to one large hospital not officially designated as a SARS hospital demonstrated the urgent need to review strategies for infection control procedures. Current infection control practices in emergency rooms may need to be modified, since health care workers continue to be infected. Among front-line health workers, 15 new cases were reported in Beijing. There are now 300 infected health care workers. 9 more cases among health workers were also reported in Tianjin.\n\nWHO team members in Beijing continue working with officials from the city\u2019s municipal health authorities to analyze epidemiological trends, but much missing data remain to be collected, and reports from case investigations must still be completed. \u201cThe public needs to have more information on when and where infection is happening,\u201d said Dr Henk Bekedam, WHO\u2019s representative in China. \u201cWe don\u2019t know that right now.\u201d\n\nUpdate on cases and countries\nAs of today, a cumulative total of 6054 probable SARS cases with 417 deaths have been reported from 27 countries. This represents an increase of 207 new cases and 26 deaths when compared with yesterday. The new deaths were reported in Canada (2), China (11), Hong Kong SAR (8), and Taiwan (5).\n\nTaiwan, which has a rapidly evolving outbreak, reported today a cumulative total of 100 probable cases, with 11 new cases compared with yesterday. Eight SARS deaths have occurred in Taiwan. Canada reported 2 new probable cases today.\n\nAreas with recent local transmission\nAs of today, WHO is now issuing daily lists of countries having areas where local transmission has occurred within the past 20 days. Local transmission occurs when one or more probable cases of SARS most likely acquired their infection locally, regardless of the setting, as opposed to cases in which infection was acquired in another country. The new list, which replaces the previous list of affected areas, also stratifies the extent of local transmission into low, medium, and high categories.",

        "Description of the Situation": "1 May 2003  Disease Outbreak Reported\nSituation in China, revised case definition, support to national labs\n\nSituation in China The number of new SARS cases continues to increase steadily in China, particularly in Beijing. Today, China reported 187 new cases and 11 deaths, more than half of which were in the capital.\n\nWHO officials in China believe the development of a central database of operational SARS data would greatly aid in combating the disease. The next few months will prove crucial in the attempt to contain SARS worldwide, which now greatly depends on whether the disease can be controlled in China.\n\nWHO is studying how best to support hospitals in some of China\u2019s poorer western and northern provinces. Concern continues that hospitals in these resource-poor regions may not have the necessary facilities to properly isolate and treat SARS patients. More front-line hospital staff with expertise in dealing with infectious diseases may be required. Guidelines are also needed for China\u2019s national health care system on the kinds of infection control measures needed to prevent continuing transmission of the disease.\n\nShanghai is to enforce stricter SARS preventive measures, including the enforcement of 14-day quarantine periods for travelers arriving from affected areas. These measures are even stricter than those currently recommended by WHO. Traffic checkpoints have already been set up to screen people coming into the city, where they are given temperature checks and asked to fill out health declaration forms.\n\nWHO revises SARS case definition WHO has today updated its case definition for SARS to take into account the appropriate use of results from laboratory tests. Several diagnostic tests have been developed by various laboratories for the detection of the SARS virus and antibodies to the virus. However, all presently available tests have specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nFor this reason, WHO continues to advise clinicians that patients should not have their case definition category downgraded while awaiting results of laboratory testing or on the basis of negative results.\n\nWHO is concerned that inappropriate use of laboratory results can have a negative impact on patient management and selection of an appropriate level of infection control. Therefore, negative test results for the SARS virus cannot be used to exclude infection in either suspect or probable cases. In contrast, positive results of quality-assured laboratory testing can add to the efficacy of SARS case management, provided tests are properly conducted and interpreted.\n\nPositive virus results from lab tests demonstrate that the patient is excreting virus, or its genetic material, and thus might pose a risk of disease transmission to others. Consequently, suspect SARS cases with a positive lab result (virus isolation or PCR) should be classified and reported as probable cases.\n\nGuidance for quality assurance, particularly for PCR tests, has been posted at the WHO website. See Recommendations for laboratories testing by PCR for presence of SARS coronavirus -RNA \n\nWHO supports calibration of diagnostic tests WHO, supported by members of its laboratory network for SARS diagnosis and the Robert-Koch Institute, Germany, is making standardized reagents available to improve reliability and support the quality assurance of diagnostic tests for SARS. Virological standards are being made available to ministries of health in countries with SARS outbreaks immediately, with shipment scheduled to begin on Monday 5 May. Serological kits will be made available by 12 May.\n\nMinistries of health are invited to designate national laboratories and communicate their needs to WHO at sars [email\u00a0protected] or fax 0041 22 791 48 78.\n\nThe diagnostic standards will be made available to up to 3 laboratories in all countries. In China, however, the supply will be sufficient for all major laboratories in all provinces.\n\nWHO is now planning an external proficiency testing programme to assess the performance of diagnostic tests and establish the basis for quality control.\n\nUpdate on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 5865 probable cases with 391 deaths have been reported from 27 countries. This represents an increase of 212 additional cases and 19 deaths when compared with yesterday. The deaths occurred in China (11), Hong Kong (5), Taiwan (2), and Singapore (1). Poland reported its first case today.\n\nThe United Kingdom and the United States of America have been removed from the list of areas with recent local transmission. In both countries, the last instance of local transmission occurred more than 20 days ago. Tianjin, China and Ulaanbaatar City, Mongolia, were added to the list.",

        "Description of the Situation": "Situation in China: more cases than the rest of the world combined\n\n30 April 2003\nDisease Outbreak Reported\n\n\nSituation in China China reported an additional 166 probable SARS cases with 11 deaths, bringing the cumulative total to 3460 cases and 159 deaths. China now accounts for more probable cases than the rest of the world combined.\n\nBeijing reported the highest number of new cases (101) and deaths (9), for a cumulative total of 1440 probable cases and 75 deaths. Of these new cases, 31 were previously reported as suspect cases while 70 were reported for the first time.\n\nNine hospitals in the Chinese capital now deal exclusively with SARS patients. Just outside Beijing, a 1000-bed complex has been built to accommodate incoming patients. Health authorities have expressed concern that the SARS outbreak could overwhelm Beijing\u2019s already crowded hospitals.\n\nXiong Ke Chest Hospital will open a new wing with 100 more beds for SARS patients tomorrow, hospital officials told a WHO expert during a visit to the hospital today. With 235 beds all occupied by SARS patients, the hospital already has the largest number of SARS patients in the country.\n\nDr James Maguire, from the WHO team of experts, said that despite extremely difficult working conditions, hospital staff had risen to the occasion. \u201cTheir esprit de corps is excellent. They are taking great pride in what they are doing and working very hard,\u201d he said, adding that some staff work 45 days without seeing their families. The rigorous infection control procedures included heavy and hot protective clothing.\n\nDr Maguire, an epidemiologist with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, said there was a need for more specialized equipment such as masks, gloves, ventilatory equipment, layer protective gear, and ambulances to transport patients between hospitals. WHO staff are aware that other hospitals in the city may need more or better supplies.\n\nThe disease continued to make its mark elsewhere in the country. Jiangsu Province, which borders Shanghai, reported its first case today. More cases were reported in western China, with 34 more probable cases from Shanxi and seven more from Inner Mongolia, giving a total of 299 and 127 probable cases respectively. One fifth of the cases (65) in Shanxi Province are among health workers.\n\nHebei also continued to report more cases, with nine more probable cases, giving a total of 48. Tianjin reported five more probable cases for a total of 49 cases, while Guangdong reported six, for a total of 1405.\n\nUpdate on countries and cases As of today, a cumulative total of 5663 probable cases with 372 deaths have been reported from 26 countries. This represents an increase of 211 new cases and 19 deaths when compared with yesterday. The new deaths were reported in China (11), Hong Kong SAR (7), and China, Taiwan (1). This was the first death in Taiwan, where the number of probable SARS cases has more than doubled, from 37 to 78, over the past week. China, Macao SAR reported its first probable case today.",

        "Description of the Situation": "29 April 2003\n\nDisease Outbreak Reported \nTravel advice for Toronto, situation in China\n\nWHO lifts travel advice for Toronto, effective tomorrow WHO Director-General Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland announced this evening that the travel advisory for Toronto will be lifted, effective tomorrow.\n\nTravel advisories for Beijing, Hong Kong SAR, and Guangdong and Shanxi provinces, China, remain in effect.\n\nTravel advisories are issued following consideration of several factors, including the magnitude of probable SARS cases, the last dates of cases of community transmission, and the last dates of export of cases.\n\nDr Brundtland cited three changes in Toronto over the last week. The magnitude of probable SARS cases has decreased. Twenty days have passed since the last cases of community transmission occurred. No new confirmed exportation of cases has occurred.\n\nWHO has also been assured by Canadian authorities that pro-active screening measures at airports will be implemented, as recommended by WHO.\n\nThere is no change in Toronto\u2019s status as an \u201caffected area.\u201d Viet Nam, which is the first country to have contained its SARS outbreak, was removed from the list of affected areas yesterday.\n\nSARS is the first major new infectious disease of the 21st century and is taking full advantage of the opportunities for rapid international spread afforded by a closely interconnected and highly mobile society. The purpose of travel advisories is to reduce opportunities for further international spread of what is a new, severe, and poorly understood infectious disease.\n\nTravel advisories are reviewed daily. Advice is issued on the basis of a set of epidemiological criteria. The risk to international public health, which is the principal concern for WHO, occurs when the magnitude and dynamics of an outbreak allow an infected person to slip past control measures and undertake international travel, possibly seeding an outbreak elsewhere.\n\nSituation in China A total of 202 new probable SARS cases were reported across China today, bringing the total number of cases in the country to 3303. Nine deaths were also reported today.\n\nProbable SARS cases have now been reported from 21 of China\u2019s 31 provinces. An additional four provinces have reported suspected cases.\n\nBeijing continues to report a high number of SARS cases, with 152 new probable cases and 9 deaths reported today. China\u2019s capital city now has a cumulative total of 1347 probable cases and 59 deaths.\n\nChina\u2019s largest number of cumulative cases remains concentrated in Guangdong Province, where the SARS outbreak began in mid-November. Only 10% of these cases are current. As 1201 patients have been discharged and 51 have died, there are less than 150 SARS cases remaining in Guangdong\u2019s health care system.\n\nIn contrast, the rapidly growing number of new cases in Beijing imposes a heavy burden on the health care system and particularly its hospital capacity. In Beijing, 86% of cases (1198 cases) are current.\n\nThe situation in western China continues to be of concern. New probable cases in Shanxi (23) and Inner Mongolia (7) increase the cumulative totals to 266 and 120 respectively.\n\nWHO is working with local health authorities in Beijing to review and improve the data needed to better monitor the SARS situation and assess the success of current control strategies. The WHO team of experts also visited hospitals which will soon be opened as SARS referral hospitals to assess their level of preparedness.\n\nUpdate on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 5462 probable cases with 353 deaths have been reported from 27 countries. This represents an increase of 226 new cases and 24 deaths when compared with yesterday.\n\nOf the 226 new cases, 202 were reported today from China, of which 152 occurred in Beijing. Due to difficulties of information technology, figures received from Chinese authorities yesterday were not included in yesterday\u2019s cumulative update.\n\nThe 24 deaths occurred in Canada (2), China (9), Hong Kong SAR (12), and Singapore (1).",

        "Description of the Situation": "28 April 2003\n\nDisease Outbreak Reported \nViet Nam removed from list of affected countries, more than 5000 probable cases worldwide\n\nViet Nam contains SARS WHO has today removed Viet Nam from the list of affected areas, making it the first country to successfully contain its SARS outbreak. The change in Viet Nam\u2019s status follows 20 consecutive days (the duration of two incubation periods) since the last new case was detected. \u201cIt\u2019s a big day for all of us in Viet Nam and also throughout the world,\u201d said Pascale Brudon, the WHO representative in Hanoi. \u201cWHO congratulates Viet Nam for being the first country to succeed in containing the SARS epidemic.\u201d\n\nThe Vietnamese government first made the announcement this morning, but added that the country needs to remain vigilant. The health ministry affirmed its determination to work with WHO to guard against the importation of the virus.\n\nSince SARS was first detected in Viet Nam on 26 February, WHO has collaborated closely with Vietnamese officials to bring the outbreak under control. Key actions have included early recognition of the outbreak, the consolidation of SARS patients in a single hospital, strict infection control, diligent contact tracing, and thorough investigation of all rumoured cases. \u201cWe have been capable of containing this epidemic, but the virus is still present in neighbouring countries,\u201d said Brudon.\n\nWHO believes Viet Nam should still maintain a high level of alert since even a single new case of SARS could spark another outbreak. Last week, the Vietnamese health ministry asked the Prime Minister to authorize the closing of the country\u2019s land borders with China. Viet Nam has currently heightened its border surveillance with China, but has stopped short of closing the border.\n\nMore than 5000 cases worldwide As of today, a cumulative total of 5050 probable SARS cases with 321 deaths have been reported from 26 countries. This represents an increase of 214 cases and 28 deaths when compared with the last report, issued on Saturday. The new deaths were reported from China (9), Hong Kong SAR (17), and Singapore (2).",

        "Description of the Situation": "26 April 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported\nSituation in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Viet Nam\n\nPreliminary findings of the WHO Shanghai team A WHO team of six experts, in Shanghai since Monday, has provided a preliminary report of its findings. The team was invited by Shanghai authorities to assess the SARS situation in China\u2019s second largest city.\n\nAmong its activities, the team examined the SARS surveillance and reporting system, investigated rumours that the case burden might be higher than officially reported, and visited 10 health facilities, 3 district Centres for Disease Control, and the municipal Centre for Disease Control. The team was given free access to all requested data, patient registries, and facilities, which were visited on very short notice.\n\nThe team found no evidence of systematic underreporting of cases, and concluded that the level of preparedness and response was good. Reporting of cases appeared to be open, frank, and accurate. Over the past 3\u20134 weeks, authorities designated two hospitals as dedicated to the treatment of SARS patients and set up cough and fever clinics. The team also found a very high level of government commitment to tackle the SARS problem.\n\nMany questions remain about why Shanghai has been spared a SARS outbreak on the scale of that seen in Beijing. Had a larger number of cases occurred, it is not certain whether the systems presently in place would have been able to cope.\n\nSituation in Hong Kong Health authorities announced 17 new cases, including 3 in health care workers, and 6 deaths, including the youngest SARS fatality in Hong Kong to date. This was a previously healthy 28-year-old man from the Amoy Gardens housing estate cluster. The other deaths occurred in men aged 38, 40, 61, and 70 years, and a 45-year-old woman. Only one of these patients, the 70-year-old man, had a history of chronic disease.\n\nOf the six deaths announced yesterday, three were from the Amoy Gardens cluster.\n\nAuthorities are continuing to investigate a small cluster of cases in the Tung Tau housing estate, where six cases have occurred in vertically linked flats. Presently available epidemiological evidence gives no reason to anticipate an outbreak at the estate on the scale of Amoy Gardens cluster, which involved more than 320 residents of a single building.\n\nA WHO team of environmental and \u201csick building\u201d experts arrived in Hong Kong to assist local experts in the investigation of possible environmental sources of the virus.\n\nNo new cases in Viet Nam for 18 days The SARS situation in Viet Nam has remained stable, at 63 cases and 5 deaths, for 18 consecutive days. Active investigation of numerous rumours has failed to detect a new case of SARS throughout this period. If the trend continues, the country will be removed from the list of affected areas on Monday, making Viet Nam the first country to contain its SARS outbreak.\n\nWHO officials in Viet Nam cautioned against a lapse in the present high state of alert, as the risk persists that a single imported case could seed an outbreak, as happened in February. However, the government showed strong commitment at the highest level from the beginning of the outbreak. Task forces and provincial teams were established and have worked well. Good procedures of infection control were rapidly established and eventually proved effective in preventing further spread among hospital staff.\n\nShould the country experience an imported case, this newly established infrastructure would most likely be effective in preventing another large outbreak.\n\nUpdate on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 4836 cases with 293 deaths have occurred in 26 countries. This represents an increase of 190 new cases and 19 deaths compared with yesterday. The new deaths occurred in Canada (3), China (7), Hong Kong SAR (6), the Philippines (1), and Singapore (2).",

        "Description of the Situation": "25 April 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported\nOptimism in Viet Nam, caution urged when using diagnostic tests\n\nViet Nam may soon become the first country to contain SARS No new cases of SARS have been detected in Viet Nam for 17 days in a row, despite a high level of awareness and good surveillance. Although numerous rumours have been reported, all have been investigated by WHO and government officials, and all suspect cases have been determined to have other causes.\n\nThe most recent probable case was detected on 8 April, bringing the cumulative total in Viet Nam to 63 cases. Detection of that case initially brought disappointment, as it occurred after no new cases had been reported over an 8-day period. Since the outbreak was first recognized in Hanoi in late February, 5 deaths have occurred. As of today, five patients remain hospitalized.\n\nViet Nam was the second country to experience a SARS outbreak. The first was China, where an outbreak began in Guangdong Province in mid-November of last year.\n\nIf no new cases are detected by 30 April (a date which marks the end of two incubation periods), Viet Nam could become the first country to be taken off the list of SARS-affected countries. This achievement would also make Viet Nam the first country to successfully contain its SARS outbreak.\n\nSARS was first identified by Dr Carlo Urbani, a WHO infectious disease specialist. Dr Urbani alerted the world to SARS when cases of an unusual and severe respiratory disease began appearing among health staff treating a Chinese-American businessman at the French Hospital in Hanoi. The patient, a 48-year-old resident of Hong Kong, was admitted to hospital on 26 February with fever and respiratory symptoms. His recent travel history included trips to Guangdong Province, Shanghai, and Macao SAR. By 20 March, at least 22 staff at the Hanoi hospital were ill with influenza-like symptoms. Twenty had signs of pneumonia, and two were in serious condition.\n\nThe Chinese-American businessman died of SARS in Hong Kong on 13 March. Dr Urbani died of SARS in Thailand on 29 March.\n\nWHO country staff attribute Viet Nam\u2019s success in combating SARS to the quick manner in which the country initially reacted. \u201cAfter Carlo identified the disease, we were able to influence the hospital to take the right infection control measures very quickly,\u201d said Pascale Brudon, the WHO representative in Viet Nam.\n\nThe commitment of the Vietnamese government came soon thereafter, including high-level support for a WHO coordinated response in Hanoi. \u201cThe first priority was to contain the disease and monitor each case,\u201d said Brudon. International collaboration to combat SARS came quickly via the Japanese government and M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, who both worked under the umbrella of the WHO initiative in Viet Nam.\n\nViet Nam was fortunate in that the country had only a single index case, who spent less than 3 days in Hanoi prior to hospitalization. This short time in the community effectively limited opportunities to transmit the SARS virus to a contained hospital environment.\n\nViet Nam\u2019s northern Quang Ninh province recently began barring Chinese tourists at its overland border with China in an effort to prevent importation of SARS. This move comes ahead of any decision by the Vietnamese national government to seal its border with China indefinitely, as has been recommended by the country\u2019s ministry of health.\n\nCaution urged in the use of diagnostic tests WHO is currently working with four major laboratories to develop a clinically validated diagnostic test for SARS. Standard test reagents are being established to assess the quality of the test and ensure its reliability. When the test has been developed and clinically validated, it can be used reliably to confirm cases of SARS. However, test development and validation are expected to take at least another two weeks.\n\nIn the meantime, laboratories in a growing number of countries have developed SARS diagnostic tests, often based on information made available at the WHO web site. It is extremely important for national authorities and medical and hospital staff to understand the limitations of currently available tests. Their use as the basis for treatment decisions may give a false sense of security that can allow persons carrying the SARS virus, and therefore capable of infecting others, to escape detection.\n\nPCR tests can detect genetic material of the SARS virus in various specimens, including blood, stool, respiratory secretions, and tissue samples. Primers, which are the key pieces for a PCR test, have been made publicly available on the WHO web site by laboratories in the WHO network. The primers have since been used by many countries around the world.\n\nThese currently available PCR tests are very specific but lack sensitivity. This means that negative test results cannot be relied on as proof that a patient is not infected with the SARS virus.\n\nIn the absence of a reliable diagnostic test, national authorities are strongly advised to continue to base decisions concerning what constitutes both a suspect and a probable case of SARS on the present clinical and epidemiological case definition, and not to rely on the results of diagnostic tests. WHO advises that all suspect and probable SARS cases be placed in isolation and managed according to strict procedures of infection control.\n\nAll other currently available diagnostic tests also have important limitations. The ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay) test detects antibodies in the serum of SARS patients reliably, but only as from about day 21 after the onset of clinical signs and symptoms. Immunofluorescence assay tests detect antibodies in serum of SARS patients, but only after about day 10 following the onset of clinical signs and symptoms. Moreover, the test is demanding. Reliable results depend on the use of fixed SARS virus, an immunofluorescence microscope, and an experienced microscopist.\n\nVirus in specimens from SARS patients can also be detected by infecting cell cultures and growing the virus. Once isolated, the virus must be identified as the SARS virus with further tests. Cell culture, which is the only method of demonstrating the existence of a live virus, is a very demanding and time-consuming test.\n\nUpdate on cases and countries\n\nAs of today, a cumulative total of 4649 cases with 274 deaths have been reported from 26 countries. This represents an additional 210 cases and 11 deaths when compared with yesterday. The new deaths were reported in China (5) and Hong Kong SAR (6).\n\nIn China, the Ministry of Health has today informed WHO of 180 newly reported probable cases. The breakdown by location is Beijing (103), Inner Mongolia (23), Guangdong (15), Tianjin (13), Hebei (12), Shanxi (11), and one case each in Henan, Guangxi, and Sichuan. These latest figures bring the cumulative number of probable cases reported in China to 2601. Among health workers, a total of 38 new probable cases were reported from Beijing (17), Tianjin (9), Hebei (5), Inner Mongolia (5), Shanxi (1), and Guangdong (1).\n\nBeijing reported 3 deaths, Shanxi 1, and Guangdong 1, bringing the cumulative number of deaths in China to 115. The fact that cases continue to occur in health workers underscores the need for better infection control in hospitals. In Beijing, WHO is still awaiting data giving dates of onset and the location of cases in order to fully assess the situation.",

The new figures bring the cumulative number of reported probable cases in China to 2422.\n\nTwenty-one provinces have now reported probable cases, with another five provinces reporting suspected cases.\n\nOf the 125 new cases, 24 occurred among health workers, including 17 in Beijing. Altogether, China has reported 541 cases in health workers during the course of its SARS outbreak, which began in mid-November 2002.\n\nBeijing has reported the highest number of new cases (89), followed by Guangdong (15), and Inner Mongolia (11). Beijing reported 4 new deaths, bringing the cumulative number of SARS deaths in China to 110.\n\nWith a cumulative total of 1359 cases, Guangdong has the highest total number of probable cases, followed by Beijing, with 774 probable cases.\n\nThe number of reported cases in Beijing is increasing on a daily basis, and WHO is following the situation there closely. Data provided to date do not allow determination of whether newly reported cases are old SARS cases only now coming to light, or newly detected cases. Better interpretation of reports, and a more complete assessment of the underlying situation, require information on date of onset and location of cases. WHO has proposed to Beijing city government officials a meeting, scheduled for tomorrow, of WHO technical staff with Beijing disease experts in order to review reporting procedures.\n\nYesterday Beijing authorities closed elementary and middle schools early as an extension of the already planned national May Day holidays. Schools have been asked to inform parents, teachers, and visitors about the symptoms of SARS. Persons with symptoms have been asked not to visit schools. School authorities have been asked to conduct close monitoring and to send home any students, teachers, other staff, and visitors showing symptoms suggestive of SARS.\n\nIn Shanghai, the WHO team of experts continued visits to hospitals and the Shanghai Centre for Disease Control. The team has also examined procedures for contact tracing. The team will present its findings tomorrow and return to Beijing on Saturday.\n\nUpdate on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 4439 cases with 263 deaths have been reported from 26 countries.

        "Description of the Situation": "WHO extends its SARS-related travel advice to Beijing and Shanxi Province in China and to Toronto Canada \n\n23 April 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported\n\nAs a result of ongoing assessments as to the nature of outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Beijing and Shanxi Province, China, and in Toronto, Canada, WHO is now recommending, as a measure of precaution, that persons planning to travel to these destinations consider postponing all but essential travel. This temporary advice, which is an extension of travel advice previously issued for Guangdong Province and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China will be reassessed in three weeks time.\n\nFollowing global alerts about cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), issued by WHO on 12 and 15 March, national authorities have heightened surveillance for suspect and probable cases. In many countries, prompt detection and isolation of initial cases have prevented further transmission altogether or held additional cases to a very small number.\n\nOn 27 March, WHO recommended additional measures aimed at preventing the travel-related spread of SARS. These recommended measures, which include screening of air passengers departing from certain areas, continue to apply.\n\nOn 2 April, WHO recommended that persons travelling to Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Guangdong Province, China consider postponing all but essential travel. This temporary recommendation has been reassessed daily and remains in effect.\n\nSubsequent information from the Chinese government about the magnitude of the SARS outbreaks in Beijing and Shanxi Province has been carefully reviewed by WHO. This assessment has considered the magnitude of the outbreak, including both the number of prevalent cases and the daily number of new cases, the extent of local chains of transmission, and evidence that travellers are becoming infected while in one area and then subsequently exporting the disease elsewhere. On the basis of this assessment, WHO is extending its 2 April travel advice to include Beijing and Shanxi Province.\n\nUsing the same criteria, WHO has assessed the SARS situation in Toronto, Canada. The outbreak in this area has continued to grow in magnitude and has affected groups outside the initial risk groups of hospital workers, their families and other close person-to-person contacts, although all the cases reported have identified links to known SARS cases. In addition, a small number of persons with SARS, now in other countries in the world, appear to have acquired the infection while in Toronto. On the basis of this information, WHO is also including Toronto in the extension of its SARS-related travel advice.\n\n\nThis advice will be re-examined in three weeks time, which is twice the maximum incubation period of SARS.\n\nThe WHO travel advice is issued in order to protect public health and reduce opportunities for further international spread. SARS is a new disease, first recognized in late February, that has spread along the routes of international air travel. As of 22 April, a cumulative total of 3947 cases had been reported from 25 countries on five continents. Precautionary measures aim to reduce the impact of SARS and contain the disease while it is still in a relatively early stage.\n\nThe SARS situation is assessed on a daily basis to determine whether other areas need to be included in the travel advice and if additional precautionary measures are required.\n\nAll WHO SARS alerts, travel advice, daily cumulative case counts and other information are available at the  WHO web site.",

        "Description of the Situation": "Unanswered questions: a critical point in the evolution of SARS\n\n19 April 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported\n\nAs probable SARS cases continue to be reported from a growing number of countries, WHO is taking stock of what is known about the new disease, particularly concerning its mode of spread, and what remains a puzzle.\n\nThe agent that causes SARS has now been conclusively identified. The SARS virus is a new coronavirus unlike any other known human or animal virus in the Coronavirus family. Because the virus is new, much about its behaviour is poorly understood. Key questions, which are undergoing intense study, include stages in the course of infection when virus shedding may be highest, and the various concentrations of virus in different body fluids. Scientists are also working to determine the amount of time the virus can survive in the environment on both dry surfaces and in suspension, including in faecal matter.\n\nThe vast majority of countries reporting probable SARS cases are dealing with a small number of imported cases. Experience has shown that when these cases are promptly detected, isolated, and managed according to strict procedures of infection control, further spread to hospital staff and family members either does not occur at all or results in a very small number of secondary infections. These experiences confirm abundant early evidence that the SARS virus spreads, in the vast majority of cases, through exposure to respiratory droplets during close face-to-face contact.\n\nHowever, information now emerging from outbreaks in Hong Kong and Canada is raising some important new questions about SARS. In Hong Kong, a large and sudden cluster of almost simultaneous cases (321) seen in residents of the Amoy Gardens housing estate has raised the possibility of transmission from an environmental source.\n\nIn addition, reports from Hong Kong health authorities indicate that patients in this cluster depart in some ways from the previously established clinical picture. The disease appears to be more severe both in Amoy residents and in related cases among hospital staff. Around 20% of Amoy-related cases require intensive care, compared with 10% seen in non-Amoy cases. Some deaths are now occurring in younger, previously healthy persons as well as in the elderly and persons with underlying disease. Around 66% of Amoy Gardens patients present with diarrhoea as a symptom, compared with 2% to 7% of cases in other outbreaks.\n\nSpeculation centres on whether these cases represent infection with high virus loads, as might occur following exposure to a concentrated environmental source, or whether the virus may have mutated into a more virulent form. Viruses in the Coronavirus family are known to mutate frequently.\n\nIn Canada, concern has centred around a cluster of 31 suspect and probable cases in members of a charismatic religious group, the health care workers who have treated them, and close family and social contacts. The outbreak is particularly disturbing because of its potential to move into the wider community. Large meetings of the religious group at two events, on 28 and 29 March, may have led to multiple additional exposures, especially among the members of this close-knit religious group.\n\nIntense contact tracing, home quarantine, and close follow-up by health officials may work to prevent further spread of cases in the general community. The index case in this cluster has been traced to contact, in a hospital emergency room, with a subsequently fatal SARS case. The outbreak is regarded as a test case of whether rigorous contact tracing and other stringent public health measures can contain further spread even when very large numbers of persons may have been exposed.\n\nThis index case has also been linked to three of four SARS cases concentrated in the same block of a 247-unit condominium in Toronto. As the fourth case could not be linked to direct contact with a SARS patient, some speculation arose concerning possible environmental contamination within the building as the source of the fourth infection. However, all four cases occurred in early April, with 4 April being the date of onset of the fourth case. The incubation period has now passed with no further cases detected. There appears to be little risk that the case arose from an environmental source.\n\nViet Nam A week has passed since Viet Nam officials reported a new probable case of SARS. No new deaths have occurred during this period. The situation in Hanoi seems to have stabilized. Following the introduction of infection control measures in the French Hospital, the transmission of SARS appears to have been contained. Ten patients are now listed as recovering from SARS, none of whom is listed as in critical condition.\n\nThe Vietnamese government is considering closing its land border with China in an attempt to prevent the importation of SARS cases. In a proposal submitted to the Prime Minister by the Ministry of Health, the 1,130 kilometre border with China would be sealed indefinitely to overland visitors.\n\nWHO officials in Viet Nam said earlier this week that while Viet Nam appears to have controlled the SARS outbreak within its borders, it still faces the threat of massive importation of the disease from China.\n\nUpdate on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 3547 cases with 182 deaths have been reported from 25 countries. Compared with yesterday, 12 new deaths, all in Hong Kong SAR, have been reported.",

        "Description of the Situation": "Update on Hong Kong and China, first SARS case reported in India\n\n18 April 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported\n\nHong Kong: investigation of Amoy Gardens cluster The Hong Kong Secretary for Environment, Transport and Works, in collaboration with eight other government agencies, has released the results of an extensive investigation of an unusual cluster of SARS cases concentrated in the Amoy Gardens housing estate.\n\nThe investigation, which drew on epidemiological, environmental, and laboratory studies, has identified sewage contaminated with the SARS virus as the probable point source of exposure. Epidemiological investigation has focused on the role of a 33-year-old man who developed symptoms of SARS on 14 March and visited a relative in Block E, Amoy Gardens on 14 and 19 March. His symptoms at that time included diarrhoea.\n\nBased on the epidemiology of the outbreak, officials believe that this patient, who is linked to the infection of two relatives and two nurses, was the source of the outbreak. Subsequent rapid spread to other residents (321 cases of as 15 April) is thought to have involved defective U-traps in bathrooms, an amplifying effect of bathroom exhaust fans, a cracked sewer vent pipe serving Block E, and an aerodynamic effect in a lightwell to which bathroom windows opened.\n\nLaboratory investigations confirmed the presence of the SARS virus in a swab from the toilet bowl in the bathroom of a SARS patient, but not in numerous other environmental samples.\n\n\u201cThis is a plausible hypothesis,\u201d says David Heymann, Executive Director of communicable diseases at WHO. \u201cThis is the kind of study that is needed to find what it is in the environment that is transmitting this disease.\u201d\n\nFurther work will be needed to reach firm conclusions about the source of the outbreak and the unusual way in which infection has spread.\n\nThe study found no epidemiological or laboratory evidence that the SARS virus was transmitted by air, water, or infected dust aerosols. \u201cIt is reassuring that speculations about a possible airborne transmission have not been borne out by the evidence available to date,\u201d says Heymann.\n\nThe transmission of SARS within the Amoy Gardens estate is the first known instance involving a possible environmental spread of the virus. Thorough multi-disciplinary investigation of this unusual outbreak, as is now under way, is fully warranted. Once the outbreak is fully understood, the next important step will be to develop measures that can prevent other instances of environmental spread occurring under similar circumstances.\n\nChina advises officials on SARS China\u2019s top leaders cautioned officials this morning not to cover up the spread of SARS. Yesterday, during an urgent meeting of China\u2019s highest ruling body presided over by President Hu Jintao, Beijing explicitly warned against the covering up of SARS cases and demanded the \u201caccurate, timely and honest reporting of the SARS situation,\u201d according to Xinhua, the country\u2019s official news agency. China\u2019s leaders called SARS a serious threat to the nation\u2019s reform, development and stability, adding that party and government leaders would be held accountable for the situations in their respective jurisdictions.\n\nEarlier this week, the WHO Beijing team estimated that Beijing may have as many as 200 cases of SARS, rather than the 37 officially reported. The team recommended that Beijing improve its reporting system, possibly using as a model procedures followed in Guangdong Province, where the daily SARS reports are considered reliable and transparent. WHO experts also recommended that Beijing revise its definition of what constitutes a \u201csuspect\u201d SARS case.\n\nAt present, many patients reported by Beijing as \u201csuspect\u201d would be classified as \u201cprobable\u201d according to the case definition set out by WHO and used in official notifications of cases to WHO. As WHO reports only probable cases in its daily cumulative totals, such a change on the part of Beijing would result in a large increase in the number of cases notified to WHO.\n\nFirst SARS case reported in India India reported its first case of SARS yesterday. The National Institute of Virology in the western coastal state of Goa confirmed the presence of the new coronavirus which causes SARS, in samples from the patient. He is said to have recovered, and is still being kept in isolation after visiting Singapore, Hong Kong, and briefly stopping over in Mumbai.\n\nThere have been fears that if the SARS virus reached India, it could spread rapidly in the subcontinent\u2019s crowded cities and health facilities. WHO officials believe it is good news that the one case has been detected and reported, as this indicates that the surveillance system is on high alert and working well. As has been demonstrated in many countries, prompt detection of new cases, proper management, and efficient contact tracing can prevent isolated cases from infecting others.\n\nUpdate on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 3461 cases with 170 deaths have been reported from 25 countries on five continents. This represents an increase of 72 new cases and 5 deaths since the last WHO update. The deaths occurred in Hong Kong SAR (4) and Singapore (1).",

        "Description of the Situation": "Situation in China and Hong Kong, status of diagnostic tests\n\n17 April 2003 \n\nDisease Outbreak Reported \n\nChina Chinese authorities have today reported 12 new cases of SARS. Nine new cases were reported from Guangdong Province, and one each in Inner Mongolia and Sichuan Province. Ningxia, a poor province in the remote western part of the country, announced its first case today.\n\nBeijing reported no new cases and no new deaths.\n\nToday\u2019s figures do not include cases in Beijing\u2019s military hospitals. The military hospitals, which are not obliged by Chinese law to report cases to health authorities, have been the focus of considerable rumours over the past several days. A WHO team began visits to Beijing\u2019s military hospitals yesterday.\n\nThe recent decision of military hospitals in Guangdong Province to report SARS cases to the authorities may set an important precedent. WHO staff in China have been further encouraged by the presence of national surveillance and reporting teams in provinces that are now reporting cases. The presence of national SARS teams actively searching for cases is a welcome sign that the severity of the SARS threat is being taken seriously by the government.\n\nAn additional WHO team will be travelling to Shanghai next week.\n\nHong Kong: investigation of the Amoy Gardens cluster The Hong Kong Department of Health, together with the Department of Environment, Transport and Works, has today released the results of an extensive investigation into the possible cause of a large cluster of SARS cases among residents in the Amoy Gardens housing estate. The report draws on findings from numerous studies designed to determine whether an environmental source of the SARS virus might explain the large and unusual cluster of SARS cases.\n\nAs of 15 April, health authorities had reported a total of 321 individuals affected by SARS who are residents in Amoy Gardens. A large proportion of cases are concentrated in vertically linked flats in a single building, Block E.\n\nAttention has focused on possible transmission via the sewage system. Among several unusual features, the Amoy cluster includes a high proportion of cases presenting with diarrhoea, estimated at about 60%. In most other clusters of cases, diarrhoea has typically been seen in only 2% to 7% of cases.\n\nWHO epidemiologists are now studying the report, which was submitted to WHO earlier today by Hong Kong\u2019s Department of Health.\n\nStatus of diagnostic tests Scientists in the WHO network of collaborating laboratories met in Geneva yesterday to map out research priorities for the coming month. The network also announced conclusive proof, from animal trials, that a new coronavirus, discovered by the group last month, is the agent that causes SARS.\n\nWith the cause of SARS now proven, network scientists are giving top priority to the development of better diagnostic tests. The first step is the development of a data bank of specimens from a range of SARS patients in different countries. The scientists are also building a bank of specimens taken from individual patients at different stages of disease, including recovery.\n\nSuch a time-series of specimens will be vital in developing a test that is capable of detecting virus at the first stage when people become capable of infecting others. It will also help determine the stage in the course of the illness when recovered patients can safely return to their jobs and families with no risk of infecting others.\n\nOther plans for the coming weeks include the development of a genetic library of specimens from SARS patients from different parts of the world. It is not yet known whether genetic differences in the coronavirus, which has now been fully sequenced by several network laboratories, will have significance for work on drug and vaccine research and development.\n\nExisting PCR diagnostic tests are insufficiently powerful to rule out, with confidence, the presence of the virus in suspect or probable SARS cases early in the course of the disease.\n\nWHO has been concerned that use of the current PCR test kit, which is being made available by a German biotechnology company initially at no cost, may produce test results that give a false sense of security, allowing persons carrying the virus to slip past undetected.\n\nWithout a more reliable diagnostic tool, hospital staff confronted with a suspect SARS case have no option other than to isolate patients and manage them according to strict infection control practices as precautionary measures. Such measures are stressful for patients and place a considerable strain on health services.\n\nUpdate on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 3389 cases with 165 deaths have been reported from twenty five countries. Countries reporting their first probable cases on today\u2019s list include Australia (3) and Mongolia (3).\n\nA large number of suspect SARS cases turn out, on further investigation, to have other, common causes.",

        "Description of the Situation": "Coronavirus never before seen in humans is the cause of SARS\n\nUnprecedented collaboration identifies new pathogen in record time\n\n\n16 April 2003  Disease Outbreak Reported \n\n\nGENEVA -- Today, the World Health Organization announced that a new pathogen, a member of the coronavirus family never before seen in humans, is the cause of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The speed at which this virus was identified is the result of the close international collaboration of 13 laboratories from 10 countries. While many lines of evidence have found strong associations between this virus and the disease over the last weeks, final confirmation came today.\n\n\u201cThe pace of SARS research has been astounding,\u201d said Dr. David Heymann, Executive Director, WHO Communicable Diseases programmes. \u201cBecause of an extraordinary collaboration among laboratories from countries around the world, we now know with certainty what causes SARS.\u201d\n\nThe successful identification of the coronavirus means that scientists can now confidently turn to other SARS challenges. For example, various laboratories continue to work to unravel the genetic information of the SARS virus and compare the sequences obtained from viruses in different parts of the world. Experts are gathering at WHO this week to map future work on SARS.\n\n\u201cToday, the collaboration continues as top laboratory researchers have come to WHO to design the next steps, a strategy for transforming these basic research discoveries into diagnostic tools which will help us to successfully control this disease,\u201d said Heymann. \u201cNow we can move away from methods like isolation and quarantines and move aggressively towards modern intervention strategies including specific treatments and eventually vaccination. With the establishment of the causative agent, we are a crucial step closer.\u201d\n\nThis collaboration has brought together leading scientific expertise, and was established after WHO issued a global alert on SARS on 12 March 2003. The priority has been to find the cause and to develop diagnostic tests. Two laboratories in China recently joined this network of laboratories from Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America.\n\n\u201cToday, the first part of the mission of our network has been fulfilled, as researchers have both detected a hitherto unknown virus and established it as the cause of SARS. The new coronavirus has been named by WHO and member laboratories as \u201cSARS virus, \u201d said Dr Albert Osterhaus, the Director of Virology at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam. Erasmus completed the work to definitely prove that the new coronavirus causes SARS.\n\nOver the past three weeks, due to the urgency surrounding the worldwide threat to health of SARS and early indications this was a new member of the coronavirus family, research has proceeded under the assumption that SARS was caused by a new coronavirus.\n\nThe 13 laboratories have been working on meeting Koch\u2019s postulates, necessary to prove disease causation. These postulates stipulate that to be the causal agent, a pathogen must meet four conditions: it must be found in all cases of the disease, it must be isolated from the host and grown in pure culture, it must reproduce the original disease when introduced into a susceptible host, and it must be found in the experimental host so infected.\n\nCredit for the coronavirus findings, which definitively pinpoints the cause of SARS, is attributed to the 13 laboratories, working in conjunction with WHO.\n\n\u201cThe people in this network have put aside profit and prestige to work together to find the cause of this new disease and to find way new ways of fighting it,\u201d said Dr Klaus St\u00f6hr, WHO virologist and the coordinator of the collaborative research network. \u201cIn this globalized world, such collaboration is the only way forward in tackling emerging diseases.\u201d\n\nWHO and the network of laboratories dedicate their detection and characterization of the SARS virus to Dr Carlo Urbani, the WHO scientist who first alerted the world to the existence of SARS in Hanoi, Vietnam, and who died from the disease in Bangkok on 29 March 2003.\n\nFor more information contact:\n\nDick Thompson - Communication Officer Communicable Disease Prevention, Control and Eradication  WHO, Geneva  Telephone: (+41 22) 791 26 84 Email: [email\u00a0protected]",

        "Description of the Situation": "Status of diagnostic test, significance of \u201csuper spreaders\u201d, situation in China \n\n15 April 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported\n\nSARS diagnostic test kit made available to members of WHO network Scientists participating in the WHO collaborative network of laboratories have developed several diagnostic tests for SARS. These include a so-called \u201cPCR\u201d test, which allows detection of the distinctive genetic information of a virus.\n\nPrimers, which are the key pieces for a PCR test, were made publicly available by network laboratories on the open WHO web site (http://www.who.int/csr/sars/primers/en/) on 4 April. The primers have since been used by numerous countries around the world.\n\nWHO scientists are now increasingly optimistic that the current PCR diagnostic test for SARS can rapidly be fine-tuned to a stage ready for roll out. Fine-tuning is needed because of important limitations in the ability of the current test to rule out the presence of coronavirus in SARS cases.\n\nYesterday, the Bernhard-Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg, Germany informed WHO that primers developed there are being made available, in the form of a ready-to-use kit, by a Hamburg-based biotechnology firm. Apart from ease of use, the test kit has the advantage of built-in quality control. WHO was further informed by the Hamburg Institute that the test will be offered at no cost to laboratories participating in the WHO collaborative network.\n\nThe network, which includes leading laboratories from ten countries, was set up last month to expedite identification of the SARS causative agent and, in parallel, to rapidly develop a diagnostic test.\n\nInitial testing of the kit by network members is expected to quickly yield the data needed to assess the test\u2019s performance, in comparison with primers developed by other WHO network laboratories. The ability to detect persons infected with the SARS virus at an early stage is a key measure of performance. WHO has been concerned that weaknesses in earlier experimental tests for SARS would allow too many virus carriers to slip past undetected.\n\nExisting PCR tests are very specific but may not detect all patients who are excreting coronavirus. Early and reliable detection of the SARS virus in samples will be of great assistance in helping health care staff determine which persons presenting with fever and other suspicion-arousing symptoms should be immediately isolated and managed according to strict procedures of infection control. Such procedures will, in turn, greatly reduce the likelihood that infection will spread to others.\n\nVarious WHO network laboratories are endeavouring to improve their PCR testing protocols and primers to increase their reliability.\n\nThe Bernhard-Nocht Institute is a member of the WHO network of collaborating laboratories. The rapid development of the test kit is one example of how scientific knowledge, being generated by dedicated scientists, can be rapidly translated into a practical control tool.\n\nExplanation of so-called SARS \u201csuper-spreaders\u201d \u201cSuper-spreader\u201d is a term that has been used to describe certain individuals with atypical pneumonia, now recognized as cases of SARS, who have been implicated in spreading the disease to numerous other individuals.\n\nThe phenomenon of a \u201csuper-spreader\u201d, which is not a recognized medical condition, dates back to the early days of the outbreak. At that time, when SARS was just becoming known as a severe new disease, many patients were thought to be suffering from atypical pneumonia having another cause, and were therefore not treated as special cases requiring special precautions of isolation and infection control.\n\nAs a result, stringent infection control measures were not in place. In the absence of protective measures, many health care workers, relatives, and hospital visitors were exposed to the SARS virus and subsequently developed SARS.\n\nSince infection control measures have been put in place, the number of new cases of SARS arising from a single SARS source case has been significantly reduced.\n\nWhen investigating current chains of continuing transmission, it is important to look for points in the history of case detection and patient management when procedures for infection control may have broken down.\n\nChina The WHO team of experts in Beijing was today granted permission to visit military hospitals. The situation of SARS cases in certain military hospitals has been the source of numerous rumours concerning the magnitude of the SARS outbreak. The WHO team has so far visited one such hospital but hopes to visit others soon.\n\nThe decision by Beijing authorities is a welcome indication of China\u2019s willingness to come to terms with the SARS outbreak on the mainland. Yesterday, China\u2019s president Hu Jintao said on state television that he was \u201cvery worried\u201d by SARS.\n\nThe WHO Beijing team is expected to finish its preliminary investigation on the status of SARS in China tomorrow. Additional WHO teams will travel soon to other parts of China.\n\nUpdate on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 3235 cases of SARS, with 154 deaths, have been reported from 22 countries. This represents an increase of 66 new cases and ten deaths compared with the previous day. Nine of the ten deaths occurred in Hong Kong SAR. One death was reported in Singapore.",

        "Description of the Situation": "Situation in China, status of scientific and clinical knowledge\n\n14 April 2003\n\nDisease Outbreak Reported\n\nSituation in China China has today reported 109 new probable cases of SARS and 6 deaths, bringing the cumulative total to 1418 cases and 64 deaths. The largest number of cases occurred in Shanxi Province, where 47 new cases were reported. In addition, two provinces reported SARS cases for the first time \u2013 10 in Inner Mongolia and 3 in Fujian.\n\nThe reports indicate that the nationwide surveillance system, recently introduced by Chinese authorities, is working to detect and report cases. However, questions remain about the capacity of some provinces to cope with the challenge of SARS.\n\nLast week, the interim report of the WHO investigative team concluded that the health system in Guangdong Province, where the first recognized cases of SARS occurred in mid-November, had responded well to the outbreak. However, the report noted many concerns about the ability of other provinces, that lack Guangdong\u2019s strong health system, to respond promptly and effectively to SARS.\n\nWhile Beijing authorities appear to have contained transmission in some hospitals, they have not yet granted WHO experts permission to visit military hospitals, which have been the focus of numerous rumours. WHO staff in Beijing have expressed particular concern about the official response to rumours and the apparent absence of rigorous contact tracing.\n\nWHO is currently exploring ways to strengthen its support to China. Shanghai has requested a visit from a WHO team. Teams to meet this request and follow up on other needs in China are now being assembled by WHO and will soon travel to China.\n\nStatus of scientific knowledge Canadian scientists working around the clock have completed full sequencing of the genome of the SARS virus. This is a major step forward that will boost the development of better diagnostic tests and underpin work on a vaccine.\n\nThe rapid sequencing of the SARS virus genome was facilitated by collaboration with numerous other scientists, also working non-stop, at laboratories in a WHO network set up in mid-March.\n\nA PCR test, developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has been shown to be ten times more sensitive than previous PCR tests for SARS. WHO experts hope that the test will be ready for roll out by the end of this week.\n\nStatus of clinical knowledge Data available to WHO indicate that 96% of persons developing SARS recover spontaneously. The focus now is on the roughly 4% who are dying. WHO will hold a clinical teleconference on Wednesday to gather international experiences in the management of SARS patients and pool data on the results of various therapeutic regimens.\n\nUpdate on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 3169 cases of SARS, with 144 deaths, have been reported to WHO from 21 countries. This represents an increase of 213 cases and 25 deaths since the last update on Saturday.\n\nIndonesia, the Philippines, and Sweden report their first probable cases (1 in each country) today. Japan, which had previously reported four probable cases, was removed from the list as these cases were determined to have other causes.\n\nChina, with 1418 cases and 64 deaths, remains the most seriously affected area. Hong Kong SAR, with 1190 cases and 47 deaths, is the second most seriously affected area. Three of the deaths in Hong Kong over the weekend occurred in persons under the age of 50, marking a departure from a previously pattern in which SARS caused deaths primarily in the elderly or in persons with pre-existing disease.",

        "Description of the Situation": "Affected areas, status of SARS outbreaks in individual countries\n\n12 April 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported\n\nAffected areas On Friday, WHO added Beijing, China to its list of SARS-affected areas. Areas are added to the list following indication that chains of local transmission are occurring. The greatest concern arises when cases occur outside the established risk groups of health care workers and persons in close face-to-face contact with patients, such as household contacts and hospital visitors.\n\nIn addition to Beijing, other affected areas in China include Guangdong Province, Hong Kong SAR, Shanxi Province, and Taiwan Province. Toronto, Singapore, and Hanoi are also listed as affected.\n\nIn most other countries reporting SARS cases, the disease remains confined to a few imported cases, with no or very little spread of infection to others.\n\nChina A WHO team of five experts has been invited by the Beijing Health Bureau to visit health facilities and review the SARS situation in Beijing. The invitation followed WHO concern about management of the SARS situation by health authorities, particularly in relation to case reporting and contact tracing.\n\nThe meetings, which began on Friday, will continue throughout next week. Specific objectives are to support the strengthening of surveillance and reporting, clinical management, infection control, and laboratory evaluation of cases.\n\nNo reports from China were received today.\n\nHong Kong Hong Kong has today reported a cumulative total of 1108 cases with 35 deaths. This represents an increase of 49 new cases admitted to hospital with symptoms of SARS, and 3 deaths when compared with yesterday. Of the cases newly admitted to hospital, 3 are in health care workers, and 11 are from the Amoy Gardens housing estate.\n\nThe majority of Hong Kong\u2019s cases are clustered in hospitals and in the densely populated Amoy Gardens housing estate. Health authorities are continuing to investigate a possible environmental factor that may explain the concentration of cases in a single wing of a single building, Block E. Health officials are also investigating whether an outbreak in a second housing estate may be related to the Amoy Gardens outbreak.\n\nThe Department of Health has today posted on its web site a detailed list of buildings where residents have developed SARS.\n\nSingapore Singapore has today reported a cumulative total of 147 SARS cases of which 60 remain hospitalized, with 15 in intensive care. Recent concern has centered on clusters of SARS cases seen in health workers, inpatients, and visitors at Singapore General Hospital and Ton Tock Seng Hospital.\n\nWHO has collaborated with health authorities in investigations and contact tracing that have linked most cases in the hospital outbreaks to a single \u201csuper-spreader.\u201d This patient was treated at Ton Tock Seng Hospital from 5 to 20 March, where he is thought to have become infected. He was subsequently admitted to Singapore General Hospital on 24 March. The patient showed a very atypical clinical course before being isolated on 2 April. This late isolation is thought to explain, in part, the large number of exposed and infected individuals linked to the single patient.\n\nOngoing investigations have linked the outbreaks at Singapore General Hospital, Ton Tock Seng Hospital, and other hospitals in Singapore to clear trains of transmission\n\nViet Nam In Viet Nam, one new case was reported and one case was removed from the list. The cumulative number of reported cases (62) remains the same as yesterday. High vigilance, excellent contact tracing, and good infection control are in place and are expected to keep the number of new cases, associated with the initial outbreak, small.\n\nCanada Health Canada is today reporting 101 probable SARS cases. All Canadian cases have occurred in persons who have travelled to Asia or had contact with SARS cases in the household or in a health-care setting. Ontario is reporting 98 probable cases. Three probable cases are reported in British Columbia.\n\nUpdate on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 2960 cases, with 119 deaths, have been reported from 19 countries. This represents an increase of 70 cases and 3 deaths when compared with yesterday. No reports from China were received today.\n\nThe 3 new deaths were reported in Hong Kong SAR. New cases were reported in Canada (3), Hong Kong (49), Taiwan, China (2), Singapore (14), Thailand (1), and the United Kingdom (1).\n\n12 April 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported",

        "Description of the Situation": "One month into the global SARS outbreak: Status of the outbreak and lessons for the immediate future \n\n11 April 2003  Disease Outbreak Reported \n\nOne month after declaring SARS a global threat to health, Dr David L. Heymann, Executive Director of WHO\u2019s communicable disease programmes, gives an overview of where we stand with the epidemic \u2013 what is known about this emerging disease and the unique virus that causes it, and how outbreaks in the \u201chot zones\u201d around the world are evolving. He gives a chronology of key events and explains some of the actions taken to curb further spread. He also explains why SARS poses a particularly serious threat to health, and looks at the many puzzles this unusual disease presents. Several lessons for future infectious disease emergencies, including the next influenza pandemic and a possible bioterrorist attack, are also described.\n\nStatus of the outbreak\n\u201cHot zones\u201d of concern\nChina\nCanada\nHong Kong\nViet Nam\nSingapore\nNew coronavirus discovered \nDiagnostic tests\nPresent role of diagnostic tests\nA role out for other emergencies (influenza pandemic, bioterrorism)\nWhy SARS is such a serious threat\nChronology of events\nLessons: the value of innovation and international collaboration\n\n\nStatus of the global SARS outbreak and lessons for the immediate futureDavid L. Heymann Executive Director, Communicable Diseases, WHO\n\n Current status of the SARS outbreak At this moment, public health authorities, physicians and scientists around the world are struggling to cope with a severe and rapidly spreading new disease in humans, severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS. This appears to be the first severe and easily transmissible new disease to emerge in the 21st century. Though much about the disease remains poorly understood, including the exact identity of the causative virus, we do know that it has features that allow it to spread rapidly along international air travel routes.\n\nAs of 10 April, 2781 SARS cases, with 111 deaths, have been reported to WHO from 17 countries on three continents. Some outbreaks have reassuring features. A high awareness of SARS symptoms among travellers and the medical and nursing professions has often resulted in good management of imported cases \u2013 prompt isolation of patients and management according to strict procedures of infection control. As a result, many countries having only a single or a few imported cases have experienced no further spread to hospital staff, families of patients and hospital visitors, or the community at large.\n\nThe list of countries and continents reporting suspect or probable SARS cases will no doubt continue to grow due to heightened global vigilance, knowledge about symptoms and exposures, and awareness of the need for immediate isolation of cases and strict infection control. So long as these measures are followed, the detection of first cases in countries need not be interpreted as evidence that SARS is continuing to spread. Tabular information on countries reporting SARS and the  cumulative total of cases and deaths is published each day on the WHO SARS web site.\n\n \u201cHot zones\u201d of concernDespite some positive signs that imported cases are not spreading further, outbreaks in China, Canada, Hong Kong, Hanoi, and Singapore have taken root in hospitals and beyond, and give rise to considerable concern. One of the most alarming features of SARS in these areas is its rapid spread in hospitals, where it has affected a large number of previously healthy health care workers. Many require intensive care, placing a huge strain on hospital facilities and staff. In countries, such as Canada, where cases occurred before WHO issued its global alert, SARS is continuing to spread despite the introduction of strict patient isolation and excellent infection control.\n\n China  On 9 April, a WHO investigative team, which had conducted interviews and studies in Guangdong Province since 3 April, presented its interim report on the SARS outbreak to Chinese authorities. The team concluded that the health system in Guangdong responded well to the outbreak, but that health systems in all other provinces had less capacity to cope with the severity of the challenge posed by SARS. Several recommendations for improvements were made in the report.\n\nThe team also found evidence of \u201csuper-spreaders\u201d in Guangdong, including one who is thought to have infected as many as 100 other persons. The outbreak is now thought to date back to at least 16 November, when an initial case was reported in Foshan City.\n\nParticular concern centres on the situation in Beijing. Yesterday, WHO deepened discussions with Beijing health authorities, particularly concerning the efficiency of systems for case reporting and contact tracing.\n\n Canada To date, Canada has reported 114 probable cases and 10 deaths. All cases have occurred in persons who have travelled to Asia or had close contact with SARS cases in households or health care facilities. Health Canada has taken several steps to protect the health of Canadians and the travelling public, and to reduce opportunities of transmitting the virus to others. Several Canadian schools and hospitals are closed.\n\n Hong Kong Hong Kong, with 998 cases and 30 deaths, is presently the hardest hit area. Health care workers continue to become infected in a growing number of hospitals. WHO learned this week that the chief executive of the Prince of Wales Hospital \u2013 the initial epicentre of the Hong Kong outbreak \u2013 is hospitalized with atypical pneumonia. Hospitals are becoming overwhelmed. A decision to suspend all primary, secondary, special schools and kindergartens until 6 April has been extended up to 21 April.\n\nMost disturbing is a large cluster of 268 SARS cases linked to the Amoy Gardens estate of high-rise apartment buildings. The vast majority of Amoy Gardens cases have been traced to vertically linked apartments in a single building, Block E. This pattern of transmission indicates that the disease has moved out of the health care setting and is now occurring within the community as secondary cases. Epidemiologists investigating the Amoy Gardens outbreak are considering the hypothesis that some form of environmental contamination, perhaps linked to a sewage or ventilation system, is the source of the large cluster of cases. Although transmission through the faecal-oral route is being considered as one possibility, no evidence of airborne transmission has been demonstrated to date. Virus has not been detected in animals, including cockroaches and rodents.\n\nYesterday, health authorities in Hong Kong announced that all household contacts of confirmed SARS patients will be required to confine themselves at home for up to 10 days with immediate effect. Household contacts can choose between confinement in their homes and confinement in holiday camps. No visitors are allowed during the confinement period, and permission to leave homes or camps will be granted only on exceptional grounds. During the confinement period, the Hong Kong Department of Health will conduct medical checks to monitor health, and the police force will conduct compliance checks.\n\n Viet Nam In Viet Nam, an epidemiologist from the Hanoi WHO office recognized the first case of SARS on 28 February at a French hospital in Hanoi. The number of cases increased rapidly but then stabilized on 24 March at 58 cases and remained stable for 8 consecutive days. As the maximum incubation period for SARS is thought to be 10 days, the stable number of cases over this period raised hope that Viet Nam\u2019s outbreak had been brought under control. However, on 3 April a probable SARS case was detected in a provincial hospital. Though the case could be linked back to the French hospital, the absence of isolation and rigorous infection control at the provincial hospital suggests that many hospital staff, patients, and visitors may have been exposed, thus possibly seeding further waves of cases. An additional three probable cases, both known to have had close contacts with cases, have been reported since 3 April.\n\n Singapore In Singapore, another of the earliest and hardest hit areas, 126 persons, including several children under the age of 18 years, have been diagnosed with SARS. Most disturbing are new and large clusters of suspected SARS cases among health workers, inpatients, and visitors in two interlinked wards at Singapore General Hospital and in a second hospital, Tan Tok Seng Hospital.\n\nIntense contact tracing and investigation of these clusters increasingly points to contact with a single Chinese man in his 60s who was treated at Singapore General Hospital from 5 to 20 March for chronic kidney disease and diabetes at Singapore General Hospital. WHO epidemiologists, in collaboration with national authorities, are finding increasing evidence that the Chinese patient might have been a so-called \u201csuper-spreader.\u201d\n\nIn SARS outbreaks, a \u201csuper-spreader\u201d is a source case who has, for as yet unknown reasons, infected a large number of persons. It remains unknown whether such \u201csuper-spreaders\u201d are persons secreting an exceptionally high amount of infectious material or whether some other factor, perhaps in the environment, is working to amplify transmission at some key phase of virus shedding.\n\n New coronavirus discovered  Through new mechanisms set up by WHO, progress on the research front has been unprecedented, particularly in the rapid discovery of a new coronavirus and the rapid development of diagnostic tests. The best scientists from around the world are working on these problems around the clock, and in an unprecedented spirit of collaboration against a threat of, as yet, unknown dimensions. Nonetheless, we still do not have conclusive proof that the new virus is indeed the cause of SARS. The results of animal experiments, which are currently being conducted by a laboratory in a WHO network, will be available soon and may provide the last pieces of evidence needed for definitive proof that SARS is caused by the newly discovered coronavirus. Furthermore, the findings will provide additional evidence to understand the role of metapneumovirus as a possible \u201chelper virus\u201d in persons co-infected with the new coronavirus.\n\n Diagnostic tests The development of a diagnostic test has proved more problematic than hoped. Three tests are now available and are helping to improve understanding of how the virus causes disease in humans. However, all three tests have limitations as tools for bringing the SARS outbreak quickly under control.\n\nThe ELISA detects antibodies reliably but only from about day 20 after the onset of clinical symptoms. It therefore cannot be used to detect cases at an early stage before they have a chance to spread the infection to others.\n\nThe second test, an immunofluorescence assay (IFA), detects antibodies reliably as of day 10 of infection, but is a comparatively slow test that requires the growth of virus in cell culture.\n\nThe presently available PCR molecular test for detection of SARS virus genetic material is useful in the early stages of infection but produces many false-negatives. This means that many persons who actually carry the virus may not be detected \u2013 creating a dangerous sense of false security for a virus that is known to spread easily in close person-to-person contact.\n\n Present role of tests in diagnosis A positive test results indicates that a person is, or recently was, infected with the coronavirus. However, a negative test result does not guarantee that the person is not infected with the virus.\n\nAt present, reporting to WHO of probable SARS cases is based on an assessment of clinical symptoms, history \u2013 including travel history \u2013 of possible exposure to an infected person, and distinctive chest X-rays. The nine countries in the WHO laboratory network, namely Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Hong Kong SAR, the Netherlands, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America, are beginning to conduct routine laboratory testing of suspect and probable SARS cases. WHO has posted on its web site details about the test methodology that allows other countries to perform tests. However, more work is needed to produce a robust test that is capable rapidly and reliably detecting cases at an early stage of infection.\n\n SARS response: a roll out for other emergencies caused by infectious diseases Apart from the dimensions of the SARS outbreak apparent at this date, the sections below explain why this disease poses a particularly severe threat to international health, outline the chronology of events as SARS spread around the world, and discuss lessons, based on strengths and weaknesses of the global response, for the immediate future. These lessons are of great importance.\n\nThe SARS response is the roll out of a global alert and response activity under the revision of the International Health Regulations, which provide the legal framework for the surveillance and reporting of infectious disease and for the use of measures to prevent their international spread. SARS is showing how the alert and response activity works in practice for a newly identified disease. It also indicates how the system now in operation could apply to other highly significant infectious disease events, including the next influenza pandemic, the next emerging infection, and the deliberate release of a biological agent in an act of warfare or terrorism. The scientific community is now contending with an outbreak caused by a new virus. This creates an extra step in the containment response: identification and characterization of the causative agent, which then allows development of a diagnostic test, treatment protocols, and a scientifically sound basis for recommending control measures. This is a step that would not be needed should a biological attack occur using a well-known pathogen such as anthrax or smallpox. The response to an influenza pandemic would likewise not be dealing with an entirely new and poorly understood virus.\n\n SARS: a particularly serious threat to international health Although the last decades of the previous century witnessed the emergence of several new diseases, SARS needs to be regarded as a particularly serious threat for several reasons. If the SARS virus maintains its present pathogenicity and transmissibility, SARS could become the first severe new disease of the 21st century with global epidemic potential. As such, its clinical and epidemiological features, though poorly understood, give cause for particular alarm. With the notable exception of AIDS, most new diseases that emerged during the last two decades of the previous century or established endemicity in new geographical areas have features that limit their capacity to pose a major threat to international public health. Many (avian influenza, Nipah virus, Hendra virus, Haanta virus) failed to establish efficient human-to-human transmission. Others (Escherichia coli O157:H7, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease) depend on food as a vehicle of transmission. Diseases such as West Nile Fever and Rift Valley Fever that have spread to new geographical areas require a vector as part of the transmission cycle and are associated with low mortality, often in high-risk groups, such as the elderly, the immunocompromised, or persons with co-morbidity. Still others (Neisseria meningitidis W135, and the Ebola, Marburg, and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fevers) have strong geographical foci. Although outbreaks of Ebola haemorrhagic fever have been associated with case-fatality rates in the range of 53% (Uganda) to 88% (Democratic Republic of the Congo), person-to-person transmission requires close physical exposure to infected blood and other bodily fluids. Moreover, patients suffering from this disease during the period of high infectivity are visibly very ill and too unwell to travel.\n\nIn contrast, SARS is emerging in ways that suggest great potential for rapid international spread under the favourable conditions created by a highly mobile, closely interconnected world. Anecdotal data indicate an incubation period of 2 to 10 days (average 2 to 7 days), allowing the infectious agent to be transported, unsuspected and undetected, in a symptomless air traveller from one city in the world to any other city having an international airport. Person-to-person transmission through close contact with respiratory secretions has been demonstrated. The initial symptoms are non-specific and common. The concentration of cases in previously healthy hospital staff and the proportion of patients requiring intensive care are particularly alarming. This \u201c21st century\u201d disease could have other consequences as well. Should SARS continue to spread, the global economic consequences \u2013 alreadyestimated at around US$ 30 billion \u2013 could be great in a closely interconnected and interdependent world.\n\n Chronology of events leading to an unprecedented emergency travel advisory Severe Acute Pulmonary Syndrome (SARS) was first identified in Viet Nam on 28 February, 2003, when Dr Carlo Urbani, an epidemiologist from the Hanoi WHO office examined a patient with a severe form of pneumonia for which no etiology could be found. On 10 March 2003, 22 hospital workers in Hanoi French Hospital were ill with a similar acute respiratory syndrome, and by 11 March similar outbreaks had been reported among hospital workers in Hong Kong.\n\nSARS occurred at a time of heightened surveillance for atypical respiratory disease. From 10 February the WHO office in Beijing, which reinforced its staff with two epidemiologists, had been working with the government of China to learn more about an outbreak of atypical respiratory disease that affected health workers, their families and contacts in Guandong Province, with 305 cases and 5 deaths reported from 16 November 2002 to 7 February 2003. Around 30% of cases were reported to occur in health care workers. Surveillance was heightened further when a 33-year-old man who had travelled with his family to Fujian Province in China died in Hong Kong on 17 February. The next day, Hong Kong authorities announced that avian influenza A(H5N1) virus, the cause of \u201cbird flu\u201d, had been isolated from both the man and his nine-year-old hospitalized son. Another member of the family, an eight-year-old daughter, died while in Fujian and was buried there.\n\nOn 12 March, after an assessment of the situation in Asia with WHO teams in Hanoi, Hong Kong and Beijing, a global alert was issued about cases of severe atypical pneumonia with unknown etiology that appeared to place health workers at high risk.\n\nTwo days later, on 14 March, WHO received a report from the government of Canada that health authorities had taken steps to alert hospital workers, ambulance services, and public health units across the provinces that there were four cases of atypical pneumonia within a single family in Toronto that had resulted in 2 deaths. At 02h00 Geneva time on the following day, 15 March, the government of Singapore notified WHO, by urgent telecommunication, of a similar illness in a 32-year-old physician who had treated hospital workers with a severe respiratory syndrome in Singapore, including one from the French Hanoi hospital who had self-evacuated to Singapore. This Singapore physician had travelled to the United States for a medical conference, and at the end of the conference boarded a return flight to Singapore in New York. Before departure he had indicated to a colleague in Singapore by telephone that he had symptoms similar to the patients he had treated in Singapore. The colleague notified health authorities. WHO identified the airline and flight, and the physician and his accompanying family members were removed from the flight at a stopover in Frankfurt, Germany, where he was immediately isolated and placed under hospital care, as were his two accompanying family members when they developed fever and respiratory symptoms several days later. As a result of this prompt action, Germany experienced no further spread linked to the three imported cases.\n\nLater in the morning of 15 March, with this background and chronology of events, a decision was made by WHO to increase the level of the global alert issued on 12 March. The decision was based on five different but related factors. First, the etiology, and therefore the potential for continued spread, of this new disease were not yet known. Second, the outbreaks appeared to pose a great risk to health workers who managed patients, and to the family members and other close contacts of patients. Third, many different antibiotics and antivirals had been tried empirically and did not seem to have an effect. Fourth, though the numbers were initially small, a significant percentage of patients (25 of 26 hospital staff in Hanoi, and 24 of 39 hospital staff in Hong Kong) had rapidly progressed to respiratory failure, requiring intensive care and causing some deaths in previously healthy persons. Finally, the disease had moved out of its initial focus in Asia and appeared to have spread to North America and Europe.\n\nAt this time, the epidemiology of SARS was poorly understood. A virulent strain of influenza had not been ruled out as a possible cause, even though transmission patterns were not characteristic for influenza. There was also some hope that the new disease, like many other new diseases of the recent past, would fail to maintain efficient person-to-person transmission, or that it might attenuate with passage and eventually self-contain. Despite the lack of understanding about the disease, its cause, and future evolution, the need was great to introduce a series of emergency measures to contain SARS outbreaks in the affected areas and prevent further international spread, thus reducing opportunities for the new disease to establish endemicity. WHO thus decided, on 15 March, to issue a rare emergency travel advisory as a global alert to international travellers, health care professionals, and health authorities.\n\nThe global alert called for increased attention to patients with atypical pneumonia who fit the following case definition:\n\n\u2013 High fever (>38 C) \u2013 One or more respiratory symptoms including cough, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing AND One or more of the following: \u2013 Close contact with a person who has been diagnosed with SARS \u2013 Recent history of travel to areas reporting cases of SARS.\n\nAt the same time the global alert recommended no change in patterns of international travel, but that passengers notify their health authority if they should develop signs and symptoms as described above and have a history of travel to areas reporting cases of SARS. Following this alert, awareness increased immediately, and many potential new outbreaks were prevented by the prompt isolation and strict management of suspected cases.\n\nBy 27 March, however, it was evident that international spread of SARS had continued after the 15 March advisory at two of the earliest outbreak sites, namely Viet Nam and Hong Kong, and that persons on the same aeroplanes as persons with symptoms consistent with SARS, and sitting in close proximity to them, had developed signs and symptoms compatible with SARS. On this date it was decided to recommend new measures related to international travel, still with the intent of preventing the international spread of the infectious agent. These recommendations were that SARS-affected areas, where transmission was known to be occurring in chains of human-to-human transmission, institute measures to identify international passengers who had signs, symptoms and history compatible with SARS, and to recommend that such persons postpone international travel and seek medical advice. These recommendations were instituted in most of the affected areas shortly after 27 March\n\nHowever, concern continued to mount. An urgent investigation of the Amoy Gardens outbreak in Hong Kong began on 29 March, and the following day, health officials announced that 213 Amoy residents were probable cases of SARS. This followed an unusual cluster of cases, closely linked in time and place, among guests and visitors who had stayed on the same floor of a hotel located in the same district (Kowloon) as Amoy Gardens. By this same date, 9 business travellers and tourists had returned to Singapore, Beijing and Taiwan from Hong Kong, either sick or in the incubation period of SARS.\n\nOutbreaks in the hotel and housing estate indicated that SARS was showing an unusual pattern of transmission in Hong Kong, probably involving an environmental component, that would place persons at risk outside the confined health care settings associated with outbreaks in most other countries. The 9 cases of probable SARS that occurred in Singapore, Beijing, and Taiwan, and that were associated with travel in Hong Kong, indicated that the risk of international spread was continuing. Consultations were made with WHO teams and travel experts. On 2 April a recommendation for voluntary postponement of all but essential travel was issued for travellers considering travel to Hong Kong. At the same time, because the WHO team and government of China had confirmed that the 4-month long outbreak in Guangdong continued, and that cases fit the case definition being applied in Viet Nam and Hong Kong; and because transmission patterns in Guangdong were not yet available, these same recommendations were made for Guangdong as maximum security against spread of SARS outside of Guangdong in the absence of complete understanding of transmission patterns of the outbreak there.\n\nCases of possible transmission in aeroplanes continue to be reported and investigated. As recently as 5 April, notification of a SARS patient travelling internationally by sea from Hong Kong to Vladivostak (Russian Federation) was received, opening a possible second route of international travel for the virus.\n\nWHO travel recommendations are kept under constant review and will be amended as more data about the evolution of SARS become available.\n\n Lessons: the value of innovation and international collaboration The knowledge obtained in the three-week period since 15 March has been remarkable. It demonstrates the value of international cooperation on emerging infections and the importance of early detection and rapid introduction of emergency measures to prevent further international spread and help ensure that imported cases are not allowed to cause disease in others.\n\nWhen WHO began to set up emergency plans on 15 March, identification of the SARS causative agent and the development of a diagnostic test were given paramount importance in the overall containment strategy. Detection of the disease in its early stage, confirmation of cases, understanding modes of transmission, development of protocols for targeted treatment, vaccine research and development, and implementation of disease-specific preventive measures would all depend upon swift progress and results in etiological and diagnostic research. Sound public health measures would also require understanding of the presence and concentration of the pathogen in different tissues and secretions, and patterns of excretion throughout the course of illness and convalescence. So long as the aetiological agent remained unknown, specialists in infectious disease control would be forced to resort to control tools dating back to the \u201cMiddle Ages\u201d of microbiology: isolation and quarantine.\n\nOn 17 March, a network of 11 leading laboratories around the world was set up as a mechanism for expediting identification of the SARS causative agent. Laboratories were selected on the basis of three criteria: outstanding scientific expertise, facilities at biosafety level III, and capacity to contribute to the battery of tests and experiments that would be needed to fulfill Koch's four postulates for the identification of an infectious agent as the cause of a specific disease. The network was set up on the model of the influenza network and provides another important lesson: models and systems set up for one health emergency can be rapidly adapted to serve others.\n\nCollaboration is virtual. Members of the network confer in daily teleconferences coordinated by WHO, and use a secure web site to post electron microscopic pictures of candidate viruses, sequences of genetic material for virus identification and characterization, descriptions of experiments, and results. The well-guarded secret techniques that give each laboratory its competitive edge have been immediately and openly shared with others. Laboratories also quickly exchange various samples from patients and postmortem tissues. These arrangements have allowed the analysis of samples from the same patient simultaneously in several laboratories specialized in different approaches, with the results shared in real time. This collaboration has resulted in the identification of the suspected causative agent, and the development of three diagnostic tests, with unprecedented speed.\n\nVirus isolation continues from patients with SARS, and at the same time virus has been isolated from tears and faeces. Publications on these various findings are being prepared by members of this collaborating group, but the need remains for a highly sensitive and specific PCR test to diagnose acute infections.\n\nA similar collaborative group on epidemiology, made up of investigators from all sites with local transmission of SARS, continues to confirm person-to-person transmission as the major route of transmission. Today, the group exchanged information about the Hong Kong investigations to identify a possible environmental source, which might prove useful in understanding the unusual new cluster of cases in Singapore. Key questions include the exact points during the course of incubation and infection when transmission occurs and whether asymptotic cases are also capable of spreading SARS. These questions must be answered to better evaluate the extent of spread of SARS, and the success of containment activities.\n\nA third clinical group, which unites 80 clinicians from 13 countries having SARS cases, has consistently provided anecdotal information about the lack of efficacy of treatment with specific antibiotics and antivirals, and has begun to develop systematic clinical trials of Ribaviran at two sites. Their discussions have shed light on features of the disease at presentation, treatment and progression of the disease, prognostic indicators, and discharge criteria. No therapy has been shown to demonstrate any particular effectiveness. The clinicians agreed that a subset of SARS patients, perhaps 10%, decline, usually around day 7, and need mechanical assistance to breathe. The care of these people is often complicated by the presence of other diseases. In this group, mortality is high. Age over 40 years also appears to be associated with a more severe form of disease. Countries have made travel recommendations for their citizens, using the guidance provided by WHO and other considerations such as feasibility of medical evacuation of their citizens and their insurance coverage should they become infected.\n\nOn 28 March, at the end of the second week of the global response, China, an initially reluctant partner in the global alert and response at the start, became a full partner in the three working groups that were studying SARS, and concluded that the outbreaks of SARS elsewhere in Asia were related to the outbreak in Guangdong Province. The Chinese government has announced that SARS is being given top priority. A system of alert and response for all emerging and epidemic-prone diseases is being developed. Daily electronic reporting of new cases and deaths, by province, has begun. Equally important, health officials have begun daily televised press conferences, thus taking the important step of increasing the awareness of the population and hospital staff of the characteristic symptoms, the need to seek prompt medical attention, and the need to manage patients according to the principles of isolation and strict infection control.\n\nThe next weeks and months will tell whether the global alert and response will contain the current SARS outbreaks, preventing SARS from becoming yet another endemic infectious disease in human populations, or whether SARS will remain confined to its origins in nature, to re-emerge at yet another time and place. It is clear that the responsibility for containing the emergence of any new infectious disease showing international spread lies on all countries. In a world where all national borders are porous when confronted by a microbial threat, it is in the interest of all populations for countries to share the information they may have as soon as it is available. In so doing, they will allow both near and distant countries \u2013 all neighbours in our globalized world \u2013 to benefit from the understanding they have gained.",

        "Description of the Situation": "Status of SARS outbreaks in individual countries\n\n10 April 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported\n\nChina WHO is now planning to deepen discussions with health authorities in Beijing. This action follows concerns, connected with yesterday\u2019s report from a WHO investigative team, about SARS cases in Beijing and systems of case reporting and contact tracing.\n\nChina is today reporting 10 new SARS cases, with 2 new deaths, compared with yesterday.\n\nIn a separate development, two laboratories in China have announced detection of a coronavirus in specimens taken from SARS patients. The new virus, which is unlike any known human or animal virus in the coronavirus family, was isolated by a WHO virtual network of 11 laboratories set up to expedite identification of the etiological agent and development of a diagnostic test. Detection of the coronavirus adds further evidence that the outbreak that began in Guangdong Province in mid-November 2002 was caused by the SARS virus.\n\nHong Kong  Health authorities in Hong Kong have today announced that all household contacts of confirmed SARS patients will be required to confine themselves at home for up to 10 days with immediate effect. The new measure is intended to facilitate early detection and treatment of SARS cases and to reduce to the absolute minimum the risk of further spread. With a cumulative total of 998 cases and 28 deaths, Hong Kong ranks just below China in the severity of the SARS outbreak.\n\nHousehold contacts can choose between confinement in their homes and confinement in holiday camps. No visitors are allowed during the confinement period, and permission to leave homes or camps will be granted only on exceptional grounds.\n\nDuring the confinement period, the Hong Kong Department of Health will conduct medical checks to monitor health, and the police force will conduct compliance checks.\n\nOfficials in the Department of Health estimate that an initial 70 to 80 households, representing around 150 persons, will be subject to the new requirement.\n\nIn a separate development, ongoing investigations of the source of infection in the unusual cluster of cases in Amoy Gardens have failed to detect the virus in animals. The findings refute previous hypotheses that the SARS might have been spread by cockroaches or rodents, possibly through some common system serving vertically connected flats. Most Amoy Gardens cases have been residents in a single wing of a single building, Block E.\n\n Singapore In Singapore, particular concern has centered on a cluster of suspect and probable SARS cases first noted on 5 April in 21 staff at the Singapore General Hospital. Intensive investigation by WHO staff and Ministry of Health officials have traced most cases to a single Chinese man in his 60s was had been treated for chronic kidney disease and diabetes at another hospital (Tan Tock Hospital) from 5 to 20 March. The hospital subsequently experienced a cluster of 19 probable and 33 suspected SARS cases in staff, visitors, and inpatients. Most have been linked to the Chinese patient.\n\nThe second hospital-related cluster of SARS cases has now been linked to a decision to transfer all patients at Singapore General Hospital to two wards at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. It is strongly suspected that the second cluster arose from contact with the Chinese patient. The investigation is providing some reassurance about the cause of these cases, which increasingly appear to fit the known pattern of exposure during close contact with patients.\n\n Viet Nam  The number of cases in Viet Nam remains stable at 62. WHO staff and Ministry of Health officials anticipate that additional cases, associated with a case in a provincial hospital, may emerge in the next few days. However, vigilance is high, contact tracing is intense, and good infection control procedures are in place.\n\n Canada Health Canada has reported a cumulative total of 97 cases, with 10 deaths. The represents an increase of only 3 new cases for the second consecutive day. Ontario has reported 94 probable cases. All cases have occurred in persons who have travelled to Asia or had contact with SARS cases in the household or in a health-care setting. British Columbia has reported 3 probable cases.\n\n Malaysia: history of third probable case  WHO staff are collaborating with health authorities in Malaysia to conduct in-depth investigations, including history of recent travel and visits to health facilities, of the country\u2019s three probable SARS cases in an effort to prevent a wider outbreak. Two new cases were reported today. Investigation of the country\u2019s third case has revealed a history of travel to Beijing, China and Bangkok, Thailand. Onset of illness occurred in Bangkok. Upon return to Penang, Malaysia, the patient visited two private hospitals over a two-day period. Possible contacts are now being traced.\n\nActive contact tracing is a sound and essential public health measure for detecting persons who may have been exposed and alerting them to the steps to take should symptoms develop. Contact tracing can also establish whether all probable patients and suspect cases are linked together, through close face-to-face contact, and thus determine whether any instance of secondary transmission in the general community has occurred.\n\n Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 2781 cases and 111 deaths have been reported from 17 countries. Increases occurred in Brazil (1), Canada (3), China (10), Hong Kong SAR (28), Germany (1), Malaysia (2), Singapore (8), and the United States (5). Deaths were reported in China (2) and Hong Kong SAR (3).",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "Interim report of WHO team in China, status of the main SARS outbreaks in different countries\n\n9 April 2003  Disease Outbreak Reported China  The WHO team of experts presented its interim report on the SARS outbreak in Guangdong Province this morning to the Chinese Ministry of Health and Vice Premier Wu Yi in Beijing. The team began its investigations in Guangdong on 3 April.\n\nThe team concluded that the health system in Guangdong responded well to the outbreak. The province has a health system in which every hospital at every level reports any new cases of SARS. The WHO report therefore concluded that virtually all probable cases of SARS presenting at a hospital in Guangdong Province will be detected and rapidly reported.\n\nHowever, the team found an urgent need to improve surveillance in the countryside to head off new outbreaks in rural areas. The team was further concerned by an increase in sporadic cases, which could not be linked to a particular transmission chain, as such cases raised questions about the adequacy of contact tracing.\n\nIn addition, the report noted many remaining concerns about the ability of other provinces, where health systems are not as strong as the one in Guangdong, to respond promptly and effectively to the challenge of SARS.\n\nIn Beijing, for example, only a minority of hospitals make daily reports of SARS cases. Contact tracing is another problem in Beijing and does not appear to be carried out systematically. Failure to perform careful contact tracing will allow the disease to spread.\n\nThe team observed that many of China\u2019s poorer provinces may not have adequate resources, facilities, and equipment to cope with outbreaks of SARS, and underscored that Guangdong\u2019s capacity was exceptional among China\u2019s provinces.\n\nIn Guangdong, the SARS outbreak placed an enormous strain on the health care system. The Guangdong Infectious Disease Hospital (Guangzhou No. 8 People\u2019s Hospital) had 150 of its 400 beds occupied by SARS patients daily during the second week of February. The team noted that the response of the health care system has been exemplary, and commended the dedication and bravery of doctors, nurses, and others working in clinics and hospitals.\n\nMicrobiological findings   Large banks of stored specimens from suspected and probable SARS cases, from case contacts as well as from \u201cnormal controls\u201d exist at the institutions visited and are stored under suitable conditions; detailed information about the numbers and types of these specimens are available and were provided to members of the WHO team. Although the patient data on each of these is very limited, it is sufficient to allow linkage with the very detailed epidemiological and clinical informations held elsewhere in Guangdong Provincial Centers for Disease Control and the hospitals.\n\nThese specimen banks comprise different types of respiratory specimens from which the detection of agents can be attempted and serum samples, often as paired acute and convalescent sera (i.e. the first sample obtained during the acute phase of the illness and the second during recovery) which will allow determination of seroconversions. The laboratory staff agreed that once a causative agent for SARS was identified these banks should be tested and will provide very valuable information; they seemed, however, less sure whether this time had come already, i.e. whether there was already sufficient evidence and whether suitable tests had been developed elsewhere that would make such an exercise worthwhile. They requested assistance from the WHO team to obtain relevant information on primer sequences and other matters as well as access to suitable experimental tests such as immunofluorescence antibody assays.\n\nMain recommendations  The interim report made several major recommendations, including the following:   - The SARS reporting system established in Guangdong is an excellent model that all provinces should follow. Team members suggest that the MOH ensures that all provinces are brought up to Guangdong standards by implementing this system nationwide as a matter of the utmost urgency. A programme for evaluating and accrediting surveillance systems through evaluation by technical experts is also suggested in order to ensure that consistent standards are achieved and maintained.  - The Guangdong experience should be used to develop uniform standards throughout all provinces for preventing the spread of SARS in health care facilities.  - Careful contact tracing of SARS cases is vital to bring the outbreak under control. Detailed interviewing of all newly reported SARS cases by trained interviewers including a full review not only of close contacts but potential exposure in other crowded settings, e.g. public transport needs to be routinely carried out Contacts of cases should be provided with detailed preventive advice verbally and in writing.  - Much better collaboration between virological laboratories in China is required, particularly to facilitate the exchange of results, specimens and reagents. The following institutions should form the nucleus of a national SARS laboratory network within China: \u00a0\u00a0 \u00b7 National Institute of Virology, China CDC, Beijing\u00a0\u00a0 \u00b7 Virology Unit, Beijing Provincial CDC, Beijing \u00a0\u00a0 \u00b7 Virology Unit, Guangdong Provincial CDC, Guangzhou \u00a0\u00a0 \u00b7 Department of Virology, Zhongshan University, Guangzhou Laboratories from other areas with experience of SARS cases should also be included. Adequate funding and human resources need to be urgently provided to ensure the proper functioning and sustainability of SARS surveillance activities as they are essential to controlling spread of the disease. Chinese institutions should form a national SARS laboratory network within China to speed up the exchange of results, specimens and reagents.\n\n- Guangdong clinicians have cared for the largest number of patients in the world and their experience should be shared with the international community through publications, meetings and in drafting guidelines for the management of SARS patients.\n\nPriority actions  Priority actions recommended in the report to contain SARS include:  - early recognition and treatment of cases  - stringent infection control measures in hospitals and clinics  - prompt reporting of suspected cases   - meticulous investigation and contact tracing in the community - public awareness campaigns and education.\n\nHong Kong: heavy burden on the health system With today\u2019s cumulative total of 970 cases and 27 deaths, Hong Kong continues to have the largest SARS outbreak, second to China. The strain on health services and staff is considerable, and strengthened measures of infection control may be needed.\n\nThe isolation order placed on Block E, Amory Gardens will expire at midnight, April 9. The Hong Kong Health Department has announced that residents, temporarily housed at camps, may return home after their flats have been disinfected by the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department.\n\nSingapore: role of \u201csuper-spreaders\u201d   Singapore has increased measures to prevent transmission in hospitals following an outbreak in Singapore General Hospital. Measures include mandatory temperature checks for all staff, limiting visitors, and isolation of all possible SARS cases. The Singapore General Hospital outbreak involved over 20 people with suspect symptoms, nearly all nurses and doctors. Only seven have been diagnosed as \u201cprobable\u201d SARS cases. The distribution of cases over time suggests a point source. The health worker considered to be the index case in this cluster of cases may be the fourth \u201csuper-spreader\u201d identified in Singapore.\n\nA \u201csuper-spreader\u201d is a source case who has, for as yet unknown reasons, infected a large number of persons. Although transmission patterns of SARS remain incompletely understood, evidence suggests that such \u201csuper-spreaders\u201d may have contributed to the evolution of SARS outbreaks around the world.\n\nUntil recently, all cases in Singapore have had good epidemiological links to their source. Further work is now required to establish similar links for the more recent cases. If confirmed, such linking of cases will show that transmission is limited to those who are symptomatic, and usually very ill. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that health workers continue to be the main group diagnosed with SARS. To date, investigation of the SARS outbreak in Singapore have revealed few signs of community spread beyond family members in close face-to-face contact with patients. However, these findings are based on limited data on exposures.\n\nViet Nam: no asymptomatic transmission  Vietnam is now reporting a cumulative total of 62 cases. Four of these cases have been detected in the last few days following stable reporting of 58 cases for several consecutive days. The stable number of cases raised hope that the outbreak in the French hospital in Hanoi had been contained. However, a 59th case was reported on 31 March.\n\nThis male patient had been in contact with his daughter, who was a patient at the French Hospital at the time of Viet Nam\u2019s index case. This contact continued when the daughter became an outpatient. The daughter\u2019s husband, who attended the Hanoi French Hospital with his wife, had a mild febrile illness which was undiagnosed at the time and which resolved spontaneously. It is presumed that he had mild SARS and passed the infection to his father-in-law (case 59). Assuming this to be true, WHO epidemiologists maintain the view that asymptomatic transmission does not appear to occur. Nor does this case suggest a longer incubation period than currently assumed (2\u20137 days, with 10 days considered the rare maximum). Blood is being taken for testing of the husband. Case 60 is a doctor who cared for case 59 while he was in a provincial hospital about 1.5 hours from Hanoi. Cases 61 and 62 are young women who are part of the extended household who provided considerable care for case 59.\n\nWHO continues to work with the Ministry of Health to investigate the contacts of these cases. It is anticipated that a few more new cases will be linked to case 59. Careful monitoring of contacts continues.\n\nOf the 62 cases, 44 have been discharged, 4 have died and 14 remain in hospital. One of the hospitalized patients remains critically ill, although slightly improved. All other hospitalized patients are improving.\n\nCanada: one new probable case reported  Health Canada has reported a cumulative total of 94 probable cases and 10 deaths. Ontario has reported 91 probable cases. All cases have occurred in persons who have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS cases in the household or in a health-care setting. The remaining probable cases are in British Columbia (3).\n\nUpdate on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 2722 cases, with 106 deaths have been reported from 16 countries. This represents an increase of 51 cases and 3 deaths when compared with yesterday.\n\nNew cases were reported in Canada (3), China (1), Hong Kong SAR (42), Singapore (5), and the United States of America (1). The single case reported in Australia has been removed from the list. Deaths were reported in Hong Kong (2) and Singapore (1).",

        "Description of the Situation": "WHO Guangdong China team to issue its report\n\n8 April 2003  Disease Outbreak Reported \n\nThe WHO expert team in Guangdong Province, China will be issuing its official interim report and recommendations on the local SARS situation early tomorrow. The four-person team, headed by John MacKenzie of Australia, has been in Guangdong since Thursday 3 April. The team was charged to assess the local situation and to support the strengthening of surveillance, clinical management, infection control, and laboratory evaluation of SARS cases.\n\nThe team has visited Foshan City, where the earliest case is thought to have occurred in mid-November 2002, and Guangzhou City, the provincial capital. In a wide ranging collaborative investigation, the team has met with authorities, health and veterinary professionals, and technical experts in the provincial Centers for Disease Control laboratories and the virology laboratories of Zongshan Medical University. The team has conferred with staff at all levels and been granted full access to all sites, institutes, and hospitals requested.\n\nThe team will be reporting on the provincial surveillance system, measures for community infection control, patient management and hospital infection control. It will also give a detailed review of microbiological findings.\n\nThe SARS outbreak in Guangdong Province is presently the largest and oldest known outbreak of SARS and may hold important clues about both the origins or the virus and measures for clinical management. In one of its earliest reports about cases of atypical pneumonia to WHO, the Chinese Ministry of Health reported 305 cases and 5 deaths, from mid-November to 9 February, in 6 municipalities: Foshan, Guangzhou, Heyuan, Jiangmen, Shenzhen, and Zhongshan.\n\nGuangzhou was the home of a 64-year old professor of nephrology, at Zhongshan University, who is thought to be the index case who sparked the outbreak in Hong Kong. During late February, he stayed in room 911 on the ninth floor of the Metropole Hotel. Guests staying on the hotel\u2019s ninth floor sparked outbreaks in other countries when they returned to their homes in Toronto and Singapore. A 48-year-old American businessman, who also stayed on the 9th floor, is believed to have originated the outbreaks in Hanoi and in Hong Kong\u2019s Princess Margaret Hotel, where he was transferred. One local Hong Kong resident, who visited an acquaintance on the ninth floor, subsequently sparked an outbreak in a second Hong Kong hospital.\n\nElsewhere in China, Shanghai, which has reported its first SARS case, has requested a visit from the WHO team to discuss SARS and be advised on how best to deal with the disease.\n\nIn Beijing, the death on Sunday of a 53-year-old staff member of the International Labour Organization continued to cause considerable anxiety, particularly at embassies and among staff of international organizations. Epidemiologists at the WHO Office in Beijing have conducted contact tracing and other investigations to determine the source of the staff member\u2019s exposure and to assess whether close contacts may have been exposed. To date, no SARS cases or suspicious symptoms related to this death have been observed. The investigations are continuing.\n\nUpdate on cases and countries\n\nAs of today, 2671 SARS cases with 103 deaths have been reported from 17 countries. This represents an increase of 70 cases and 5 deaths when compared with yesterday. The new deaths were reported in Canada (1), Hong Kong SAR (2), and Singapore (2). The additional cases were reported in Canada (1), China (11), Hong Kong SAR (45), France (1), Singapore (7), and the United States (7). Taiwan, China removed 2 cases from the list.",

On 3 April, a total of 17 new cases, including two deaths, were reported. Two previously reported cases were excluded. Eleven new cases and one death occurred in Guangdong Province. One case was reported from Shanghai, four from Beijing, and one case (fatal) from Sichuan Province.\n\nOn April 4, 12 new cases, with no deaths, were reported, 11 from Guangdong and 1 from Shanxi. For April 5 and 6, 21 new cases and 2 new deaths were reported. The breakdown by province is awaiting translation from Chinese. This brings the total number of reported cases in China to 1268, with 53 deaths.\n\nChinese officials have announced that SARS is being made a high priority for the government. A system of alert and response for early detection and reporting of all emerging and epidemic-prone diseases is being put in place. The government has also begun holding daily press conferences. WHO welcomes this move, which is an important way to increase awareness of the population and health care staff of the characteristic symptoms, the need to seek prompt medical attention, and the need to manage patients according to the principles of isolation and strict infection control.\n\nThe WHO office in China has reported considerable anxiety among the international community following the death in Beijing on Sunday of a 53-year-old Finnish staff member of the International Labor Organization. The ILO staff members was in Beijing to attend an international conference. At present it is unclear how the staff member contracted SARS. He had travelled to Beijing via Thailand, where no local transmission has been reported.\n\nHong Kong  Hong Kong SAR continues to report the largest number of new cases, placing some hospitals under considerable strain. Today\u2019s report from the Department of Health indicates that the unusual outbreak among residents in the Amoy Gardens estate, which has caused 268 cases, is coming to an end. Investigation of environmental samples continues at a rapid pace with support from several government departments. Evidence that the causative agent is excreted in faeces has focused attention on the possibility of an oral-faecal route of transmission, though no conclusions have been reached. Good data from the investigations are expected by the end of the week. The investigations have found no evidence of airborne spread.\n\nSingapore  The Singapore Ministry of Health has reported an unusual cluster of 29 suspected SARS cases in hospital staff from two wards of a single hospital. Of these 4 are probable SARS cases. The onset of the clustering is believed to be 29 March. Officials investigating the cause of the outbreak are considering a possible point source in the environment, as it would be unusual for so many cases to begin on the same day if caused by contact with a patient\n\nViet Nam The outbreak in Viet Nam began at a French hospital in Hanoi, where the index case, a 48-year old Chinese-American businessman who worked for an import-export company in Hong Kong, was admitted on 26 February. The number of cases increased rapidly but then stabilized on 24 March at 58 cases and remained stable for 10 consecutive days. As the maximum incubation period for SARS is thought to be 10 days, the stable number of cases over this period raised hope that Viet Nam\u2019s outbreak had been brought under control. However, on 3 April a probable SARS case was detected in a provincial hospital. Though the case could be linked back to the French hospital, the absence of isolation and rigorous infection control at the provincial hospital suggests that many hospital staff, patients, and visitors could have been exposed, thus possibly seeding further waves of cases. An additional three probable cases have been reported over the past two days.\n\nCanada Health Canada has received reports of 217 probable or suspect cases of SARS. There have been 9 deaths in Canada. All Canadian cases have occurred in persons who have travelled to Asia or had contact with SARS cases in the household or in a health-care setting. The largest outbreak has occurred in Ontario, where 87 probable and 92 suspect cases have been reported. British Columbia is reporting 3 probable and 23 suspect cases, New Brunswick is reporting 2 suspect cases, Saskatchewan is reporting 1 suspect case, Alberta is reporting 5 suspect cases, and Prince Edward Island is reporting 4 suspect cases.\n\nThese reports account for the 90 probable cases included in the WHO cumulative table of cases and deaths for today.\n\nStatus of diagnostic tests The development of a diagnostic test, which is being pursued around the clock by the WHO collaborating network of 11 laboratories, has proved more problematic than hoped. Three diagnostic tests are now available and all have limitations as tools for bringing the SARS outbreak quickly under control.\n\nThe ELISA detects antibodies reliably but only from about day 20 after the onset of clinical symptoms. It therefore cannot be used to detect cases at an early stage before they have a chance to spread the infection to others. The second test, an immunofluorescence assay (IFA), detects antibodies reliably as of day 10 of infection, but is a demanding and comparatively slow test that requires the growth of virus in cell culture. The presently available PCR molecular test for detection of SARS virus genetic material is useful in the early stages of infection but produces many false-negatives, meaning that many persons who actually carry the virus may not be detected \u2013 creating a dangerous sense of false security for a virus that is known to spread easily in close person-to-person contact.\n\nUpdate on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 2601 cases of SARS, with 98 deaths, have been reported from 17 countries. This represents an increase of 85 cases and 9 deaths compared with the last update of 5 April. The deaths occurred in Canada (2), China (4), and Hong Kong SAR (3).\n\nThe single case reported in Belgium has been removed from the list.",

New cases have been associated with vertically linked apartments. \nA second line of investigation is concentrating on a burst sewage pipe in block E that may have epidemiological links with a visitor to Amoy Gardens which was subsequently admitted to Hong Kong\u2019s Prince of Wales Hospital in early March and was said to have been symptomatic at the time of his visit.",

        "Description of the Situation": "3 April 2003Disease Outbreak Reported\nSituation in China and Hong Kong SAR\n\nWHO team arrives in Guangdong Province The WHO team of experts arrived in Guangdong Province, China today and immediately started its work. The team was authorized to travel to the province yesterday.\n\nMeetings were held today with senior provincial health officials. The WHO team also listened to reports about the SARS outbreak, and held initial meetings with health workers at all levels. These workers, who have first-hand knowledge of the outbreak, include epidemiologists and clinicians treating SARS patients. Discussion focused on patterns of transmission, clinical profiles, and the suspected causative agent.\n\nChinese authorities had previously reported a cumulative total of 1153 cases and 40 deaths in Guangdong Province from 16 November, when the outbreak began, to the end of March, making this province the area most seriously affected by SARS to date.\n\nThe world\u2019s first recognized case of SARS occurred in Guangdong Province on 16 November. Expectations are high that important clues will emerge concerning the origins of SARS, which is thought to be caused by a new virus in the coronavirus family. The exact identity of the virus has proved elusive. Scientists, who confer daily in teleconferences organized by WHO, currently speculate that the SARS virus either jumped to humans from an animal species or mutated into a more virulent form.\n\nIn its continuing work, the WHO team is expected to visit Foshan city, where the first case of SARS was reported, and Guangzhou city. The team will also visit health care facilities, review case records, and hold further discussions before returning to Beijing early next week.\n\nIn Beijing, the government of China is now gearing up to fight SARS on a priority basis. Reports in today\u2019s media referred to a State Council executive meeting on SARS and described three key decisions.\n\nA special task force, headed by Minister of Health Dr Zhang Wenkang, will take charge of the fight against SARS. A vice secretary-general of the State Council will coordinate actions by relevant ministries.\nThe task force will provide updates on SARS to WHO.\nA nationwide mechanism for outbreak alert and response will be set up shortly to ensure rapid detection and reporting of outbreaks.\n\n\nDr Zhang appeared on Chinese national TV to address SARS-related issues.\n\nSituation in Hong Kong SAR The Department of Health in Hong Kong SAR reported 26 new cases today, compared with 23 yesterday. These figures represent a significant decline from the 155 cases reported on Tuesday and 60 reported on Monday. This trend suggests that the extraordinary control measures undertaken by the government are working. The Department of Health further announced that 89 SARS patients have been discharged from hospitals.\n\nUpdate on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 2270 SARS cases and 79 deaths have been reported from 16 countries. This represents an increase of 47 cases and 1 death (in Hong Kong) compared with yesterday.\n\nWith the addition of the first probable case in Brazil, SARS is now being reported on four continents.\n\nNew cases were reported in Canada (4), Hong Kong (26), Taiwan, China (1), France (2), Singapore (3), the United States of America (13), and Viet Nam (1). Brazil reported their first probable case. Two of Romania\u2019s three reported cases, one of the two cases in the Republic of Ireland, and the single case in Spain were removed from the list when determined to have other causes.",

        "Description of the Situation": "China deepens its collaboration to contain SARS, WHO revises its advice to international travellers as new data come in\n\n2 April 2003 \nDisease Outbreak Reported \n\nNew data from China, WHO team leaving immediately for Guangdong Chinese authorities have today announced updated figures for the number of cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and deaths in Guangdong Province. The figures, which cover the reporting period of 1 March to 31 March, are 361 new SARS cases and 9 deaths.\n\nChinese authorities had previously reported 792 cases and 31 deaths in Guangdong Province in the reporting period of 16 November 2002 to 28 February 2003. The cumulative total of SARS cases in Guangdong from 16 November to 31 March now stands at 1153 cases and 40 deaths.\n\nThe Chinese Ministry of Health has further announced that a five-person WHO team will be travelling immediately to Guangdong Province to confer with officials there. Chinese experience with the oldest SARS outbreak is expected to yield epidemiological and clinical clues useful in establishing policies to contain outbreaks elsewhere and prevent further international spread.\n\nMany questions about the outbreak in Guangdong Province, which borders Hong Kong, have yet to be answered. This outbreak is the largest reported to date and has also shown evidence of spread in the wider community.\n\nNo transmission of new cases is being reported elsewhere in the country. Chinese authorities are in the process of setting up a reporting system that will result in daily real-time reporting of SAS cases throughout the country.\n\nNew advice to travellers On the basis of new data from China and Hong Kong, WHO has today revised its advice to international travellers as a measure for preventing the further international spread of SARS.\n\nIn a press release this morning, WHO issued the following advice:\n\n\u201cThe World Health Organization (WHO) today began recommending that persons travelling to Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China and Guangdong Province, China consider postponing all but essential travel. This updated travel advice comes as a result of new developments in the multi-country outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).\u201d\n\nThe new travel advice is intended to limit further international spread of SARS by restricting travel to areas where the transmission patterns of SARS are not fully understood. The SARS situation, which is rapidly evolving, is under constant assessment by WHO in collaboration with three global networks of experts. The new advice is issued as part of a series of measures that will change as more information about SARS becomes available.\n\nNew data on international spread Overnight, WHO received reports on 9 persons, with a history of travel to Hong Kong dating from 15 March, who subsequently developed symptoms suggesting probable cases of SARS when they travelled to other countries. These 9 cases of probable SARS, related to travel in Hong Kong, occurred in Taiwan, Province of China, and Singapore. The data on these cases, and what is known about the incubation period of SARS, indicate that travel to Hong Kong can contribute to the international spread of SARS.\n\n15 March is the date when WHO issued its first SARS-related emergency travel advisory, which increased global awareness of this new disease, made travellers and health staff alert to symptoms, and initiated prompt reporting of cases.\n\nThe SARS outbreak in Hong Kong SAR has developed an unusual pattern of transmission. This pattern is different from what is being seen in the vast majority of other SARS outbreaks, and is not yet fully understood. The number of cases is continuing to increase significantly, and there is evidence that the disease has spread beyond the initial focus in hospitals.\n\nThese developments raise questions related to other routes of transmission, in addition to well-documented face-to-face exposure to droplets released when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Epidemiologists are considering whether SARS is being transmitted in Hong Kong by some environmental means for which no satisfactory explanation has been found.\n\nParticular concern centres on a large cluster of cases linked to residential buildings in the Amoy Garden housing estate in the Kowloon district of Hong Kong.\n\nHistorical perspective This is the first time in the history of WHO that such travel advice has been issued for specific geographical areas because of an outbreak of an infectious disease.\n\nSince 1958, WHO has issued weekly lists of areas infected with quarantinable diseases so that national authorities can decide whether to apply public health measures to arriving travellers. During the last years of the smallpox eradication campaign cases spread internationally by land. Controls at borders between neighbouring countries were relied on to prevent international spread. No global recommendations were necessary.",

        "Description of the Situation": "2 April 2003 \nDisease Outbreak Reported \nSARS outbreak:WHO investigation team moves to China, new travel advice announced [WHO PRESS RELEASE]\n\nPRESS RELEASE ISSUED BY WHO2 April 2003\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) today said that the Government of China had announced the WHO expert team currently in Beijing will travel to Guangdong Province to investigate the SARS outbreak there.\n\n\u201cThese are very positive steps taken today by China,\u201d said Dr David Heymann, Executive Director of Communicable Diseases at WHO. \u201cAs a result we\u2019ll be able to gather even more evidence about the nature of the SARS outbreak in China.\u201d\n\nIn addition, WHO began recommending that persons travelling to Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Guangdong Province, China consider postponing all but essential travel. This updated travel advice comes as a result of new developments, particularly in Hong Kong, in the multi-country outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).\n\nThis temporary recommendation will be reassessed daily as the epidemic evolves. The recommendation does not apply to passengers simply transiting through airports in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region or Guangdong Province, China.\n\nThe new travel advisory is intended to limit the spread of SARS by reducing travel to high risk areas. All other elements ofSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) WHO previous travel guidance still stand. See Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).\n\nThe SARS situation in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China has developed unique features. There is a continuing and significant increase in cases* with indications that SARS has spread beyond the initial focus in hospitals. These developments raise questions related to other possible routes of transmission of SARS. These may involve transport of the virus from one person to another via some type of environmental means. To date, no satisfactory explanation has been found regarding this possibility. Also, since March 19, nine travellers have been identified as SARS cases on returning from a visit to Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China.\n\nMany questions about the state of the outbreak in Guangdong Province, China which borders Hong Kong have yet to be answered. The Guangdong outbreak is the largest reported and has also shown evidence of spread in the wider community. New information provided today by provincial authorities of more than 300 new cases in March alone indicates the outbreak there continues.\n\nUnprecedented global cooperation helps advance knowledge and containment of SARS\n\nIn the four weeks that WHO has been tracking SARS much has been learned. This is largely because scientists, clinicians, laboratory chiefs and public health officials everywhere have collaborated closely.\n\nAs a result of WHO's global alert issued on 15 March, national authorities have implemented heightened surveillance for cases of SARS. While an increasing number of countries are reporting new cases, these cases are quickly identified, patients are isolated and local transmission is stopped in most countries.\n\nIt is now known that infection control methods work to contain the spread of SARS in hospitals, even in countries which do not have the most modern equipment.\n\nWHO and a network of 11 of the world's top laboratories are zeroing in on the cause of SARS and a diagnostic test is being developed. This test will help distinguish between those who are infected and those who are free of the SARS virus.\n\nThe laboratory network is continuing its investigations. So far, the agent causing SARS has not been fully characterized and there is no certain treatment, vaccine or known other preventative measure.\n\n\"There will be other new diseases that will emerge in the future, and we will respond just as we have with SARS \u2014 with maximum efforts to contain its spread,\" stated Dr Gu\u00e9na\u00ebl Rodier, Director, Communicable Disease Surveillance and Response, WHO.\n\n* Cases of SARS and the countries in which they appear are posted on the WHO web site every evening in Geneva.",

        "Description of the Situation": "Disease Outbreak Reported \n31 March 2003 \nSituation in Hong Kong, activities of WHO team in China\n\nSituation in Hong Kong The Hong Kong Department of Health has today issued an unprecedented isolation order to prevent the further spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The isolation order requires residents of Block E of Amoy Garden to remain in their flats until midnight on 9 April.\n\nThe decision to issue the isolation order was made following a continued steep rise in the number of SARS cases detected in the building over the past few days. Concern about a possible outbreak in Amoy Garden mounted on Saturday, when 22 of Hong Kong\u2019s 45 new SAR cases hospitalized that day were determined to be residents of the estate. On Sunday, 36 of the 60 new patients admitted to hospital with probable SARS were Amoy Garden residents.\n\nHong Kong health authorities today informed the public that a cumulative total of 213 residents of Amoy Garden had been admitted to hospital with suspected SARS since reporting on the disease began. Hong Kong\u2019s outbreak began on 12 March when health officials first recognized a cluster of cases of atypical pneumonia in the Prince of Wales Hospital.\n\nOf the 213 Amoy residents affected in the outbreak, 107 patients resided in Block E. In addition, most of these 107 patients from Block E lived in flats that were vertically arranged.\n\nThis suggests that SARS may be spreading in Hong Kong according to a different pattern, still involving close person-to-person contact with bodily secretions from an infected person. WHO epidemiologists are considering the possibility that bodily secretions containing the causative virus might somehow enter common systems that link rooms or flats together. This pattern of spread would be in addition to the well-documented face-to-face contact that has been seen in the majority of cases reported so far.\n\nEarlier this month, Hong Kong epidemiologists detected an unusual pattern of transmission among guests and visitors at the Metropole Hotel during the critical period of 15 to 23 February. Guests and visitors at a single floor of the hotel are thought to have spread SARS to Toronto and Singapore and to have started the outbreak in Hong Kong\u2019s Prince of Wales Hospital. No staff at the hotel developed symptoms.\n\nAmoy Garden is a large housing estate consisting of ten 35-storey blocks, where around 15,000 persons reside. It is located in Kowloon District.\n\nWHO has been informed that environmental samples have been taken from the affected flats in Block E and that investigations are under way to determine a possible explanation for this apparent vertical spread of the disease.\n\nAlthough the investigation is complex, results from testing of the environmental samples should be available within days and will help determine the source of infection in Block E and the mechanisms by which the pathogen has spread.\n\nHong Kong epidemiologists have identified a possible \u201cindex\u201d case in the Amoy Garden outbreak. This is a patient, now hospitalized in Prince of Wales Hospital, who visited his brother, a resident of Block E, several times before hospital admission.\n\nThe WHO team in China The expert team spent the day in the Beijing Municipality Center for Disease Control and Prevention reviewing case records for all 10 cases reported in Beijing Municipality. Following the cases in Guangdong province in late January and early February 2003, Beijing Municipality CDC officials said an enhanced local surveillance system was established by adding 11 sentinel hospitals (out of 50 total hospitals) to report cases of atypical pneumonia.\n\nThe laboratory service was also geared up to receive specimens and carry out tests in secure conditions. Other preparation included stockpiling of drugs, setting up a public hotline and holding two news conferences. In addition, CDC and hospital staff were trained in prompt reporting of atypical pneumonia and infection control. An isolation unit was established. CDC Beijing said that antibiotics and Ribovirin are being used routinely as treatment and prophylaxis.\n\nThe team were told that contact tracing had begun as soon as the first cases of atypical pneumonia had been recognized in Beijing and had been carried out for all subsequent cases. Eight of the cases were imported (from Hong Kong and Taiyuan city, Shanxi province) and two were health care workers who became infected trying to revive a 72 year old man believed to have become ill after visiting a relative with SARS in a Hong Kong hospital. Besides the two health care workers, no other cases have been infected in Beijing.\n\nDiscussions concerning a visit by the expert team to Guangdong Province are continuing with the Ministry of Health.\n\nUpdate on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 1622 cases, with 58 deaths, have been reported from 13 countries. This represents an increase of 72 cases and 4 deaths since the last figures were compiled on Saturday.\n\nThe greatest increase in cases occurred in Hong Kong SAR.

        "Description of the Situation": "China joins WHO collaborative network\n\nDisease Outbreak Reported  28 March 2003\n\nAt a press briefing held today in Beijing, the head of the WHO investigative team in China, John MacKenzie of Australia, announced several steps forward in the government\u2019s commitment to join international efforts to contain a newly emerging infectious disease. (see Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Press briefing, Beijing, China)\n\nThe WHO team of five experts arrived in Beijing last Sunday to investigate an outbreak of atypical pneumonia that began in Guangdong Province on 16 November 2002.\n\nExperts have strongly suspected a link between the southern China outbreak and current cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that first surfaced in mid-February in Asia. The disease has since spread to 13 countries on three continents.\n\nThe WHO investigation is being conducted in collaboration with the Chinese Ministry of Health, the Chinese Centers for Disease Control, and officials from Guangdong Province.\n\nIn the initial stage of the investigation, the WHO team compared case definitions used in China with those used by WHO to identify SARS and concluded that most cases of atypical pneumonia reported in China from mid-November until 28 February were \u201cindeed cases of SARS.\u201d\n\nAs reported by the WHO team, Chinese authorities have now agreed to join the WHO collaborative effort to contain the SARS outbreak and prevent its further international spread. Chinese institutes will be selected within days to participate in three global electronic networks set up by WHO to facilitate rapid international collaboration on SARS-related scientific and medical problems. Networks of experts are working to further identify and characterize the SARS virus, develop better tools for diagnosis and management, and understand how the disease is transmitted and what works best to prevent its spread.\n\nWHO authorities have also been given access to meticulous records kept on Chinese SARS cases. As China, according to statistics released earlier this week, has experienced the largest number of SARS cases of any country in the world, these data are expected to take understanding of the new disease, and particularly its origins, a major step forward.\n\nOne of the greatest challenges in containing new diseases is the lack of understanding of their behaviour as they emerge. The Chinese data, which also cover the longest time frame, are further expected to improve understanding of how the disease spreads from person to person and why some outbreaks appear to have much milder cases than others.\n\nProgress in identifying the causative agent, now being reported by members in a WHO global network of collaborating laboratories, indicates that the causative agent is a new virus in humans that may have jumped the species barrier from its animal host or mutated in ways that have given it more lethal properties. Chinese data may help solve the riddle of how the new virus first began to cause disease in humans.\n\nChina released new figures on the Guangdong outbreak on Wednesday, significantly increasing the global cumulative total. On Thursday, officials issued the first reports of cases and deaths in ongoing outbreaks in Beijing province and in the northern province of Shanxi.\n\nChina has further agreed today to begin providing up-to-date electronic reports of SARS cases throughout China. These reports will be submitted electronically as official reports to WHO from the Ministry of Health.\n\nAccording to members of the WHO team in China, the government may need a few days to get the new nationwide system of daily electronic reports in operation.\n\nUpdate on cases and countries  As of today, a cumulative total of 1485 cases and 53 deaths have been reported from 13 countries. This represents an increase of 77 cases. No new deaths have occurred.\n\nNo reports were received from China today due to the decision to introduce a new system of nationwide daily electronic reporting to WHO.\n\nWith 58 new cases, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China remains the most severely affected area. Other countries reporting new cases include Canada (1), China, Taiwan (4), Singapore (8), and the United States of America (6).\n\nViet Nam reported no new cases and no new deaths for the fifth day in a row. WHO experts believe that rapid detection of the outbreak and immediate introduction of stringent infection control procedures may have held further transmission at bay.\n\nSome patients recovering  To date, 19 SARS patients have been discharged from hospitals in Hong Kong, 17 from Viet Nam, and 25 from Singapore.",

        "Description of the Situation": "Disease Outbreak Reported  27 March 2003\nSARS virus close to conclusive identification, new tests for rapid diagnosis ready soon\n\nOn 17 March, WHO established a global network of leading laboratories to collaborate in the identification of the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).\n\nEarly on, labs in the network narrowed the search to members of the paramyxovirus and coronavirus families. Findings shared by network labs earlier this week began pointing, with increasing consistency, to coronaviruses.\n\n\u201cData from many network laboratories indicate that a coronavirus is the primary cause of the disease,\u201d said WHO virologist and epidemiologist Klaus St\u00f6hr. \u201cThis virus is unlike any known human or animal member of this virus family. It is consistently found in specimens from SARS patients from many countries. It has been isolated in cell-culture. We are very close to knowing for sure.\u201d\n\nConclusive identification of a causative must meet all criteria in the so-called \u201cKoch\u2019s postulate.\u201d The additional experiments needed to fulfil these criteria are currently under way at a laboratory in the Netherlands.\n\nScientists at Hong Kong University had previously announced, on 21 March, the isolation of a new virus that was strongly suspected to be the causative agent of SARS. The virus was detected in cell culture and by electron microscopy. The identity of the virus was not known at the time.\n\nEarlier this week, researchers at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) produced strong evidence implicating a coronavirus as the agent that causes SARS. Many labs of the WHO network have since been using molecular tests provided by CDC to confirm the presence of a coronavirus in specimens from patients in various countries.\n\nRapid progress was also facilitated by the sharing of samples, taken from SARS patients in areas with large numbers of confirmed cases, among participants in the laboratory.\n\nHong Kong, with 367 patients, many of whom are in intensive care, and 10 deaths remains the most severely affected area.\n\nSequencing of the virus is ongoing in four laboratories. Results will help classify the virus and refine molecular diagnostic tools. Results will also guide the development of specific interventions.\n\nAt present, no treatment beyond good intensive and supportive care has been consistently shown to improve prognosis in persons with SARS.\n\nScientists in the network suspect that the virus will prove to be an entirely new, or until now undetected, member of the coronavirus family.\n\nProgress in the development of a diagnostic test Efforts to develop a reliable and easy to use diagnostic test are also moving forward quickly. Hong Kong University, Chinese University, and Public Virus Labs, all located in Hong Kong and all members of the WHO network, have devised a basic diagnostic test. In studies using confirmed SARS patients and healthy controls, results to date have been consistently positive in confirmed cases and consistently negative in the healthy controls. Further testing will begin tomorrow.\n\nThe Hong Kong diagnostic test is a molecular test based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology. Hong Kong scientists have also developed a diagnostic tool using the immunofluorescence assay (IFA) technique. Validation of the test is being facilitated by gene sequences of the PCR primers electronically by laboratories collaborating in the network. The WHO network is offering to make these test materials immediately available to labs in other countries throughout the world\n\nOver the next few days, samples from hundreds of confirmed and suspected SARS cases will be tested using these new diagnostic tools. In so doing, the tools will be further refined and streamlined to upgrade their capacity for daily screening of large numbers of samples.\n\nThe PCR test is already showing good reliability in detecting SARS cases in the early days of infection. The IFA test is being used to detect infection in convalescent sera at about three weeks after infection begins. Together, the two tests should help to quickly and safely reassure the many patients the world over who are concerned about suspicious symptoms and yet may be suffering from common illnesses safely treated at home.\n\nProcedures of isolation and strict barrier nursing, recommended by WHO for the management of suspected SARS cases, have placed a heavy burden on health care services in several affected areas.\n\nUpdate on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 1408 cases and 53 deaths have been reported from 13 countries. Romania is reporting its first 3 probable cases today. This represents an increase of 85 cases and 4 deaths compared with the previous day.\n\nNew data from China The Chinese Ministry of Health has today officially reported 792 cases and 31 deaths, up to 28 February, in Guangdong Province. Approximately 30% of these cases occurred in health workers.\n\nThe Chinese Ministry of Health has further reported on SARS cases in other parts of China. In Beijing, 10 cases and 3 deaths have occurred as of 26 March. Two of these cases are in health workers. In the northern province of Shanxi, four cases, with no deaths, have occurred as of 26 March. Two cases are in health workers.",

        "Description of the Situation": "Disease Outbreak Reported\n\n26 March 2003\nData from China, countries introduce stringent control measures\n\nChina updates data on cases and deaths Chinese authorities have today officially reported a total of 792 cases and 31 deaths in an outbreak of atypical pneumonia that began in southern China, in Guangdong Province on 16 November 2002. Cases were reported to have occurred in 7 cities of Guangdong Province.\n\nChinese authorities had previously reported to WHO, on 14 February, a total of 305 cases and 5 deaths from 16 November to 9 February 2003.\n\nThe new figures cover the period of 16 November to 28 February.\n\nA WHO team of 5 international experts, which arrived in China on the weekend, has today reviewed the case definition used in reporting cases of atypical pneumonia in Guangdong Province. The WHO team compared this definition with the WHO definition used to identify probable cases of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and concluded that the two definitions are compatible.\n\nFollowing in-depth discussion with central-level authorities and health officials in Guangdong Province on the details of several clusters of cases, the WHO expert team reached the conclusion that the atypical pneumonia cases which began occurring in southern China in November 2002 are likely cases of the same disease, now referred to as SARS, that began appearing in other Asian countries on 26 February and has since spread widely to several cities throughout the world.\n\nChinese authorities further informed the WHO team of a new reporting system that will rely on regular provincial updates. WHO is expecting further information on reported cases in China for March as these data become available.\n\nCase management guidelines being used in China are in line with WHO recommendations for minimizing further transmission.\n\nChina is also beginning a collaborative programme in which sera from infected Chinese patients will be exchanged with the WHO network of collaborating laboratories who are working to identify the SARS causative agent.\n\nUpdate on reported cases The new data from China bring the total number of reported probable cases worldwide, dating back to 16 November, to 1323 cases and 49 deaths. When the data from China are excluded, today\u2019s figures represent an increase of 41 cases, largely concentrated in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, and one death, in Singapore, compared with yesterday. Full details are available on the WHO web site.Cumulative Number of Reported Cases (SARS).\n\nNational measures to contain further spread Several countries are introducing maximum measures, including quarantine, to prevent the further spread of SARS.\n\nNew diseases such as SARS are poorly understood as they emerge. At the beginning of an outbreak, it is sound public health policy to institute maximum control measures needed to prevent further spread.\n\nMaximum measures are justified when, in the view of national health authorities, they can be expected to protect populations against infection, keep the disease from spreading into the general population, and help prevent international spread to other countries, particularly through air travel.\n\nAs the epidemiology of SARS becomes more fully understood, such measures can be adjusted and reduced in line with what is known about how the disease is transmitted and what works best to stop its spread, both nationally and internationally.\n\nFirst clinical \u201cgrand rounds\u201d on SARS held today The first global \u201cgrand rounds\u201d on SARS clinical features and treatment were held today by WHO. The electronic meeting united 80 clinicians from 13 countries. A summary of their discussions and conclusions has been posted today at the WHO web site.Clinicians hold virtual conference on management of SARS patients.\n\nProgress towards identification of the virus Research attention is increasingly focusing on the Coronavirus family, though viruses from the Paramyxovirus and other families are also being considered as scientists cast the widest possible net in their search for the cause of SARS. Many are of the opinion that a diagnostic test could rapidly follow conclusive identification of the pathogen. Experts in the network are also considering the theory that SARS is caused by co-infection with two new viruses that somehow need each other in order to cause severe disease in humans. Evidence is strongly pointing to a new virus, or possibly two new viruses, that have not previously been known to infect humans or cause severe disease.\n\nHypotheses include a virus known to cause disease in an animal host that has jumped the species barrier to infect humans, or a known human virus that has mutated to acquire properties that are causing much more severe disease in humans. It is increasingly certain, however, that SARS is a serious new disease caused by a newly recognized pathogen.",

        "Description of the Situation": "Disease Outbreak Reported \n25 March 2003 \nUpdated travel advice\n\nOn 15 March, WHO issued a travel advisory in response to the growing international threat posed by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Since then, WHO has conducted daily teleconferences with health authorities and WHO team members on the scene in all areas affected by SARS.\n\nWHO also receives detailed bulletins from ministries of health in the most heavily affected areas reporting on any SARS-related events that might alter understanding of the behaviour of this new disease.\n\nToday\u2019s communications included a report, from the Hong Kong department of health, providing detailed preliminary data on the detection of nine atypical pneumonia cases among members of a Beijing tour organized by a Hong Kong travel agent. Investigation of these cases, including tentative identification of the index case, has progressed rapidly. The Hong Kong department of health is tracing, for surveillance purposes, the crew members and passengers who had taken two flights. The general public has been informed and a hot-line has been set up.\n\nWHO epidemiologists in Geneva, together with experts tracking outbreaks in affected countries, have decided today that, based on the information available at present, there is no need to change previous WHO advice.\n\nWHO continues to recommend no travel restrictions to any destination. WHO advises travellers to remain alert to the symptoms of SARS. These include high fever, respiratory symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath, and difficulty breathing, and should report these symptoms promptly.\n\nAs of today, 487 SARS cases have been reported from 12 countries.\n\nA number of persons with SARS have taken long distance flights after becoming ill. Thousands of passengers who travelled in the same flights have been traced in Germany, Canada, Singapore and the United States. No cases have been discovered among these contacts. Today's report of a possible transmission of SARS on board a flight is undergoing investigation. As \u201cclose\u201d contact is possible during a flight, in passengers sitting close to an infected person, such transmission cannot be ruled out. The evidence to date indicates that in-flight transmission is very unusual.\n\nHealth authorities and hospital staff the world over are now alert to the symptoms of SARS. Suspect cases are being quickly detected and promptly reported. Proper isolation and management of cases has greatly reduced the risk of transmission of newly detected cases to others.\n\nWHO advice to travellers is being kept under constant review. SARS is an emerging disease. Knowledge about is clinical behaviour, response to treatment, and modes and risks of transmission are continually evolving.\n\nWHO is confident that, in the present climate of heightened awareness and rapid and detailed reporting, data useful in understanding SARS and issuing sound public health advice are being rapidly collected and rapidly made available.",

        "Description of the Situation": "Disease Outbreak Reported\n\n24 March 2003\nAdvice to travellers, situation update\n\nTravel advice Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) was first recognized as a new disease in Asia in mid-February. Since then, more than 450 cases, with 17 deaths, have been reported from 13 countries on three continents.\n\nOn 15 March, WHO issued an emergency travel advisory, based on information available at that time, and a preliminary case definition of SARS. The travel advisory was intended to alert national authorities and clinicians to potential cases of SARS and to urge travellers, including airline crew, with symptoms suggestive of SARS to seek medical attention.\n\nWHO continues to recommend, on the basis of currently available data, no travel restrictions to any destination. Guidance to governments, airlines, physicians and travellers issued on 15 March remains valid. WHO issues emergency travel advisory.\n\nAdvice for health authorities and clinicians A more detailed clinical picture of SARS has been posted at the WHO Web site: Preliminary Clinical Description of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. \n\nWHO has further recommended that suspect cases be placed in isolation and managed using strict barrier nursing practices: Management of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)\n\nDrawing on partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, WHO and its partner institutes and collaborating centres have placed field teams in Hanoi, Viet Nam, Hong Kong SAR, and Taiwan, China to assist health authorities. Last week, WHO flew 300 kilos of protective equipment and medical supplies to Hanoi.\n\nHealth authorities and hospital staff the world over are now alert to the symptoms of SARS. Suspect cases are being quickly detected and promptly reported. Proper isolation and management of cases has greatly reduced the risk of transmission of newly detected cases to others.\n\nAs of data available today, the vast majority of cases continue to occur in health care workers managing patients in hospital environments, and in the families and other close contacts of patients. Cumulative total of reported cases, 24 March.\n\nUpdate on cases and countries affected Reports from health authorities in 13 countries, compiled today, indicate a cumulative total of 456 cases of SARS and 17 deaths. This compares with reports a week ago (17 March) of 150 cases in 7 countries.Cumulative total of reported cases, 24 March.\n\nFor most of the affected countries, cases reported today are for probable cases. Previous reports included both probable and suspected cases. As case definitions of SARS differ in some countries, the United States of America is today reporting 37 suspect cases under investigation.\n\nHong Kong Special Administrative Region of China remains the most severely affected area, reporting 260 cases and 10 deaths. Other severely affected areas included Singapore, with 65 cases and no deaths, and Vietnam, with 58 cases and 4 deaths. Canada has reported 11 cases and 3 deaths.\n\nChest X-rays showing distinctive features of SARS are presently the main tool for distinguishing suspected from probable cases. A \u201chand-made\u201d diagnostic test, developed by Hong Kong scientists, began producing reliable results on Saturday and will be made available to key laboratories in a matter of days. A more sophisticated test is expected to be available for widespread use in diagnosing SARS cases within weeks.\n\nWork towards the definitive identification of the causative agent, now strongly expected to be a virus of the Paramyxovirus or Coronavirus families, is continuing at breakneck speed. Researchers in a network of 11 leading laboratories, set up on Monday 17 March, exchange data on a restricted web site and compare virological and clinical information during daily teleconferences.\n\nA second network of clinicians was set up on 20 March to expedite work on diagnosis and treatment.\n\nWHO team of experts in China A WHO international team of experts in epidemiology, microbiology, virology, and respiratory diseases arrived in Beijing, China on Sunday 23 March. The multinational team was assembled in response to a request from the Chinese Ministry of Health to investigate possible links between the current SARS outbreak, which began in Asia in mid-February, and an outbreak of atypical pneumonia which began in Guangdong Province in China in mid-November.\n\nThe WHO team, which includes experts from 5 countries, will review available epidemiological and laboratory data on cases in the southern China outbreak. It will also propose what additional investigations should be carried out, and which additional reagents, antibodies, tests, equipment and expertise might be required to continue the laboratory and virological work. This additional expertise and equipment is expected to bolster efforts to trace the source of atypical pneumonia in Guangdong Province.\n\nConcern over international spread The first concern WHO has regarding travel is the possibility that the disease will spread rapidly and become established in many countries around the world. The extent to which this is happening is being monitored by heightened surveillance for SARS symptoms around the world and rapid reporting of suspected cases.\n\nThe worldwide awareness of the disease has been demonstrated by the number of countries reporting to WHO. Recommended isolation procedures appear to be working. Since these measures were introduced, no onward transmission of the disease, beyond those initially identified, has been reported.\n\nIn these circumstances, where the rapid identification and isolation of cases appears to be containing international spread, WHO does not consider that any additional restrictions on travel or trade are required.\n\nConcerns over travel to affected areasAs countries around the world have increased surveillance activities they have discovered a small number of cases in persons who have traveled to the affected areas. The small number of such cases, at present, is an indication that SARS poses little risk to travellers visiting the affected areas.\n\nBased on available information, WHO does not consider that the small health risk attributable to SARS significantly increases the health risk associated with travel to any destination. WHO therefore maintains its advice that no SARS-related restrictions on travel to any destination are necessary.\n\nWHO is aware that a number of countries have advised their nationals to consider postponing unnecessary or elective travel to the areas where local transmission of the disease has been demonstrated. Such advice does not amount to a restriction of travel, and is the responsibility of the concerned national authorities.\n\n\n\nConcern about air travelThe public is also concerned about the safety of air travel. Cases that have been identified in countries outside the initially affected areas have arrived by air transport.\n\nIt is important to note that there is no evidence to date to indicate that the disease is transmitted during air travel, or that travelling in an aeroplane with an infected person has resulted in illness to other passengers or crew. In case of concern that passengers have been exposed to an infected person during a flight, a protocol exists for the follow up of passengers and crew. When an airline wishes to disinfect an aeroplane after carrying a suspected SARS case there is good reason to believe that the procedures described in the WHO Guide to Hygiene and Sanitation in Aviation will be fully effective.",

        "Description of the Situation": "Disease Outbreak Reported\n\n22 March 2003\nSARS virus isolated, new diagnostic test producing reliable results\n\nA team of scientists in the department of microbiology, University of Hong Kong, has announced today success in culturing the viral agent that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Further progress in the development of a reliable diagnostic test was simultaneously announced by the same team.\n\nUsing a special cell line, the Hong Kong scientists isolated the virus from the lung tissue of a patient who developed pneumonia following contact with a professor from Guangdong Province in southern China. Both the professor and the contact have died.\n\nIsolation of the virus now lays the solid foundation for very rapid development of a diagnostic test.\n\nThe Hong Kong scientists have devised a basic test, relying on the technique of neutralizing antibodies. In today\u2019s experiments designed to determine the accuracy of the test, scientists found that it was able to detect tell-tale antibodies in sera taken from eight SARS patients. The consistency of these findings indicates that the test is reliably identifying cases of SARS infection.\n\nThis \u201chand-made\u201d test will now be further developed into a more sophisticated diagnostic test. A rapid and reliable diagnostic test for SARS is urgently needed to assist the many clinicians who need a tool for rapid confirmation of genuine cases. Such a test can also help reassure the many \u201cworried well\u201d who are flooding health facilities as international concern about this disease and its rapid spread to new areas continues to increase.\n\nMany common and usually self-healing illnesses mimic the symptoms of SARS in its early stage.\n\nWith the virus now isolated, scientists in Hong Kong and elsewhere can move forward quickly to characterize the agent, determine its relationship with known viruses, and establish a definitive identity. Results will be shared among 11 leading laboratories in a network set up on Monday 17 March by WHO.\n\nExceptionally rapid progress Close collaboration, with findings shared daily in teleconferences and by email, has allowed advances that normally need months to take place in a matter of days.\n\n\u201cThis spectacular achievement is an example of what the world can do when the intellectual resources of nations around the world are focused on a single problem,\u201d says Klaus St\u00f6hr, a WHO virologist who is coordinating the global laboratory network.\n\n\u201cScientists who are by default academic competitors are now working virtually shoulder to shoulder. In less than a week, they have produced results which, in other circumstances, would likely have taken months or more. This rapid advance is fuelling the hope that SARS can and will be contained.\u201d The virus responsible for SARS is considered by some research groups to be a member of the well-known Paramyxoviridae family. Yesterday, Canadian researchers released findings suggesting that the metapneumovirus, which belongs to this family, may be the cause.\n\nThe metapneumovirus was first discovered by Dutch scientists in June 2001 at a laboratory that is also included in the new WHO network. At the time of its discovery, the virus was known to cause respiratory disease in humans, including some cases of pneumonia, but showed a different transmission pattern and was much less severe than the SARS agent.\n\nAt this point, it cannot be ruled out that an entirely different virus from another family may be responsible for the SARS outbreak.\n\nIdentity of virus remains elusive WHO cautions that the race to identify the SARS causative agent is by no means over. Although the virus has now been isolated, its identity remains elusive. Other research groups in the network of collaborating labs are producing hints that the causative agent may belong to another virus family.\n\nSARS is an emerging disease, first recognized in Asia in mid-February, that has sickened over 380 persons on three continents and caused severe pneumonia in a large proportion of patients. A cumulative list of affected countries and numbers of cases and deaths is released each day on the WHO web site. Today\u2019s data indicate that the vast majority of reported cases continue to occur in health care workers, family members and close contacts of patients. \n\nInvestigative team travelling to China A WHO team of five experts is now en route to China to investigate the possibility that an outbreak of a disease having similar symptoms and affecting similar groups \u2013 health care workers and close contacts of patients \u2013 may be linked to the current SARS outbreak.\n\nAs of today, Hong Kong remains the most seriously affected area. Authorities there have reported a total of 222 cases in health care workers, medical students, and family members and hospital visitors who have been in close contact with patients. Of these, 217 have developed symptoms of pneumonia, and many are in serious condition.",

        "Description of the Situation": "Disease Outbreak Reported\n\n21 March 2003\nMajor step forward towards development of diagnostic test\n\nA laboratory in a new network set up on Monday 17 March has today succeeded in growing, in cell culture, an infectious agent that might be the cause of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).\n\nThis major step towards the development of a diagnostic test has occurred despite the failure, up to now, to pinpoint the exact identity of the causative agent.\n\nResearchers at the laboratory took serum samples from the blood of recovering SARS patients and a matching number of healthy volunteers in what is known as a \u201cblinded\u201d test.\n\nSerum from patients infected by a virus usually contains neutralizing antibodies that stop the growth of the virus \u2013 whatever its identity \u2013 when added to a cell culture in which the virus has been successfully grown.\n\nWhen the researchers added serum from SARS patients to the cell culture, virus growth was halted. Serum from uninfected healthy controls had no effect on the virus.\n\n\u201cThis is not just some light at the end of the tunnel,\u201d said WHO virologist Dr Klaus St\u00f6hr, who is coordinating the collaborative laboratory efforts. \u201cThis is a real ray of sunshine.\u201d\n\nWHO cautions, however, that the number of patients in the test was small and more work needs to be done. The scientific community is excited by the news, which could be regarded as the first important step towards the development of a diagnostic test.\n\nThe infectious agent resembles the morphology of a Paramyxovirus. Scientists cannot, however, be certain about the identity of the virus, which may indeed be a new Paramyxovirus or another virus with a similar morphology. \n\nThe laboratory is one of 11 leading labs participating in an international multicentre research project. The project was set up by WHO on Monday to expedite identification of the causative agent \u2013 considered by several research groups to be a member of the Paramyxoviridae family of viruses \u2013 and rapidly develop a diagnostic test.\n\nWHO team of experts travelling to China \n\nA WHO team of five infectious disease experts will be travelling over the weekend to China to support investigations there of an outbreak of atypical pneumonia that began in Guangdong Province in mid-November.\n\nThe multinational team was assembled in response to a request from the Chinese Ministry of Health for epidemiological and laboratory support to aid ongoing investigation of the outbreak. The team will also assist in laboratory work that might lead to identification of the causative agent.\n\nThe team includes experts in virology, laboratory techniques, epidemiological investigation, and the control of unusual infectious diseases. Team members, of American, Australian, British, and German nationality, have been drawn from institutes participating in the WHO Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network.\n\nThe outbreak in southern China is linked geographically and by timing to the current outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which first surfaced in Asia in mid-February and caused its first known death on 13 March. Cases of this new disease have now been detected in 13 countries on three continents. Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, which as of today accounts for 203 of the 350 suspected or probable cases reported worldwide, remains the most severely affected area.\n\nApart from searching for the causative agent, the WHO team is expected to help Chinese scientists determine whether the Guangdong outbreak included cases that fit the current definition of SARS.\n\nConclusive identification of the causative agent, which is thought to be a virus of the Paramyxoviridae family, would greatly aid the investigation by Chinese scientists and the WHO team, which is expected to begin on Monday.\n\nResearch on the identity of the SARS pathogen is progressing rapidly within a network of 11 leading laboratories set up by WHO earlier this week. WHO remains optimistic that a definitive announcement of the cause of SARS can be made soon.\n\nHistory of the Guangdong outbreak \n\nWHO was first officially informed of the outbreak on 11 February, when the Chinese Ministry of Health reported that 305 cases of acute respiratory syndrome of unknown cause had occurred in six municipalities in Guangdong Province in southern China. Five deaths were reported. Transmission of the disease was largely confined to health care workers (105 doctors, nurses, and other medical workers) and household contacts of patients.\n\nOn 14 February, WHO was informed by the Chinese Ministry of Health that the outbreak was clinically consistent with atypical pneumonia. Reported symptoms included fever, dizziness, muscle soreness, and bouts of coughing. Patients had acute symptoms, included high fever, dry cough, muscle pain, and weakness, and required hospitalization. The Chinese authorities also provided information that cases had been detected in the province as far back as 16 November 2002.\n\nIn mid-February, some Chinese experts concluded that the outbreak was caused by chlamydial organisms. Others speculated that a virus might be the cause.\n\nIt is hoped that the WHO team can help authorities quickly resolve these and other outstanding questions about the Guangdong outbreak.\n\nUpdate on cases and affected countries As of 21 March, 350 suspected and probable cases, including 10 deaths, have been reported from 13 countries. These figures represent an additional 44 cases and two new countries compared with the previous day. The number of deaths remains unchanged.\n\nCountries reported their first suspected cases are Italy and the Republic of Ireland, each reporting one case. New cases were reported in Hong Kong (30), Singapore (5), Taiwan, China (2), Thailand (3), and the United States of America (2).\n\nNew guidelines for health authorities WHO has today posted on its web site two documents to assist national authorities in the investigation and management of cases. The first gives a more complete, though still preliminary, clinical picture of SARS, pooled from findings provided by clinicians treating SARS patients in seven countries. It is anticipated that the clinical description will help health authorities recognize cases with greater precision. \n\nThe second document provides advice, including recommended laboratory tests and radiological findings, that can guide the safe discharge and follow-up of convalescent cases. The policy advice aims to ensure that the release of recovered patients carries no risks for family members and other close contacts. Until more is known about the etiological agent, and the potential for continued carriage, WHO is recommending a cautious approach.",

        "Description of the Situation": "Disease Outbreak Reported\n20 March 2003 \n\nInvestigation of causative agent gains momentum\nHighly specialized testing of specimens from patients ill with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) continues at top speed in top labs, expedited by electronic sharing of results. WHO is increasingly optimistic that conclusive identification of the causative agent can be announced soon. The development of a precise diagnostic test could follow quickly.\nCollaboration in the race to find the causative agent is taking place within the framework of a network of labs set up on Monday.\nResearch is now focused on the Paramyxoviridae family of viruses. This family includes several well-known viruses, such as those causing mumps, measles and common respiratory ailments. It also includes a subfamily of viruses capable of infecting multiple animal species, including humans. This subfamily was implicated in the emergence during the 1990s of new and severe diseases in humans caused by Hendra and Nipah viruses. The virus jumped directly from animal hosts (horses and pigs) to humans. No person-to-person transmission was documented in outbreaks caused by either virus. \nNew treatment network\nWHO has today established a cooperative network of clinicians for SARS diagnosis and treatment. The network brings together, via two daily teleconferences, clinicians in the most heavily affected Asian countries and in Europe and North America. Clinicians participate on the basis of either first-hand experience in the management of SARS cases or leading expertise in the diagnosis and management of unusual infectious diseases.\nParticipants are pooling data on cases and sharing X-ray pictures. Chest X-rays are, at present, one of the main tools for distinguishing between suspected and probable cases. Treatment guidelines, including criteria for safe discharge of patients from hospitals, are also being established on the basis of shared experiences.\nPending definitive identification of the causative agent, a combination of treatments are being tried to cure cases. WHO is providing support, in the form of protective equipment and supplies, to help the most heavily affected hospitals prevent further spread within hospital settings, where the overwhelming majority of new infections have occurred.\nIf a paramyxovirus is confirmed to be the cause, WHO will be in a much better position to recommend a treatment.\nThe antiviral drug, ribavirin, may be responsible for some degree of clinical improvement observed in critically ill patients in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China. Intensive and good supportive care have also been associated with improved prospects of recovery.\nUpdate on cases and affected countries\nAs of 20 March, 306 suspected and probable cases, including 10 deaths, have been reported from eleven countries. These figures represent an additional 42 cases and one death compared with the previous day. Increases were reported in Canada (1), Hong Kong (23), Singapore (3), Taiwan, China (1), the United Kingdom (1), and Viet Nam (6). Switzerland, reporting 7 suspected cases, was added to the list.\nPossible cases in airline passengers and crew member ruled out\nPress reports have referred to 2 suspected cases of SARS, one in an airline crew member and a second in a passenger, travelling on separate flights from Hong Kong and Taipei to Viet Nam. \nBoth suspected cases have been investigated and are now ruled out as cases of SARS. \nIndex case in Hong Kong outbreak\nWHO has welcomed a report from the Hong Kong Department of Health, released yesterday, that may have identified the \u201cindex\u201d case in the outbreak in the Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong. In an outstanding example of detective work, epidemiologists have determined that 7 people who contracted SARS recently stayed in or visited the Metropole hotel in Kowloon last month. The 7 persons investigated include 3 visitors from Singapore, 2 from Canada, one China Mainland visitor, and a local Hong Kong resident. \nThe investigation revealed that all 7 stayed in or visited the same floor of the hotel between 12 February and 2 March. The local Hong Kong resident is believed to be the index case, who subsequently infected other early cases in the outbreak. He had visited an acquaintance staying at the hotel from 15 to 23 February. The visitor from Mainland China, who became sick a week before staying at the hotel, is considered the original source of the infection. No further cases have been linked to the hotel. \nAbsolute need for continued vigilance\nWHO is underscoring the need for continued vigilance. Experience with other emerging diseases makes it clear that, should the causative agent turn out to be a virus, the new disease could establish endemicity, especially in light of abundantly documented human-to-human transmission. The world must protect itself against the widespread establishment of another new infectious disease.\nWHO concern is now increasingly focused on preparation to assist vulnerable countries in the likely event that cases continue to spread. Up to now, all imported cases have occurred in countries well-equipped and well-prepared to institute WHO-recommended precautions, including isolation and barrier nursing practices, for preventing spread to others, whether health care workers or family members. In view of the rapid spread of this disease to new countries via exposed air travellers, any country with an international airport is potentially at risk.\nThis focus on preparedness underscores the need for a concerted effort to defend global public health security. In an era of close interconnectedness and rapid air travel, an outbreak anywhere in the world is a potential threat to health everywhere. \nInternational collaboration \u2013 on the part of the medical and research communities, multinational teams in the field, and health authorities around the world \u2013 in the reporting, investigation, and management of this outbreak has been outstanding.",

        "Description of the Situation": "Disease Outbreak Reported \n 19 March 2003\n\nPreliminary findings suggest a viral cause \nResearch teams at two laboratories, in Germany and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, have detected particles of a virus from the Paramyxoviridae family in samples taken from patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). \nThis is the first major step forward in efforts to pinpoint the causative agent. Previous tests conducted in a number of top laboratories failed to detect the presence of any known bacteria or viruses, including the influenza viruses, recognized as causes of pneumonia or respiratory symptoms, or known to be widespread in the most affected geographical areas. \nThe failure of all previous efforts to detect the presence of bacteria and viruses known to cause respiratory disease strongly suggests that the causative agent may be a novel pathogen. \nFirm conclusions about the identity of the causative agent are premature. All teams have stressed that these are preliminary results only. Further studies are needed before it can be concluded, with confidence, that the causative agent has been identified. \nCollaborative efforts continue. All research teams are participants in the international multicentre SARS research project, linking together 11 leading laboratories, that was set up on Monday 17 March. Coordinated research is expected to expedite definitive identification of the causative agent. \nThe detection of paramyxovirus particles in samples from infected patients is the first lead to a possible cause of SARS and will be extremely important in focusing ongoing research. Definitive identification of the causative agent will help physicians move from the current \u201chit-or-miss\u201d approach to treatment to a more precise selection of drugs with a greater prospect of cure. Knowledge of the causative agent will also speed development of a diagnostic test and thus give physicians and national health authorities a powerful tool for the identification of cases. It will also reassure the many \u201cworried well\u201d now presenting at health facilities, and reduce the number of false alarms. \nUpdate on countries and cases\nAs of Wednesday 19 March, a cumulative total of 264 suspected or probable cases and 9 deaths have been reported from 10 countries (Canada, China, Germany Singapore, Slovenia, Spain, Thailand, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, and Viet Nam). Hong Kong SAR, Hanoi (Viet Nam), and Singapore continue to be the most affected areas. Full details are provided in tabular form. \nAwareness of the disease is now very high throughout the world. Surveillance is proving to be sensitive, with suspected cases rapidly detected, reported to national authorities and WHO, and investigated according to the standard case definition. \nThe Paramyxoviridae family\nViruses in the Paramyxoviridae family include many common, well-known agents associated with respiratory infections, such as respiratory syncytial virus, and childhood illnesses, including the viruses that cause mumps and measles. Some of these viruses are widespread, particularly during the winter season. Screening of specimens could therefore be expected to detect particles of these common viruses. At this point, it cannot be ruled out entirely that tests for the SARS agent are detecting such \u201cbackground\u201d viruses rather than the true causative agent. \nThe Paramyxoviridae family also includes two recently recognized pathogens, Hendra virus and Nipah virus. These related viruses are unusual in the family in that they can infect and cause potentially fatal disease in a number of animal hosts, including humans. Most other viruses in the family tend to infect a single animal species only.\nNipah virus first began to cause deaths in humans in Peninsular Malaysia in 1998 in persons in close contact with pigs. The outbreak caused 265 cases of human encephalitis, including 105 deaths. Two separate outbreaks of Hendra virus, associated with severe respiratory disease in horses, caused two human deaths in Australia in 1994 and 1995. No human-to-human transmission was documented in either outbreak. No treatment was available for cases caused by either of these two viruses. Human-to-human transmission did not occur.",

        "Description of the Situation": "18 March 2003  Disease Outbreak Reported\n\nAdvice for travellers\n\nCurrently available findings from the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), continue to indicate that the overwhelming majority of cases are occurring in health care workers, and their families who have had direct contact with SARS patients. The number of cases without such close contact remains few, and no data indicate that this number is rapidly increasing. Based on current knowledge, WHO considers that the emergency travel advice issued on Saturday 15th March remains valid.\n\nWHO advises that no restrictions on travel to any destination are necessary. Persons travelling to Asia and the Far East should be aware of the major symptoms of SARS, and of the need to report promptly to a health care worker in the unlikely event that they fall ill during their travel or after returning home.\n\nFor the full WHO travel advisory, together with additional information about this disease.Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)\n\n\nCurrent situation\n\nIsolated cases of suspected SARS continue to be reported in new countries. As of today, health authorities are investigating reported cases in Canada, China, Taiwan (China), Germany, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, Singapore, Slovenia, Thailand, Viet Nam, and the United Kingdom. Further details, including cumulative number of cases and deaths, are given in the table below.\nCumulative number of reported suspect and probable cases\n\n\nAt present, the vast majority of cases are concentrated in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China and Hanoi, Viet Nam. Singapore is currently reporting the third largest number of cases. All reported cases in other parts of the world are linked to travel within the past 10 days to one of these destinations. It remains undetermined whether an outbreak of atypical pneumonia in southern China, which began in November, is related to the current outbreaks.\n\nIn Hanoi, 13 of the 57 patients are showing signs of clinical improvement.\n\nTwo cases suspected in Switzerland on Monday have been investigated and ruled out as cases of SARS.\n\nAwareness of the disease is now very high throughout the world. Surveillance is proving to be sensitive, with suspected cases rapidly detected, reported to national authorities and WHO, and investigated according to the standard case definition.\n\nAn increase in the number of suspected cases is to be expected in such an atmosphere of heightened awareness.\n\nIn areas where person-to-person transmission has been documented, cases have occurred almost exclusively in health care workers or in persons in very close contact with patients, such as family members. Currently available data indicate that transmission of the infectious agent requires direct and close contact. There is no evidence of transmission following casual contact.\n\nDue to heightened awareness, cases are now being quickly identified and immediately isolated. No cases of secondary transmission are occurring following the detection and proper management of imported cases.\n\nProtective measures and strict barrier nursing procedures are now in place in hospitals in all areas where cases have been reported. In areas where person-to-person transmission has occurred, these measures are expected to decrease transmission to health staff and families of patients. Strict protective measures in countries managing imported cases are likewise expected to reduce the risk that the disease will spread to others within these countries.\n\nEfforts are under way to expedite identification of the causative agent, improve diagnostic precision, and develop a diagnostic test. A network of 11 highly qualified laboratories in 10 countries was established yesterday and has begun data sharing and regular reporting today.\n\nMany countries have activated well-designed national preparedness plans for dealing with an emerging infectious disease. The global surveillance system, which WHO coordinates, is working well in the ways needed to prevent the outbreak from becoming a global epidemic.\n\nUpdates on the development of the SARS outbreak are regularly posted on the WHO website",

        "Description of the Situation": "17 March 2003Disease Outbreak Reported\n\nNOTE FOR THE PRESS ISSUED BY WHO17 March 2003\nWHO coordinates international effort to identify and treat SARS \n\n17 March 2003 -- WHO has today stepped up several activities aimed at strengthening the international response to the recent emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). SARS is an infectious disease of unknown etiology characterized by atypical pneumonia (see WHO press release of 15 March and additional information at www.who.int.)\n\nThe disease is spread from person to person but only through close contact with a case. To date, almost all reported cases have occurred in health workers involved in the direct care of reported cases or in close contacts, such as family members. There is no evidence to date that the disease spreads though casual contact.\n\nThe WHO Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network is coordinating an international multicenter effort to identify the causative agent. The project unites 11 laboratories in 10 countries. Participating laboratories have the most experience to date in diagnosis of cases, or are known for their high-level facilities and expertise. The collaborative effort will also improve diagnostic precision and move work forward on the development of a diagnostic test. WHO is also working with health authorities to identify an effective treatment for SARS.\n\nWHO Global Outbreak Alert and Response teams in Hanoi and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China, where the most new cases are presently concentrated, are assisting health authorities in outbreak management and in the collection of epidemiological and clinical data that can improve understanding of SARS.\n\nThrough its regional office in Manila, Philippines, WHO is establishing logistics bases and supply chains to ensure rapid provision of protective equipment and medicines needed for outbreak response.\n\nChinese authorities have now issued a summary report on an outbreak of what may be the same or a related disease that began in Guangdong province in southern China in November and peaked in mid-February. The Chinese report, which includes data on the diagnosis and management of more than 300 cases, is presently undergoing analysis and is expected to further contribute to understanding about the syndrome and possible links among the various outbreaks. The Chinese report, which covers the largest number of cases to date, may also boost international efforts to establish effective treatment guidelines, should a relationship between the outbreaks be established.\n\nThe Ministry of Health of China has requested support from an international team. A WHO team is now being assembled.\n\nHealth authorities around the world are now alert to the risk of SARS. Tracking of the course of the epidemic shows that surveillance systems are sensitive, communication channels are open, and reporting is rapid. Information on cases compiled over the past three weeks is expected to shed new light on the behaviour of this disease.\n\nThe speed of international travel creates a risk of rapid spread to additional areas. Because the clinical course and epidemiological behaviour of this disease are poorly understood, WHO is calling upon national health authorities to maintain close vigilance for suspected cases. There is no current justification for any restriction in travel or trade.\n\nDaily summary of reported cases of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)   Cumulative number of reported suspect and probable cases of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)   From: 1 Feb 2003\n To: 17 Mar 2003\n\n\nFor more information contact:\n\nDick Thompson - Communication Officer Communicable Disease Prevention, Control and Eradication WHO, Geneva Telephone: (+41 22) 791 26 84 Email: [email\u00a0protected]",

        "Description of the Situation": "16 March 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported\n\nAs of 15 March 2003, reports of over 150 cases of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), an atypical pneumonia of unknown aetiology, have been received by the World Health Organization (WHO) since 26 February 2003 ( see previous report  ). WHO is co-ordinating the international investigation of this outbreak and is working closely with health authorities in the affected countries to provide epidemiological, clinical and logistical support as required.\n\nSARS was first recognised on the 26 February 2003 in Hanoi, Viet Nam. The causative agent has yet to be identified. The main symptoms and signs include high fever (>38 degrees C), cough, shortness of breath or breathing difficulties (see Case definitions for Surveillance of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome). A proportion of patients with SARS develop severe pneumonia; some of whom have needed ventilator support. As of 15 March, four deaths have been reported. \n\nAs of 15 March the majority of cases have occurred in people who have had very close contact with other cases and over 90% of cases have occurred in health care workers.\n\nThe mode of transmission and the causative agent have yet to be determined. Aerosol and/or droplet spread is possible as is transmission from body fluids. Respiratory isolation, strict respiratory and mucosal barrier nursing are recommended for cases. Cases should be treated as clinically indicated. (see below for further details). \n\n\nHospital infection control guidance for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) \n\n\n\nAn epidemic of atypical pneumonia had previously been reported by the Chinese government starting in November 2002 in Guangdong Province. This epidemic is reported to be under control. \n\nHanoi, Viet Nam On the 26 February 2003, a man (index case) was admitted to hospital in Hanoi with a high fever, dry cough, myalgia and mild sore throat. Over the next four days he developed increasing breathing difficulties, severe thrombocytopenia, and signs of Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome and required ventilator support. Despite intensive therapy he died on the 13 March after being transferred to Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China.\n\nOn 5 March, seven health care workers who had cared for the index case also became ill (high fever, myalgia, headache and less often sore throat). The onset of illness ranged from 4 to 7 days after admission of the index case.\n\nAs of 15 March, 43 cases have been reported in Viet Nam. At least five of these patients are currently requiring ventilator support. Two deaths have occurred. With the exception of one case (the son of a health care worker) all cases to date have had direct contact with the hospital where the index case had first received treatment.\n\nHong Kong Special Administrative Region of China \nInfluenza A(H5N1) reported in February\nOn 12 March 2003, 20 health care workers developed influenza-like symptoms (high fever, headache and lower respiratory symptoms). Since then the number of reported cases has increased daily.\n\nAs of 15 March, over 100 reported cases have been hospitalised, at least two of whom are receiving ventilatory support. One death (index case from Viet Nam) has been reported.\n\nSingapore On 13 March 2003, the Ministry of Health in Singapore reported three cases of SARS in people who had recently returned to Singapore after travelling to Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China.\n\nAs of 15 March 2003, 13 additional cases have been reported. All 13 of these cases have had very close contact with one or more of the initial three cases.\n\nAll 16 cases are reported to be in a stable condition and are being cared for in isolation.\n\nThailand As of 15 March 2003, one imported case has been reported in Thailand. The case (a health care worker) travelled to Thailand on the 11 March from Hanoi, Viet Nam. The case is known to have had close contact with the Hanoi index case and to have been unwell on arrival in Thailand. The case was immediately isolated on arrival in Thailand and reported to be in a stable condition and is being cared for in isolation. There is no evidence of transmission of SARS in Thailand.\n\nCanada As of 15 March 2003, seven cases have been reported in Canada; two of whom have died. The cases have occurred in two separate extended family clusters. In both clusters at least one member of the family had travelled to Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China within a week of developing symptoms.\n\nPhilippines and Indonesia Unconfirmed reports of a single case in the Philippines to date. However one close contact of the Hanoi index case is under observation in an isolation facility. This person is reported to be well.\n\nUnconfirmed reports of a single case in Indonesia were received on the 15 March. However further reports have confirmed that this person does not fulfill the case definition. As of 16 March, there are therefore no reported cases in Indonesia.\n\nNew York, USA \u2013 Frankfurt, Germany On 15 March 2003, a health care worker from Singapore who was visiting New York boarded a flight from New York to Frankfurt. The health care worker was known to be unwell and to have had recent close contact with a reported case of SARS in Singapore. German health authorities were notified and the health care worker was transferred to an isolation unit in Frankfurt as soon as the flight landed. There is no evidence of transmission in Germany.\n\nLaboratory Investigation Various specimens have been collected from cases and post-mortum examinations. A wide range of laboratory tests have been conducted to date but no agent has been definitively identified. Laboratory investigations are continuing.\n\nInternational Response WHO is assisting affected countries in responding to the various outbreaks. Extensive epidemiological and clinical investigation are ongoing in all affected countries.\n\nWHO/Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network team of epidemiologists, case management, infection control experts and laboratory experts is assisting the Vietnamese health authorities. The following organisations are contributing personnel and materials to the Hanoi team: \n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, United States\nCentre of International Health, Australia\nEpicentre\nInstitut National de Veille Sanitaire, France\nInstitut Pasteur, France and Viet Nam\nM\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res\nNational Health Service, Department of Health, United Kingdom\nRobert Koch Institute, Germany\nCentral Field Epidemiology Group Smittskyddsinstitutet (SMI), Sweden \n\n\nBilateral assistance has also been mobilised from France and Japan.\nWHO is providing epidemiological support to health authorities in Hong Kong.\n\nTravel Advice There is presently no recommendations to restrict travel to any destination. However, guidance has been issued by WHO and is available. World Health Organization issues emergency travel advisory\n\nFurther Information Throughout this outbreak, WHO plans to update its web site on a daily basis.",

        "Description of the Situation": "12 March 2003\nDisease Outbreak Reported\n\nPRESS RELEASE ISSUED BY WHO12 March 2003\nWHO issues a global alert about cases of atypical pneumonia\n\nCases of severe respiratory illness may spread to hospital staff\n\n12 March 2003 | GENEVA -- Since mid February, WHO has been actively working to confirm reports of outbreaks of a severe form of pneumonia in Viet Nam, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), China, and Guangdong province in China.\n\nIn Viet Nam the outbreak began with a single initial case who was hospitalized for treatment of severe, acute respiratory syndrome of unknown origin. He felt unwell during his journey and fell ill shortly after arrival in Hanoi from Shanghai and Hong Kong SAR, China. Following his admission to the hospital, approximately 20 hospital staff became sick with similar symptoms.\n\nThe signs and symptoms of the disease in Hanoi include initial flu-like illness (rapid onset of high fever followed by muscle aches, headache and sore throat). These are the most common symptoms. Early laboratory findings may include thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) and leucopenia (low white blood cell count). In some, but not all cases, this is followed by bilateral pneumonia, in some cases progressing to acute respiratory distress requiring assisted breathing on a respirator. Some patients are recovering but some patients remain critically ill.\n\nToday, the Department of Health Hong Kong SAR has reported on an outbreak of respiratory illness in one of its public hospitals. As of midnight 11 March, 50 health care workers had been screened and 23 of them were found to have febrile illness. They were admitted to the hospital for observation as a precautionary measure. In this group, eight have developed early chest x-ray signs of pneumonia. Their conditions are stable. Three other health care workers self-presented to hospitals with febrile illness and two of them have chest x-ray signs of pneumonia.\n\nInvestigation by Hong Kong SAR public health authorities is on-going. The Hospital Authority has increased infection control measures to prevent the spread of the disease in the hospital. So far, no link has been found between these cases and the outbreak in Hanoi.\n\nIn mid February, the Government of China reported that 305 cases of atypical pneumonia, with five deaths, had occurred in Guangdong province. In two cases that died, chlamydia infection was found. Further investigations of the cause of the outbreak is ongoing. Overall the outbreaks in Hanoi and Hong Kong SAR appear to be confined to the hospital environment. Those at highest risk appear to be staff caring for the patients.\n\nNo link has so far been made between these outbreaks of acute respiratory illness in Hanoi and Hong Kong and the outbreak of `bird flu,` A(H5N1) in Hong Kong SAR reported on 19 February. Further investigations continue and laboratory tests on specimens from Viet Nam and Hong Kong SAR are being studied by WHO collaborating centres in Japan and the United States.\n\nUntil more is known about the cause of these outbreaks, WHO recommends patients with atypical pneumonia who may be related to these outbreaks be isolated with barrier nursing techniques. At the same time, WHO recommends that any suspect cases be reported to national health authorities.\n\nWHO is in close contact with relevant national authorities and has also offered epidemiological, laboratory and clinical support. WHO is working with national authorities to ensure appropriate investigation, reporting and containment of these outbreaks.\n\nFor more information contact:\n\nDick Thompson - Communication Officer Communicable Disease Prevention, Control and Eradication WHO, Geneva Telephone: (+41 22) 791 26 84 Email: [email\u00a0protected]",
