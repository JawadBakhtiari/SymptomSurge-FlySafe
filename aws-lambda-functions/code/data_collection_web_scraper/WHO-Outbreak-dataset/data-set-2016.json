        "Date Reported": "27 December 2016",
        "Location": "Pakistan",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "In Pakistan, a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) has been detected from environmental samples in Quetta, Balochistan. Two isolates with apparent genetic linkages were isolated from environmental samples, collected on 20 October and 28 November 2016. Virus was isolated from environmental samples only and no associated cases of paralysis linked to the isolated strains have been detected in Quetta or anywhere else in the province.Pakistan also continues to be affected by endemic transmission of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1). As of 21 December, 19 WPV1 cases have been reported in 2016. It is the lowest number of annual cases ever reported, from the fewest number of affected areas in the country. The majority of the polio cases during the last six months were reported from non-reservoir areas, i.e. from \u2018tier 2, 3 and 4\u2019 districts (districts which are considered to be more vulnerable to polio re-infection). There have been no paralytic cases of wild poliovirus from the traditional polio reservoirs in Pakistan since February 2016.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "A response with monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in the Quetta and neighbouring districts is now planned, in line with internationally-agreed protocols. The first campaign of a series of campaigns is planned for 2 January 2017. In addition, the Ministry of National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination (MoHSRC), supported by World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF and other partners, is further strengthening active search for cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), and conducting an in-depth field investigation to more clearly ascertain the circulation of this strain. Pakistan continues to implement the National Emergency Action Plan for polio eradication, to urgently interrupt all remaining strains of polio transmission in the country.The area affected by the reported type 2 virus is part of a transnational common reservoir for WPV1 that extends into Southern Afghanistan. Interrupting WPV1 transmission in this area remains the top most priority of the federal, provincial and district health teams. Meticulous preparations are underway through the national and provincial Emergency Operations Centres (EOCs) and District Polio Control Rooms for high quality implementation of upcoming back-to-back national and sub-national vaccination rounds, in December 2016, January 2017 and February 2017 using bivalent oral polio vaccine (bOPV). These campaigns are critical to addressing the remaining pockets of under-immunized populations sustaining low-intensity WPV1 transmission within the common reservoir.To ensure high quality, preparations are focusing on allocating adequate resources to the highest-risk areas; tailoring operational plans to identified reasons for missed children; validating vaccination teams\u2019 microplans, vaccinator selection, training and supervision; and enhancing local engagement with communities through community leaders. In order to jointly address transmission across the common reservoir, close coordination is ongoing with Afghanistan teams at all levels.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "WHO assesses the risk of international spread of WPV1 within the common reservoir between Pakistan and Afghanistan to be high (due to the historical spread of such strains across the joint epidemiological block with Afghanistan). WHO also assesses the risk of spread of cVDPV2 within the common reservoir as medium to high. Risk of international spread of WPV1 or cVDPV2 to other countries is assessed low.",
        "WHO Advice": "It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases in order to rapidly detect any new virus importation and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction.WHO\u2019s International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents (and visitors for more than 4 weeks) from infected areas should receive an additional dose of OPV or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) within 4 weeks to 12 months of travel.As per the advice of an Emergency Committee convened under the International Health Regulations (2005), efforts to limit the international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Countries affected by poliovirus transmission is subject to Temporary Recommendations. To comply with the Temporary Recommendations issued under the PHEIC, any country infected by poliovirus should declare the outbreak as a national public health emergency and consider vaccination of all international travellers. Any country that exports poliovirus should ensure vaccination of all international travellers before departure.",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 20 December 2016, the Department of Health (DOH), Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) notified WHO of a case of laboratory-confirmed human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus.Details of the caseThe case is a 75-year-old man who travelled to Dongguan, Guangdong province from 28 November to 9 December 2016. He developed chest discomfort on 8 December and he visited a hospital there. He returned to Hong Kong SAR on 9 December and was directly admitted to hospital from point of entry by ambulance for cough with sputum, shortness of breath, runny nose and chest discomfort.His nasopharyngeal swab taken on 9 December tested positive for enterovirus/ rhinovirus and negative for influenza virus. His nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) taken on 19 December was positive for avian influenza A(H7N9) virus RNA. He was reported to be in severe condition at the time of report. His condition further deteriorated to critical on 21 December. He had visited a wet market in Dongguan and bought a dressed chicken. DOH's investigation is ongoing, and DOH is communicating with the Guangdong health authority.To date, a total of 808 laboratory-confirmed human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported through IHR notification since early 2013.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "The Centre for Health Protection of the Department of Health has taken the following measures:Urged the public to maintain strict personal, food and environmental hygiene both locally and during travel.Issued an alert to doctors, hospitals, schools and institutions of the latest situation.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Most human cases are exposed to avian influenza A(H7N9) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, including live poultry markets. Since the virus continues to be detected in animals and environments, further human cases can be expected. Although small clusters of human cases with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported including those involving healthcare workers, current epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans. Therefore further community level spread is considered unlikely.Human infections with the avian influenza A(H7N9) virus are unusual and need to be monitored closely in order to identify changes in the virus and/or its transmission behaviour to humans as it may have a serious public health impact.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid, if possible, poultry farms, contact with animals in live bird markets, entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water, and follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling in or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and influenza-like illness (ILI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005), and continue national health preparedness actions.",

        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "MERS-CoV causes severe human infections resulting in high mortality and has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings.The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to animals or animal products (for example, following contact with dromedaries) or human source (for example, in a health care setting). WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.",
        "WHO Advice": "Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS-CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.",

        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "The Chinese Government has taken the following surveillance and control measures:Strengthened surveillance and assessment analysis.Further enhanced medical care of the cases.Conducted public risk communication.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Most human cases are exposed to avian influenza A(H7N9) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, including live poultry markets. Since the virus continues to be detected in animals and environments, further human cases can be expected. Although small clusters of human cases with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported including those involving healthcare workers, current epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans. Therefore further community level spread is considered unlikely.Human infections with the avian influenza A(H7N9) virus are unusual and need to be monitored closely in order to identify changes in the virus and/or its transmission behaviour to humans as the virus may have a serious public health impact.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid, if possible, poultry farms, contact with animals in live bird markets, entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water, and follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling in or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and influenza-like illness (ILI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005), and continue national health preparedness actions.",

It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS-CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.Food hygiene practices should be observed.

        "WHO Risk Assessment": "WHO, through its Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), continues to closely monitor the avian influenza A(H5N6) virus and other zoonotic influenza events. So far, the overall public health risk associated with the avian influenza A(H5N6) virus has not changed. Avian influenza A(H5N6) viruses have caused severe infection in humans, and thus far, human infections with the virus seem to be sporadic with no ongoing human-to-human transmission. However the specific risk associated with the virus strains infecting the reported cases will be assessed when the viruses are received and characterized in the GISRS laboratories.The risk of international disease spread is considered to be low at this point in time.

        "Description of the Situation": "Since August 2016, suspected dengue fever cases and deaths have been reported in Ouagadougou, the capital city of Burkina Faso.From 5 August to 12 November 2016, a total of 1061 probable (Dengue Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) positive) cases out of 1266 suspected cases were reported with a cumulative total of 15 deaths (CFR 1.2%). All cases have been reported from all 12 districts of Ouagadougou. In addition, two other regions have reported cases, Sahel Region in the north (12 RDT positive cases) and the Hauts-Bassins region in the west (6 RDT positive cases).Among the RDT positive cases, 273 cases in Ouagadougou were well documented. The main signs reported by patients include headaches (77 %), joint pains (51%), gastrointestinal symptoms (47 %) and haemorrhagic symptoms (6%). 70% of affected people are over the age of 25 with a mean age of 30 years. In addition, women are more affected than men. 61 samples have been sent to Institut Pasteur de Dakar (IPD), a WHO Collaborating Centre for Arbovirus, on 9 November for confirmatory testing. The preliminary results, received on 14 November 2016, show that 29 samples (47.5%) were dengue positive (qRT-PCR). The serotype 2 has been identified and further tests are required. Results for genetic sequencing are pending.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "The Ministry of Health (MoH) has established an integrated disease surveillance and response (IDSR) mechanism but dengue surveillance was not included. There is a plan to include dengue to increase the surveillance capacity.An initial investigation was performed between 24 to 28 October into six health facilities and further investigations are ongoing.Coordination is ensured by holding weekly meetings of the national epidemic management committee along with the health authorities and the other ministerial departments involved in the response.A response plan has been developed which includes vector control and risk communication.An update of dengue surveillance tools and guidelines for cases detection and management was carried out and tools were disseminated to individuals in the response.The Ministry of Health plans to strengthen the capacity of the national reference laboratory for viral haemorrhagic fevers, with additional support being deployed by IPD and WHO.Delivery and dissemination of dengue awareness, case management and preventive measures messages translated into different country's own official languages.The main hospitals in Ouagadougou are providing mosquito nets for the patients affected by severe dengue (for more information on severe dengue, see \u201cFact sheet on dengue\u201d).Free medical care and treatment for severe cases of dengue.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Dengue has occurred in the context of low establishment of dengue surveillance in Burkina Faso. Many health facilities do not have access to dengue RDT. Case definitions and case management guidelines are not sufficiently disseminated therefore healthcare workers are not well trained on dengue surveillance, specifically case detection and notification. Awareness of the disease among health care workers and prevention is lacking as the surveillance of this disease is not well established despite an IDSR mechanism.Although the rainy season has ended, the potential for a high density of mosquitoes is still present as vector breeding sites at household and community level are numerous. Discussions are ongoing among stakeholders and entomologists on vector control interventions in the community. Vector control measures should identify the most productive breeding sites (identify where most larval density is detected) and identify reduction measures with active support of the community should be initiated. Entomological monitoring in select sites should be carried out to assess impact of all control measures. The use of mosquito nets for hospitalised viraemic patients should be considered. In addition, prevention measures at the individual level should be taken.Furthermore, it is important to highlight that the focus for healthcare workers and the general public is malaria rather than dengue. Therefore, there is a need to strengthen early diagnosis capacity, community awareness through communication, social mobilization, community engagement interventions, vector control and to reinforce clinical management guidance to better respond to this outbreak.Ouagadougou is the capital of Burkina Faso with major roads routes and rail links to neighbouring countries and an international airport. Additionally, there is frequent movement of populations to and from neighbouring countries. Currently there is no evidence indicating dengue outbreaks in the neighbouring regions, however the prior circulation of dengue virus cannot be ruled out. Insufficient information is available to assess this risk.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO recommends that countries should only consider introduction of the dengue vaccine CYD-TDV in geographic settings (national or subnational) where epidemiological data indicate a high burden of disease. Currently there is insufficient evidence of a high prevalence of dengue in Burkina Faso, further investigations are required.Prevention of dengue through vector control methods such as mosquito habitat removal and use of insecticides (indoor space spraying and outdoor fogging), and prevention measures at individual level (use of repellents, wearing light coloured, long sleeved shirts and pants and ensuring rooms are fitted with screens to prevent mosquitoes from entering) are recommended.WHO does not recommend that any general travel or trade restrictions be applied on Burkina Faso based on the information available for this event.",

        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Most human cases had history of exposure to the A(H7N9) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, including live poultry markets. As long as the virus continues to be detected in animals and environments, further human cases can be expected. Although small clusters of human cases with influenza A(H7N9) viruses have been reported including those involving healthcare workers, current epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans. Therefore further community level spread is considered unlikely.Human infections with the A(H7N9) virus are unusual and should be monitored closely in order to identify changes in the virus and/or its transmissibility in humans which may have a serious public health impact.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid, if possible, poultry farms, contact with animals in live bird markets, entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water, and follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling in or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and influenza-like illness (ILI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005), and continue national health preparedness actions.",

Monkeypox is usually transmitted to humans through contact with an infected animal or through infected animal bites. Person-to-person transmission can also occur during outbreaks through close contact with patients but there is no evidence to date that person-to-person transmission alone can sustain monkeypox transmission in humans.Given the lack of adequately equipped isolation units in healthcare facilities in the area and the known transmission dynamics of monkeypox between humans, the WHO encourages individuals and healthcare workers to follow infection prevention and control procedures when caring for patients, to prevent transmission of disease.Given the location of the outbreak in a relatively remote and sparsely populated area at this stage the risk of international spread seems limited.The WHO does not recommend any restriction for travel and trade to Central African Republic based on available information at this point in time.",

The area is mainly populated by nomadic stockbreeders. Most of the cases are male (62.5%), and work as farmers or animal breeders. In the affected area, an epizootic outbreak is also reported among livestock during the same time duration, including deaths and abortions among cattle and small ruminants. As of 16 September 2016, 6 of the 13 human specimens tested at Institute Pasteur (IP), Dakar were positive for Rift Valley Fever (RVF). Among the 6 animal specimens tested, 3 were positive for RVF.

Ministries of Health and Agriculture/Livestock have developed a national response plan.The WHO Country Office continues to provide technical and financial support for surveillance, outbreak investigation, technical guidelines regarding case definition, case management, shipment of samples and risk communication.FAO, OIE, and WHO are coordinating on animal and human health and providing additional support to Niger for the outbreak response WHO is working with partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) to coordinate international support for the response. IFRC, and Unicef are supporting outbreak response.The NGO ALIMA and the Nigerian NGO BEFEN are providing support for case management and social mobilisation on the ground.Currently, in conjunction with the Ministry of Public Health, an entomological survey is being prepared for urgent implementation with WHO technical and financial support. This is to identify potential vectors for RVF in the region and it is considered to be in the definition of vector control activities.Currently, some of the main challenges include under-detection of human cases. The risk that only severe cases are being detected and reported cannot be ruled out. There is no national local capacity to test the specimens. For laboratory confirmation for RVF, the samples are being shipped to WHO regional collaborating centres. Moreover, to ascertain the extent of this outbreak, the involvement of the national livestock department is required.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Based on the available information, the event risk assessment is ongoing. The risk of further spread of outbreak within Niger and internationally (especially to neighbouring countries and those on the transhumance and migration routes) cannot be ruled out.Nomadic stockbreeders from Niger and neighbouring countries have just participated in the Cure Sal\u00e9e festival, a major annual mass gathering event from 23 to 25 September. During this festival, herds are brought to graze on the salty pastures ahead of the dry season. Around 2 million cattle and even more small ruminants were expected to be part of the event.At the end of the rainy season, as per known migration patterns, the nomadic human population along with their herds will progressively move to other Southern Sub Saharan countries and irrigation systems along the Niger river where pastures may still be available. In conjunction with the ongoing outbreak, the high density of animals in the area and the transhumance pattern significantly increases the risk of international spread. The security situation in the Sahel is unstable and also needs to be taken into consideration.",

        "Description of the Situation": "On 8 September 2016 the National IHR Focal Point for Austria notified WHO of a laboratory confirmed case of Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. This is the second case of MERS-CoV in Austria. (The first MERS-CoV case in Austria was notified on 30 September 2014).Details of the case reported are as followsThe patient is a 67 year old male visitor from Saudi Arabia (citizen and resident) who arrived in Vienna, Austria on 4 September 2016. The onset of symptoms (fever and cough) was on 6 September. The patient, who has an underlying condition, was hospitalized with severe pneumonia on 7 September, and he is currently in isolation in critical condition.MERS-CoV was confirmed on 8 September using real-time PCR (upE and ORF1b and N) by the reference laboratory in Vienna. The patient, who is a camel breeder, has confirmed contact with camel livestock in Saudi Arabia in the 14 days prior to symptom onset. The case had no contact with healthcare centers in Saudi Arabia in the 14 days prior to symptom onset.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "The National IHR Focal Point for Saudi Arabia has been informed by WHO. National IHR focal points for Austria and Saudi Arabia have initiated investigation and tracing of contacts in both countries. In addition, in Saudi Arabia, the Ministry of Agriculture has been informed and investigation of camels is ongoing. The camels have been sampled and are under quarantine.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Based on the current available information regarding this single case reported in Austria, there is a risk for serious public health impact given that MERS has caused severe human infections resulting in high case fatality rate and has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans especially in health care settings with the potential to lead to large scale outbreaks. This risk assessment will be revised as additional information becomes available.",
        "WHO Advice": "Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS-CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.",

        "Description of the Situation": "On 11 August 2016, the National Health and Family Planning Commission of China notified WHO of five additional cases of laboratory-confirmed human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus, including one death.Onset dates ranged from 24 June \u2013 29 July 2016, and three of the five cases are male. Cases ranged in age from 13 \u2013 79 years with a median age of 68 years (among cases reported so far, age range is from 0 \u2013 91 years, with a median age of 58 years). Two of the five cases reported exposure to live poultry, or were involved in the slaughter of poultry. There was no reported history of exposure to poultry for the other three cases. Cases were reported from two provinces (Fujian and Hebei) and one municipality (Beijing). Cases reported from Hebei and Beijing were reported to be family members. Investigations are on-going, at this stage human-to human-transmission cannot be ruled out, however to date no further transmission has been reported.A total of 798 laboratory-confirmed human cases with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported through IHR notification since early 2013.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "The Chinese Government has taken the following surveillance and control measures:strengthening outbreak surveillance and situation analysis;reinforcing all efforts on medical treatment; andconducting risk communication with the public and dissemination of information.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Most human cases are exposed to the A(H7N9) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, including live poultry markets. Since the virus continues to be detected in animals and environments, further human cases can be expected. Although small clusters of human cases with influenza A(H7N9) viruses have been reported including those involving healthcare workers, current epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans. Therefore further community level spread is considered unlikely.Human infections with the A(H7N9) virus are unusual and need to be monitored closely in order to identify changes in the virus and/or its transmission behaviour to humans as it may have a serious public health impact.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid poultry farms, contact with animals in live bird markets, entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travellers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, in order to ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005), and continue national health preparedness actions.",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 28 May 2016, the Ministry of Health of Kenya notified WHO of an outbreak of Chikungunya in Mandera East sub-county.The first reports of an increase in cases with febrile illness and joint pains occurred in May 2016. Samples were collected and shipped to the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) Arboviral Laboratory in Nairobi. On 16 May, KEMRI laboratory confirmed 7 of the 10 samples tested positive for Chikungunya virus. All samples tested negative for other arboviruses including: dengue, yellow fever and West Nile viruses.Moreover, from partial sequencing of the envelope gene it was observed that the CHIK isolates from Mandera are grouped with isolates from the post-2005 Indian Ocean islands, Asia and Europe. Full genome sequencing is underway.To date, KEMRI has received a total of 177 samples of suspected cases in the laboratory for testing. Of thse, 53 of these came from Somalia and rest from Mandera. 57 were positive by IgM antibody testing and 38 were positive for CHIK virus by RT-PCR. Of the positives, 9 were both IgM and PCR positive.As of 30 June 2016, 1,792 cases had been line listed. No deaths have been reported so far. However there is a risk of underreporting of cases since many patients are not reporting to health facilities. There have been outbreaks of Chikungunya in neighbouring Bula Hawa region in Somalia border region originating from Mogadishu. It is estimated that about 80% of the population and 50% of the health work force in Mandera town were affected by Chikungunya. Cases with severe debilitating joint pains were being managed as inpatients for a short duration for 1 or 2 days. However, the majority of the cases are not seeking treatment in health facilities.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "WHO country office supported the Ministry of Health to dispatch seven technical staff to support the County government of Mandera in risk assessment. WHO supported a rapid vector assessment survey, it was observed that most of the breeding habitats for the\u00a0Aedes\u00a0vectors for chikungunya in Mandera are within domiciliary containers mainly for water storage. The density of day-biting Aedes vectors were substantially high and County vector control activities were minimal.A cross border and coordination meeting between Somalia and Kenya took place on 30 May 2016 to coordinate joint response activities to control the outbreak. The meeting recommended a lead agency to coordinate response activities across the border and to improve coordinated surveillance and information sharing. Other partners who were part of the response included MSF and Kenya Red cross. MSF supplied 30,000 treated mosquito nets, which targeted about 30% coverage for the population at risk. The MOH also provided 5000 ITNs for hospital use and chemicals for vector control.The last outbreak of Chikungunya in Kenya was in 2004 and 2005, where at least 1,300 cases were documented. The affected areas were Lamu and Mombasa in the Coast region. A seroprevalence survey done in October 2004 suggested that 75% of the population in Lamu had been affected.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "In the past, the outbreak that began in 2004, on the Kenyan coast reached the Comoros at the end of 2004 before spreading to the Indian Ocean islands in 2005. A mutation in the E1 gene and selection chikungunya virus strains that increase adaptation of the virus to one of the vector\u00a0Aedes albopictus\u00a0and therefore significantly increase transmissibility has likely occurred in Reunion Island at the end of 2005 and resulted in an unprecedented outbreak and a further spread to the rest of the world.If confirmed the preliminary sequencing results the circulation of the mutated chikungunya stain could yield significantly higher attack rate than with the formerly circulating African strain.\u00a0Ae albopictus\u00a0is an invasive species that continues to expand geographically in various parts of the world, could therefore represent a further risk of geographical extension the current outbreak in the affected countries and beyond .The risk for a moderate to high scale outbreak of Chikungunya in the area cannot be ruled out due to the presence of the disease vector, immunologically naive population and potential upcoming rains in the area. Besides potential cross border span of the outbreak, under-reporting of cases and low levels of health seeking behaviours among the affected population is concerning.",

No history of travel outside Luanda has been reported. Investigation regarding potential source of infection is ongoing.The case had onset of symptoms (headache, fever, arthralgia and muscle pain) on 14 July 2016 in Angola. He sought medical treatment in a hospital in Angola, however his symptoms persisted, and he returned to China on 21 July 2016.By the time of arrival in Beijing he was already in a serious condition and he was transferred to a specialised hospital for treatment and placed under quarantine.On 23 July 2016, a sample from the case tested positive for RVF at the Beijing Municipal Center for Disease Prevention and Control (Beijing CDC) and was confirmed on the same day at the China Center for Disease Prevention and Control (China CDC). The National Health and Family Planning Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China convened an expert group on 23 July to review the patient\u2019s epidemiological history, clinical symptoms and laboratory results and it was concluded that the case is China\u2019s first imported case of RVF. The patient is currently in serious condition.",

        "WHO Risk Assessment": "RVF is a viral zoonosis that primarily affects animals but can also infect humans. The vast majority of human infections result from direct or indirect contact with the blood or organs of infected animals. Human infections have also resulted from the bites of infected mosquitoes and hematophagous (blood-feeding) flies. There is some evidence that humans can become infected with RVF by ingesting unpasteurized milk or uncooked meat from infected animals.Since there has been no documented human to human transmission of the virus to date, and appropriate vector control measures have been put in place in China, WHO assesses the risk for further disease transmission from a single imported case in China and/or from China to be low.",

        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "MERS-CoV causes severe human infections resulting in high mortality and has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings.The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to animals or animal products (for example, following contact with dromedaries) or human source (for example, in a health care setting). WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.",
        "WHO Advice": "Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS\u2010CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.WHO remains vigilant and is monitoring the situation. Given the lack of evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission in the community, WHO does not recommend travel or trade restrictions with regard to this event. Raising awareness about MERS-CoV among travellers to and from affected countries is good public health practice.",

        "Description of the Situation": "On 12 July 2016, the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) of China notified WHO of 7 additional laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus, including 4 deaths.Onset dates range from 26 May to 23 June. The cases range in age from 52 to 68 years, with a median age of 61 years. Of these 7 cases, 4 (57%) are male. The majority (5 cases, 71%) reported exposure to live poultry, slaughtered poultry or live poultry markets. One case has no history of exposure to poultry and the remaining case worked in a market where live poultry is sold. No human to human transmission was reported. Cases were reported from 6 provinces and municipalities: Tianjin (2), Anhui (1), Beijing (1), Jiangsu (1), Liaoning (1) and Zhejiang (1).",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "The Chinese Government has taken the following surveillance and control measures:strengthening outbreak surveillance and situation analysis;reinforcing all efforts on medical treatment; andconducting risk communication with the public and dissemination of information.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Most human cases are exposed to the A(H7N9) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, including live poultry markets. Since the virus continues to be detected in animals and environments, further human cases can be expected. Although small clusters of human cases with influenza A(H7N9) viruses have been reported previously including those involving healthcare workers, current epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans. Therefore, community level spread of this virus is considered unlikely for the time being.Human infections with the A(H7N9) virus are unusual and need to be monitored closely in order to identify changes in the virus and/or its transmission behaviour to humans as it may have a serious public health impact.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid poultry farms, contact with animals in live bird markets, entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travellers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, in order to ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005), and continue national health preparedness actions.",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 1 July 2016, the National IHR Focal Point for the United Kingdom notified WHO of an outbreak of Enterohaemorrhagic Shiga toxin-producing Escherischia coli (STEC) O157 PT34 in England and Wales.The increase in the notifications of E. coli O157 cases was first observed by the South West Public Health England (PHE) Centre on 21 June. An outbreak control team was convened on 22 June to investigate this increase and, on 24 June, the first samples associated with this increase were confirmed as STEC serogroup O157 phage type 34, positive for the eae (intimin) and verocytotoxin 2 genes but negative for the verocytotoxin 1 gene (hereafter referred to as 'the outbreak strain').On 27 June, a significant increase in the number of cases with the outbreak strain was observed nationally, and the incident was declared and managed as a national outbreak. Analysis of whole genome sequencing data confirmed that the isolates fall within the same cluster. The outbreak strain is not related to strains currently circulating amongst the UK bovine reservoir but rather closely related to sequences identified in people reporting recent travel to the Mediterranean region. This suggests that the outbreak strain is likely to be imported.As of 14 July, 158 cases had been identified, of which 105 had been classified as confirmed cases and 53 as probable. Four of these patients remain in hospital. Features of haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) have been reported in seven cases. Two cases have died, both of whom have E. coli infection listed as a causative factor. Cases are distributed throughout the UK, with the majority (91%) residing in England. The outbreak is characterised by multiple small clusters linked to catering and residential care premises. The proportion of hospitalised cases is high (40%). Cases are predominantly female (75%) and over the age of 18 (91%) \u2013 the age range is between 1 and 98 years. Onset dates for cases range from 31 May 2016 to 5 July 2016.Multiple analytical studies have provided evidence that consumption of mixed salad leaves, particularly from catering establishments such as cafes and restaurants, is associated with the infection. Sampling and microbiological examination of salad products is continuing although all results to date have been negative for STEC O157.",
        "Epidemiology": "Escherischia coli\u00a0(E. coli) is a bacterium that is commonly found in the gut of humans and warm-blooded animals. Most strains of\u00a0E. coli\u00a0are harmless; however, some strains, such as enterohaemorrhagic\u00a0E. coli, can cause severe foodborne disease.",
        "Public Health Response": "Control measures have been implemented by a small number of wholesalers to cease adding some imported leaves to their mixed salad products pending further investigations.PHE is working with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the Food Standards Agency and the European Commission to identify the source of the outbreak. PHE is also providing advice to the public and keeping them informed about the ongoing investigations.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "The outbreak was confirmed to have been caused by a particular strain of Shiga-toxin producing\u00a0E. coli\u00a0(STEC) O157 Phage type 34, although the source of the infection is yet to be identified. Even though Phage type 34 is the seventh most common phage type amongst STEC O157 isolates, with 734 cases detected between 1994 and 2016, on average not more than one case is reported per week, rising to 2.35 cases per week during spring and summer; therefore, the observed increase is significant. Similar increases have not been reported from other European countries and the same strain has not been reported outside of the United Kingdom indicating that, at present, the outbreak could be restricted to the UK. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessment based on the latest available information.",

        "Description of the Situation": "Since August 2016, suspected dengue fever cases and deaths have been reported in Ouagadougou, the capital city of Burkina Faso.From 5 August to 12 November 2016, a total of 1061 probable (Dengue Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) positive) cases out of 1266 suspected cases were reported with a cumulative total of 15 deaths (CFR 1.2%). All cases have been reported from all 12 districts of Ouagadougou.

Results for genetic sequencing are pending.",

        "Public Health Response": "The Ministry of Health (MoH) has established an integrated disease surveillance and response (IDSR) mechanism but dengue surveillance was not included. There is a plan to include dengue to increase the surveillance capacity.An initial investigation was performed between 24 to 28 October into six health facilities and further investigations are ongoing.Coordination is ensured by holding weekly meetings of the national epidemic management committee along with the health authorities and the other ministerial departments involved in the response.A response plan has been developed which includes vector control and risk communication.An update of dengue surveillance tools and guidelines for cases detection and management was carried out and tools were disseminated to individuals in the response.The Ministry of Health plans to strengthen the capacity of the national reference laboratory for viral haemorrhagic fevers, with additional support being deployed by IPD and WHO.Delivery and dissemination of dengue awareness, case management and preventive measures messages translated into different country's own official languages.The main hospitals in Ouagadougou are providing mosquito nets for the patients affected by severe dengue (for more information on severe dengue, see \u201cFact sheet on dengue\u201d).Free medical care and treatment for severe cases of dengue.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Dengue has occurred in the context of low establishment of dengue surveillance in Burkina Faso. Many health facilities do not have access to dengue RDT. Case definitions and case management guidelines are not sufficiently disseminated therefore healthcare workers are not well trained on dengue surveillance, specifically case detection and notification. Awareness of the disease among health care workers and prevention is lacking as the surveillance of this disease is not well established despite an IDSR mechanism.Although the rainy season has ended, the potential for a high density of mosquitoes is still present as vector breeding sites at household and community level are numerous. Discussions are ongoing among stakeholders and entomologists on vector control interventions in the community. Vector control measures should identify the most productive breeding sites (identify where most larval density is detected) and identify reduction measures with active support of the community should be initiated. Entomological monitoring in select sites should be carried out to assess impact of all control measures. The use of mosquito nets for hospitalised viraemic patients should be considered. In addition, prevention measures at the individual level should be taken.Furthermore, it is important to highlight that the focus for healthcare workers and the general public is malaria rather than dengue. Therefore, there is a need to strengthen early diagnosis capacity, community awareness through communication, social mobilization, community engagement interventions, vector control and to reinforce clinical management guidance to better respond to this outbreak.Ouagadougou is the capital of Burkina Faso with major roads routes and rail links to neighbouring countries and an international airport. Additionally, there is frequent movement of populations to and from neighbouring countries. Currently there is no evidence indicating dengue outbreaks in the neighbouring regions, however the prior circulation of dengue virus cannot be ruled out. Insufficient information is available to assess this risk.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO recommends that countries should only consider introduction of the dengue vaccine CYD-TDV in geographic settings (national or subnational) where epidemiological data indicate a high burden of disease. Currently there is insufficient evidence of a high prevalence of dengue in Burkina Faso, further investigations are required.Prevention of dengue through vector control methods such as mosquito habitat removal and use of insecticides (indoor space spraying and outdoor fogging), and prevention measures at individual level (use of repellents, wearing light coloured, long sleeved shirts and pants and ensuring rooms are fitted with screens to prevent mosquitoes from entering) are recommended.WHO does not recommend that any general travel or trade restrictions be applied on Burkina Faso based on the information available for this event.",

It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS\u2010CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.Given the lack of evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission in the community, WHO does not recommend travel or trade restrictions with regard to this event. Raising awareness about MERS-CoV among travellers to and from affected countries is good public health practice.",

        "Date Reported": "14 June 2016",
        "Location": "Angola",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 21 January 2016, the Ministry of Health of Angola notified WHO of an outbreak of yellow fever (YF). The first case (with onset date of 5 December 2015) was identified in Viana municipality, Luanda province. As of 10 June, 3,137 suspected cases, including 345 deaths, had been reported from all the 18 provinces of Angola. A total of 847 cases had been laboratory-confirmed. The confirmed cases are from 78 districts of 16 provinces. Local transmission has been documented in 31 districts of 12 provinces (Benguela, Cuango Cubango, Cuanza Norte, Cuanza Sul, Cunene, Huambo, Huila, Luanda, Lunda Norte, Malanje, Uige, and Zaire). Luanda and Huambo remain the most affected provinces with 1,778 cases (489 confirmed) and 508 cases (126 confirmed), respectively. The other most affected provinces are Benguela (291 suspected cases), Huila (135 suspected cases), Cuanza Sul (99 suspected cases) and Uige (54 suspected cases). The majority of the cases are aged 15 to 24 years.Efforts to strengthen surveillance are ongoing, and the number of cases in the country is slowly decreasing, though new clusters of cases are being reported in new districts. The epidemiological trend and pattern show that YF virus circulation continues to extend to other provinces and the risk for exportation to other countries with close linkages to Angola still exists. The epidemiological situation in Lunda Norte is of particular concern. This province shares borders with the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and regularly experiences a high flow of people and goods in and out of DRC. To date, three laboratory confirmed cases, imported from Lunda Norte, have been reported by DRC.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "The national task force is leading the response to the outbreak, under the National Director of Public Health (NDPH). WHO set up an Incident Management System (IMS) to coordinate international partners\u2019 support to the NDPH. The IMS integrates and coordinates the work of several organizations, including the Institut Pasteur of Dakar, UNICEF, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Medicos del Mundo and M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res.The IMS partner response to the outbreak is articulated around five pillars:strengthening surveillance, with a focus on case investigations and laboratory confirmationvaccination,vector control,case management, andsocial mobilization.As of June 10, almost half of the country had been vaccinated (10,641,209 people) and the country had received 11,635,800 vaccines. Mass vaccination campaigns have taken place in all the districts of Luanda, seven districts of Benguela, five districts of Cuanza Sul, five districts of Huambo, three districts of Huila, and two of Uige. Vaccination is ongoing in two districts of Lunda Norte and one in Zaire, all of which border DRC. Additional mass vaccination campaigns are being planned in these and other provinces, including Cuando Cubango, Cunene and Namibe. Reactive vaccination has taken place in Cafunfu town (Lunda Norte) and the city of Lubango (Huila), among others. Plans are under way to complete vaccination in areas with low vaccination coverage (so called \u2018mop up\u2019 campaigns) in Luanda and Benguela.WHO and partners are providing technical and financial support to the response. The current challenges include the need to strengthen the response to the outbreak at the provincial level and address border health issues.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "The evolution of the epidemiological situation in Angola is concerning and needs to be closely monitored. Based on experiences from previous similar events, it is expected that additional cases will be reported. The reports of YF imported cases in China, DRC, and Kenya demonstrate the threat that this outbreak constitutes to the entire world. Viraemic patients travelling to areas where competent vectors and susceptible human populations are present pose a risk for the establishment of local cycles of transmission. There is an urgent need to continue strengthening the quality of the response in Angola and to enhance preparedness in neighbouring countries and in countries that have diaspora communities in Angola. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessments based on the latest available information.",
        "WHO Advice": "Yellow fever can easily be prevented through immunization provided that vaccination is administered at least 10 days before travel. WHO, therefore, urges Members States especially those where the establishment of a local cycle of transmission is possible (i.e. where the competent vector is present) to strengthen the control of immunisation status of travellers to all potentially endemic areas.In the context of an ongoing YF outbreak in Angola, special attention should also be placed on travellers returning from Angola and other potentially endemic areas. If there are medical grounds for not getting vaccinated, this must be certified by the appropriate authorities.WHO does not recommend any restriction of travel and trade to Angola based on the current information available.",

        "Description of the Situation": "On 2 June 2016, the National IHR Focal Point of the United States of America notified PAHO/WHO of the first laboratory-confirmed case of locally-acquired Chikungunya virus in the state of Texas.The patient, who is from Cameron County, became ill in November 2015 and tested positive for the Chikungunya virus by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in January 2016. The diagnosis was confirmed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in May 2016. Unlike previously reported cases of Chikungunya virus among Texas residents, the patient had no recent history of travel. However, since the patient contracted the infection more than six months ago and the entomological investigations confirm the absence of chikungunya virus in local mosquitoes, the primary risk of infection for the USA at this time remains travel-related.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "To prevent the establishment of local transmission of CHIKV in Texas, the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS), in consultation with the U.S. CDC recommends the following actions, as time and resources allow, when a person known or suspected of having a Chikungunya virus infection is present in Texas:vector control,mosquito surveillance and testing,education.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "This is the second time that autochthonous circulation of chikungunya virus is reported in the United States: autochthonous circulation of chikungunya virus was first reported in the state of Florida in July 2014 (12 cases). The risk of large-scale outbreaks of Chikungunya virus in the United States is considered to be low. Nevertheless, given the presence of the competent vectors (Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus) in different areas of the United States as well as the occasional reporting of cases among incoming travellers, the possibility of the establishment of autochthonous cycles of transmission cannot be completely ruled out. Furthermore, there is a risk of extension of disease transmission to other countries where the competent vectors are present. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessment based on the latest available information.",
        "WHO Advice": "The proximity of mosquito vector breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for chikungunya virus infection. Prevention and control relies on reducing the breeding of mosquitoes through source reduction (removal and modification of breeding sites) and reducing contact between mosquitoes and people. This can be achieved by reducing the number of natural and artificial water-filled habitats that support mosquito larvae, reducing the adult mosquito populations around at-risk communities and by using barriers such as insect screens, closed doors and windows, long clothing and repellents. Since the Aedes mosquitoes (the primary vector for transmission) are day-biting mosquitoes, it is recommended that those who sleep during the daytime, particularly young children, the sick or elderly, should rest under mosquito nets (bed nets), treated with or without insecticide to provide protection.During outbreaks, space spraying of insecticides may be carried out following the technical orientation provided by WHO to kill flying mosquitoes. Suitable insecticides (recommended by the WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme) may also be used as larvicides to treat relatively large water containers, when this is technically indicated. Source reduction with active community support should be encouraged.Basic precautions for protection from mosquito bites should be taken by people traveling to high risk areas. These include use of repellents, wearing light colored, long sleeved shirts and pants and ensuring rooms are fitted with screens to prevent mosquitoes from entering.WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction to the United States of America based on the current information available.",

        "Description of the Situation": "On 25 January 2016, the National IHR Focal Point of Benin notified WHO of an outbreak of Lassa fever (see DON published on 19 February).On 23 May 2016, the Ministry of Health of Benin declared the end of the outbreak. The announcement came 42 days after the detection of the last Lassa fever case in the country (10 April 2016). A total of 54 suspected cases, including 28 deaths, were reported from eight regions: Borgou (31 cases, 16 deaths), Donga (7 cases, 5 deaths), Collines (6 cases, 3 deaths), Alibori (3 cases, 1 death), Plateau (3 cases, 2 deaths), Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 (2 cases, 1 death), Atlantique (1 case) and Littoral (1 case). Of these 54 suspected cases, 16 were laboratory-confirmed in three regions: Borgou (13 cases), Donga (2 cases), Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 (1 case). Five of the 54 suspected cases are health workers from the Borgou region. Three of these 5 health workers were laboratory-confirmed. Two of these 5 health workers passed away. During the course of this outbreak, five laboratories provided technical support for the confirmation of Lassa fever cases by polymerase chain reaction (PCR):Lassa Fever Research and Control Centre, Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital, Irrua, Edo state, Nigeria;Virology laboratory, Lagos University Teaching Hospital Lagos, Nigeria;Tropical medicine institute laboratory, Hamburg, Germany;Noguchi laboratory (WHO Collaborating centre), Ghana;Institut Pasteur (IP) Lyon, France.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "The Ministry of Health of Benin, with the support of WHO and partners, coordinated the management of the outbreak. Control measures were implemented, including field investigation, enhanced surveillance, case management, infection prevention and control, contact tracing and follow-up, and social mobilization.WHO deployed a multidisciplinary team in the affected areas to support the response.Since the beginning of the outbreak, a total of 739 contacts were identified and monitored. At present, 1 contact under follow-up was laboratory confirmed for Lassa fever infection.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "The current report confirms that, at present, there are no known Lassa fever transmission chains in Benin. Although Lassa fever is endemic in neighbouring Nigeria and other West African countries, this is only the second time that cases were reported in Benin (the first outbreak occurred in November 2014). This latest outbreak was characterized by a high number of deaths among confirmed cases. It is, therefore, of paramount importance to investigate the factors that contributed to this higher than expected mortality rate. Furthermore, to reduce the likelihood of flare-ups, countries in West Africa endemic for Lassa fever are encouraged to strengthen the related surveillance systems.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO does not recommend any restriction of travel and trade to Benin based on the information available.",

        "Description of the Situation": "On 30 May 2016, the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) of China notified WHO of one laboratory-confirmed case of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N6) virus.Details of the caseA 50-year-old male living in Xiangxi Autonomous Prefecture, Hunan Province developed symptoms on 23 May 2016. On 24 May, he visited a doctor in a village clinic, and on 28 May, was transferred to a hospital and was in critical condition at the time of reporting. The case was confirmed as A(H5N6) by laboratory testing, supplemented with clinical manifestation and epidemiology findings on 28 May. Close contacts of this case remain healthy. The investigation is ongoing.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "The Chinese Government has taken the following surveillance and control measures:strengthening surveillance, analysis and research;further enhancing the medical care of the case;conducting public risk communication and releasing information.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "This report does not change the overall public health risk associated with avian influenza A(H5N6) viruses. Although influenza A(H5N6) has caused severe infection in humans, until now human infections with the virus seem to be sporadic with no ongoing human to human transmission and close contacts of the case remain healthy. However, the characterization of this virus is ongoing and its implication to the evolution and emergence of a pandemic strain is unknown. The risk of international disease spread is considered to be low at this point in time. WHO continues to assess the epidemiological situation and conduct further risk assessment based on the latest information.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid poultry farms, contact with animals in live bird markets, entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travellers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, in order to ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005), and continue national health preparedness actions.",

        "Location": "Peru",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 2 May 2016, the Ministry of Health of Peru reported 57 cases of Oropouche fever. The majority of cases are from towns located in the northern part of the Cusco Region, which is situated in the Amazon rainforest.Most cases (79%) were detected in January, with only 7% and 14% of the cases being identified in February and March, respectively. To date, there have been no fatalities and all cases have recovered following symptomatic treatment.In February 2016, a field mission to the Madre de Dios Region conducted jointly by the MoH of Peru and PAHO/WHO revealed a mixed outbreak of dengue (DENV-2) and Oropouche viruses. While Madre de Dios already experienced an outbreak of Oropouche fever in 1994, at the time of the mission in February, this latest outbreak was of a higher magnitude (120 confirmed cases).",
        "Epidemiology": "Oropouche fever is caused by the Oropouche virus. In humans, it is transmitted primarily through the bite of the Culicoides paraensis midge. No direct transmission of the virus from human to human has been documented.Oropouche fever causes symptoms similar to those of dengue with an incubation period of 4-8 days (range: 3-12 days). Symptoms include the sudden onset of high fever, headache, myalgia, joint pain, and vomiting. In some patients it can cause clinical symptoms of aseptic meningitis.In the Americas, outbreaks of Oropouche fever virus have been reported from rural and urban communities of Brazil, Ecuador, Panama, Peru, and Trinidad and Tobago.",
        "Public Health Response": "Peruvian health authorities have implemented the following public health measures:providing medical treatment to the cases;conducting epidemiological and entomological investigations;strengthening vector control.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Cases of infection with Oropouche virus have already been reported in the past in Peru. However, it is the first time that the Cusco Region records cases of Oropouche fever. It will be critical to establish whether the competent vector, the Culicoides paraensis midge, is present in Cusco as that could provide some explanation for the emergence of the disease in this specific area. At present, the possibility of further cases being detected in the Cusco Region and in the rest of Peru cannot be excluded. Given the wide geographical distribution of the competent vector in the Region of the Americas, the risk of cases being identified in other countries is significant. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessments based on the latest available information.",
        "WHO Advice": "Given its clinical presentation, Oropouche fever should be included in the clinical differential diagnosis for other common arboviral diseases (e.g., chikungunya, dengue, yellow fever, Zika virus).The proximity of midge vector breeding to human habitation is a significant risk factor for Oropouche virus infection. Prevention and control relies on reducing the breeding of midges through source reduction (removal and modification of breeding sites) and reducing contact between midges and people. This can be achieved by reducing the number of natural and artificial water-filled habitats that support midge larvae, reducing the adult midge populations around at-risk communities and by using barriers such as insect screens, closed doors and windows, long clothing and repellents.",

        "Location": "Democratic Republic of the Congo",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 22 March 2016, the National IHR Focal Point of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) notified WHO of cases of yellow fever (YF) in connection with an ongoing outbreak in Angola (see DON posted on 13 April 2016).As of 31 May, a total of 700 suspected cases, including 63 deaths, had been reported from all the provinces by the national surveillance system. Samples were collected from 689 cases and sent for laboratory confirmation to the National Institute of Biomedical Research (INRB) in Kinshasa and the Pasteur Institute (IP) in Dakar, Senegal. To date, a total of 52 cases have been laboratory-confirmed for YF. The 52 confirmed cases are from five provinces: Kongo Central (36 cases), Kinshasa (11 cases), Kwango (3 cases), Bas U\u00e9l\u00e9 (1 case) and Tshuapa (1 case). The two cases from Bas U\u00e9l\u00e9 and Tshuapa are sylvatic and not related to the outbreak in Angola. Two of the 52 confirmed cases were classified as autochthonous and were reported from the provinces of Kinshasa and Kongo Central. The remaining 46 confirmed cases were classified as imported from Angola and were detected in the provinces of Kongo Central (34 cases), Kinshasa (9 cases) and Kwango (3 cases).",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "In response to the outbreak, a national coordination committee has been activated. This will include five sub-committees for reactive vaccination, surveillance and laboratory, vector control, social mobilization, and case management.Suspected cases of YF continue to be investigated on a daily basis. On 12 May, with the support of IP Dakar, national authorities set up a mobile laboratory in DRC to accelerate case confirmation. On 26 May, a reactive campaign vaccination began with a target of 1,983,597 people from 9 health zones in Kongo Central and 2 health zones in Kinshasa. The International Coordinating Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision approved the vaccine request for DRC and released 2,200,000 doses of vaccines and operational fund for the campaign.WHO classified the outbreak as a Grade 2 Emergency in accordance with the Emergency Response Framework (ERF). WHO has deployed a multidisciplinary team in Kongo Central and in Kinshasa to provide technical support to national authorities. The WHO Country Office has finalized a plan to mobilize further technical and financial resources for the control of the outbreak.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "DRC is located in a geographical area known to be at risk for YF transmission. Although cases are regularly reported, YF outbreaks in high population density areas are unusual. The confirmation of cases in Kinshasa and in other provinces highlights the risk of further spread of YF in DRC. Additional cases of local transmission are to be expected in the country due to the continuous importation of YF cases from Angola, the currently insufficient YF vaccination coverage, ecological factors and high vector density. Furthermore, there is a risk for the disease to spread to neighbouring countries because of heavy population movements in and out of DRC. It is, therefore, of paramount importance that national authorities in DRC implement adequate disease control and surveillance measures, especially reactive vaccination campaigns and cross border interventions, in order to avoid further spread of the disease. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessment based on the latest available information.",
        "WHO Advice": "Yellow fever can easily be prevented by immunization provided vaccination is administered at least 10 days before travel. WHO urges Members States especially those where the establishment of a local cycle of transmission is possible (i.e. where the competent vector is present) to strengthen the control of immunisation status of travellers to all potentially endemic areas.WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction to DRC based on the current information available.",

Of these, 165 cases and 89 deaths have been confirmed through laboratory testing (CFR: 53.9%). The cases were reported from 23 states in Nigeria.Since August 2015, ten health care workers (HCW) have been infected with Lassa fever virus, of which two have died. Of these ten cases, four were nosocomial infections. As of 17 May 2016, 8 states are currently reporting Lassa fever cases (suspected, probable, and confirmed), deaths and/or following of contacts for the maximum 21-day incubation period. Currently, 248 contacts are being followed up in the country. The other 15 previously affected states have completed the 42-day period following last known possible transmission.",

All the samples were also tested for Ebola, Dengue, Yellow fever and so far have tested negative. The two laboratories that are currently operational are:Virology laboratory, Lagos University Teaching HospitalLassa fever research and control centre, Irrua specialist hospitalAlong with other key partners, WHO is supporting ministry of health in surveillance and response of Lassa fever outbreaks including contacts tracing, follow up and community mobilization. One of a concern since the onset of Lassa fever outbreaks is the high proportion of deaths among the cases that is still under investigation.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Overall, the Lassa fever outbreak in Nigeria shows a declining trend. Considering the seasonal peaks in previous years, improvements in community and health care worker awareness, preparedness and general response activities, the risk of a larger-scale outbreak is low. Nevertheless, close monitoring, active case search, contact tracing, laboratory support and disease awareness (both in community in general and specific training for health care workers) should continue.",
        "WHO Advice": "Considering the seasonal flare ups of cases during this time of the year, countries in West Africa that are endemic for Lassa fever are encouraged to strengthen their related surveillance systems.Health-care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed Lassa fever should apply extra infection control measures to prevent contact with the patient\u2019s blood and body fluids and contaminated surfaces or materials such as clothing and bedding. When in close contact (within 1 metre) of patients with Lassa fever, health-care workers should wear face protection (a face shield or a medical mask and goggles), a clean, non-sterile long-sleeved gown, and gloves (sterile gloves for some procedures).Laboratory workers are also at risk. Samples taken from humans and animals for investigation of Lassa virus infection should be handled by trained staff and processed in suitably equipped laboratories under maximum biological containment conditions.The diagnosis of Lassa fever should be considered in febrile patients returning from areas where Lassa fever is endemic. Health-care workers seeing a patient suspected to have Lassa fever should immediately contact local and national experts for advice and to arrange for laboratory testing.WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction to Nigeria based on the current information available.",

        "Description of the Situation": "Between late December 2015 and early May 2016, the National IHR Focal of South Sudan notified WHO of an outbreak of haemorrhagic fever syndrome.As of 9 May, a total of 51 suspected cases, including 10 deaths, had been reported from the counties of Aweil North (45 cases, including 10 deaths) and Aweil West (6 cases). No health care workers had been reported among the cases. The majority (74.5%) of the suspected cases are below 20 years of age. The last recorded death dates back to 28 February.The most frequent symptoms include unexplained bleeding, fever, fatigue, headache and vomiting. The symptoms do not seem to be severe and rapidly resolve following supportive treatment. Currently, there is no evidence of person-to-person transmission of the disease. Samples of 33 patients were shipped to WHO collaborating centres in Uganda (Uganda Virus Research Institute), Senegal (Institut Pasteur of Dakar) and South Africa (National Institute for Communicable Diseases). The samples were tested by plaque reduction neutralization test, polymerase chain reaction or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. All samples were negative for Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, Ebola virus disease, Marburg virus disease, Rift Valley fever, yellow fever, West Nile virus and Zika virus; 5 samples tested positive for Onyong-nyong virus; 3 samples were positive for Chikungunya; and 1 sample tested positive for dengue virus. Further laboratory testing is ongoing that may confirm the causative agent. Other causes under investigation include bacterial diseases (e.g., Leptospirosis) and food intoxication (mycotoxines). Ecological risk factors for arboviral disease transmission were identified in the affected areas.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "With support from WHO, national authorities have conducted a number of public health activities, including investigating and managing all newly reported suspected cases, strengthening infection prevention and control as well as improving disease surveillance. Furthermore, community meetings have been conducted to raise people\u2019s awareness of haemorrhagic fever. Finally, in response to a request from the WHO Country Office, laboratory supplies have been mobilized by the WHO Regional Office for Africa.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "The laboratory results received so far do not explain the symptomatology (unexplained bleeding) of the reported cases nor the high mortality rate. Since the underlying cause of this public health event remains unknown, close monitoring and further epidemiological investigation is needed.The area where the outbreak is occurring borders Darfur in Sudan where at least 469 cases of undiagnosed viral haemorrhagic fever, including 120 deaths, were reported between August and November 2015.

Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travellers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, in order to ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005), and continue national health preparedness actions.",

On 1 May, the patient reported having frequent exposure to dromedaries as part of his work. He tested positive for MERS-CoV on 2 May and 3 May. The patient has no other comorbid conditions and no history of exposure to the other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to onset of symptoms. He is currently in stable condition, admitted to a negative pressure isolation room. The Department of Health Protection and Communicable Disease Control in the Ministry of Public Health has immediately carried out case investigation and contact tracing activities. Samples were collected from household contacts and health care workers. All tested negative for MERS-CoV.Contacts will be followed up until the end of the 14-day monitoring period following the last exposure to the case. Health education messages about appropriate preventive measures were shared with all contacts and they were advised to comply with the recommended preventive measure against MERS-CoV infection, and to report to the health authorities on the development of any respiratory symptoms. Infection prevention and control measures in all health facilities have been reinforced by the Ministry of Public Health.The Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources has been notified and investigation of the dromedaries is ongoing.Globally, since September 2012, WHO has been notified of 1,729 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 624 related deaths.",

It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS\u2010CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.Given the lack of evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission in the community, WHO does not recommend travel or trade restrictions with regard to this event. Raising awareness about MERS-CoV among travellers to and from affected countries is good public health practice.",

        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Despite the sale and distribution of small turtles in the United States has been banned since 1975, Salmonella outbreaks linked to pet turtles have been recorded in the United States. Turtles are a known cause of human Salmonella infections in the United States, particularly in infants and young children - in this outbreak most illnesses are infants and young children.Since the infection is linked to exposure to small turtles that have been exported internationally, there is a risk to paediatric populations in other countries.

        "Description of the Situation": "On 19 April 2016, the Department of Health, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region notified WHO of a confirmed, imported case of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus.The patient is an 80-year-old man with underlying illnesses, travelled to Dongguan, Guangdong province from 1 to 5 April. He developed productive cough, headache and a gout attack on 6 April. On 14 April, he developed fever, and by 17 April was experiencing disorientation. He went to hospital the same day and was subsequently admitted for management of pneumonia. On 19 April, he tested positive for avian influenza A(H7N9) virus following laboratory testing at the Public Health Laboratory Services Branch of the Centre for Health Protection (CHP). The patient is now in stable condition and will be transferred to a different hospital for further management Initial investigations by the CHP revealed that the patient had purchased a live chicken from a wet market close to where he stayed during his time in Mainland China. He slaughtered the chicken on 3 April.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "The Centre for Health Protection of the Department of Health is continuing investigation, as well as tracing and monitoring close contacts of the case.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Most human cases are exposed to the A(H7N9) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, including live poultry markets. Since the virus continues to be detected in animals and environments, further human cases can be expected. Although small clusters of human cases with influenza A(H7N9) viruses have been reported including those involving healthcare workers, current epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans. Therefore further community level spread is considered unlikely.Human infections with the A(H7N9) virus are unusual and need to be monitored closely in order to identify changes in the virus and/or its transmission behaviour to humans as it may have a serious public health impact.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid poultry farms, contact with animals in live bird markets, entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travellers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, in order to ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005), and continue national health preparedness actions.",

To date, a total of 11 laboratory-confirmed YF cases imported from Angola have been reported in China.The tenth imported case is an 18-year-old male from Fujian Province, China, who had been living in Angola. On 12 March, he had onset of fever and other symptoms, and visited a local hospital in Angola. On 27 March 2016, the patient travelled to Fuzhou City, Fujian Province, China via Dubai, United Arab Emirates and Beijing, China. He was afebrile on arrival in China. On 28 March, the patient sought medical care. Yellow fever infection was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at the Fujian International Travel Health Centre. Test results were corroborated by the Fujian Centers for Disease Control (CDC). The patient was hospitalised in Fuzhou and remains under treatment. The eleventh imported case is a 29-year-old male from Jiangsu Province, China, who had been working in Angola. On 5 April, he had onset of fever and other symptoms, and sought medical care at a local hospital in Angola. On 9 April, the patient was reported to have tested positive for YF in Angola by PCR. He flew back to China via Dubai, arriving in Beijing on 10 April. On arrival, the patient was transferred by ambulance to a hospital. His sample was tested at Beijing CDC and found to be positive for YF by PCR. On 12 April, expert consultation organised by the Beijing Health and Family Planning Commission confirmed the patient as an imported YF case based on the epidemiological history, clinical manifestations and laboratory findings. The case is currently stable.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "The Chinese government has taken the following measures:intensifying multi-sectoral coordination and collaboration,strengthening surveillance, vector monitoring and risk assessment,enhancing clinical management of yellow fever cases,conducting vector control activities,carrying out public risk communication activities,deploying a medical team to Angola to provide yellow fever vaccination to unvaccinated Chinese nationals.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "The report of yellow fever infection in non-immunized travellers returning from a country where vaccination against the disease is mandatory underlines the need to reinforce the implementation of vaccination requirements, in accordance with the International Health Regulations (2005). Furthermore, this report highlights the risk of international spread of yellow fever through non-immunized travellers. However, the risk of establishment of a local cycle of transmission in China is low due to the current climatic condition, which is unfavourable for the competent vector, the Aedes aegypti mosquito. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessment based on the latest available information.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO urges Members States especially those where the establishment of a local cycle of transmission is possible (i.e. where the competent vector is present) to strengthen the control of immunisation status of travellers to all potentially endemic areas.WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction to China based on the current information available.",

Cases were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The following are the results by year:no Zika virus positive results were identified among 64 samples tested in 2014,1 sample collected during a malaria outbreak in Morobe in May 2015 (a total of 34 samples were tested), 2 samples collected during a dengue outbreak in Western province in December 2015 (a total of 21 samples were tested), and 3 samples collected during a dengue outbreak in Kiunga in February 2016 (a total of 60 samples were tested). None of the patients positive for Zika virus had travelled outside Papua New Guinea prior to their illness.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "A press release of the event has been released to inform the public of the situation, raise awareness and provide measures for preventing mosquito bites and clean-up of mosquito breeding sites. Other tools that have been used to raise public awareness include radio, TV, newspaper articles, and a combined dengue/Zika prevention poster. The National Department of Health has also directly communicated with health workers to describe the clinical features of Zika virus and enhance surveillance for Zika virus infection, microcephaly and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "This report is important because it provides evidence on the circulation of Zika virus infection in Papua New Guinea in recent years. Although the results of the investigation suggest low levels of Zika virus transmission, the possibility of the occurrence of new cases in Papua New Guinea cannot be ruled out.The overall risk assessment remains unchanged. The risk of a global spread of Zika virus to areas where the competent vectors, the Aedes mosquitoes, are present is significant given the wide geographical distribution of these mosquitoes in various regions of the world. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessment based on the latest available information.",
        "WHO Advice": "The proximity of mosquito vector breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for Zika virus infection. Prevention and control relies on reducing the breeding of mosquitoes through source reduction (removal and modification of breeding sites) and reducing contact between mosquitoes and people. This can be achieved by reducing the number of natural and artificial water-filled habitats that support mosquito larvae, reducing the adult mosquito populations around at-risk communities and by using barriers such as insect screens, closed doors and windows, long clothing and repellents. Since the Aedes mosquitoes (the primary vector for transmission) are day-biting mosquitoes, it is recommended that those who sleep during the daytime, particularly young children, the sick or elderly, should rest under mosquito nets (bed nets), treated with or without insecticide to provide protection. Mosquito coils or other insecticide vaporizers may also reduce the likelihood of being bitten.During outbreaks, space spraying of insecticides may be carried out following the technical orientation provided by WHO to kill flying mosquitoes. Suitable insecticides (recommended by the WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme) may also be used as larvicides to treat relatively large water containers, when this is technically indicated.Basic precautions for protection from mosquito bites should be taken by people traveling to high risk areas, especially pregnant women. These include use of repellents, wearing light colored, long sleeved shirts and pants and ensuring rooms are fitted with screens to prevent mosquitoes from entering.Although the risk of transmission of Zika virus through sexual activity is considered to be very limited, based on precautionary principles, WHO recommends the following:All patients (male and female) with Zika virus infection and their sexual partners (particularly pregnant women) should receive information about the potential risks of sexual transmission of Zika virus, contraceptive measures and safer sexual practices, and should be provided with condoms when feasible. Women who have had unprotected sex and do not wish to become pregnant because of concern with infection with Zika virus should also have ready access to emergency contraceptive services and counselling.Sexual partners of pregnant women, living in or returning from areas where local transmission of Zika virus is known to occur, should use safer sexual practices or abstinence from sexual activity for the duration of the pregnancy.As most Zika virus infections are asymptomatic:Men and women living in areas where local transmission of Zika virus is known to occur should consider adopting safer sexual practices or abstaining from sexual activity.Men and women returning from areas where local transmission of Zika virus is known to occur should adopt safer sexual practices or consider abstinence for at least four weeks after return.Independently of considerations regarding Zika virus, WHO always recommends the use of safer sexual practices, including the correct and consistent use of condoms to prevent HIV, other sexually transmitted infections and unwanted pregnancies.WHO does not recommend routine semen testing to detect Zika virus.WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction to Papua New Guinea based on the current information available.",

This is the country\u2019s first case of Zika virus infection.The case is a 32-year-old woman from Lima province, with onset of symptoms on 28 March. The patient had no history of travel outside of Peru. Prior to her illness onset, she had unprotected sexual contact with her partner, who had recently returned from a trip to a Zika-affected country (from 26 February to 14 March). The partner had onset of symptoms on 16 March. Serum, urine and semen samples taken from the partner were tested at the National Institute for Health and resulted positive for Zika virus by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Serum and urine samples collected from the woman on 30 March and on 6 April, respectively, tested positive by RT-PCR at the National Institute of Health. No mosquito vectors were identified during the entomological investigation conducted in the patient\u2019s area of residence.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "Health authorities in Peru are taking the following measures:providing advice to travellers to areas where Zika virus is circulating to seek medical assistance, if presenting symptoms associated with Zika virus infection after return;enhancing epidemiological surveillance to promptly detect imported or autochthonous cases;conducting entomological surveillance.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Sporadic cases of infection acquired following sexual activity have already been reported in the past. These cases of sexual transmission do not change the overall risk assessment since the virus continues to be primarily transmitted to people through mosquito bites. The risk of a global spread of Zika virus to areas where the competent vectors, the Aedes mosquitoes, are present is significant, given the wide geographical distribution of these mosquitoes in various regions of the world. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessment based on the latest available information.",
        "WHO Advice": "The proximity of mosquito vector breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for Zika virus infection. Prevention and control relies on reducing the breeding of mosquitoes through source reduction (removal and modification of breeding sites) and reducing contact between mosquitoes and people. This can be achieved by reducing the number of natural and artificial water-filled habitats that support mosquito larvae, reducing the adult mosquito populations around at-risk communities and by using barriers such as insect screens, closed doors and windows, long clothing and repellents. Since the Aedes mosquitoes (the primary vector for transmission) are day-biting mosquitoes, it is recommended that those who sleep during the daytime, particularly young children, the sick or elderly, should rest under mosquito nets (bed nets), treated with or without insecticide to provide protection. Mosquito coils or other insecticide vaporizers may also reduce the likelihood of being bitten.During outbreaks, space spraying of insecticides may be carried out following the technical orientation provided by WHO to kill flying mosquitoes. Suitable insecticides (recommended by the WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme) may also be used as larvicides to treat relatively large water containers, when this is technically indicated.Basic precautions for protection from mosquito bites should be taken by people traveling to high risk areas, especially pregnant women. These include use of repellents, wearing light colored, long sleeved shirts and pants and ensuring rooms are fitted with screens to prevent mosquitoes from entering.Although the risk of transmission of Zika virus through sexual activity is considered to be very limited, based on precautionary principles, WHO recommends the following:All patients (male and female) with Zika virus infection and their sexual partners (particularly pregnant women) should receive information about the potential risks of sexual transmission of Zika virus, contraceptive measures and safer sexual practices, and should be provided with condoms when feasible. Women who have had unprotected sex and do not wish to become pregnant because of concern with infection with Zika virus should also have ready access to emergency contraceptive services and counselling.Sexual partners of pregnant women, living in or returning from areas where local transmission of Zika virus is known to occur, should use safer sexual practices or abstinence from sexual activity for the duration of the pregnancy.As most Zika virus infections are asymptomatic:Men and women living in areas where local transmission of Zika virus is known to occur should consider adopting safer sexual practices or abstaining from sexual activity.Men and women returning from areas where local transmission of Zika virus is known to occur should adopt safer sexual practices or consider abstinence for at least four weeks after return.Independently of considerations regarding Zika virus, WHO always recommends the use of safer sexual practices, including the correct and consistent use of condoms to prevent HIV, other sexually transmitted infections and unwanted pregnancies.WHO does not recommend routine semen testing to detect Zika virus.WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction to Peru based on the current information available.",

        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "MERS-CoV causes severe human infections resulting in high mortality and has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings.The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to animals or animal products (for example, following contact with dromedaries) or human source (for example, in a health care setting). WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.",
        "WHO Advice": "Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS\u2010CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.Given the lack of evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission in the community, WHO does not recommend travel or trade restrictions with regard to this event. Raising awareness about MERS-CoV among travellers to and from affected countries is good public health practice.",

The first case with onset date on 5 December 2015 was identified in Viana municipality, Luanda province.As of 7 April 2016, a total of 1,708 suspected cases, including 238 deaths (CFR: 13.9%), had been reported from 16 of the country\u2019s 18 provinces. Luanda remains the most affected province with 1,135 cases (405 confirmed), including 165 deaths (CFR: 14. 5%). The other most affected provinces are Huambo (266 suspected cases, 37 deaths), Huila (95 suspected cases, 16 deaths) and Benguela (51 suspected cases, 0 deaths). Between 6 and 7 April, 30 new suspected cases, including 4 deaths, were reported across the country \u2013 19 of these suspected cases and 2 of the reported deaths came from Luanda.A total of 581 cases have been laboratory confirmed in 59 districts of 12 provinces. Luanda province, the epicentre of the outbreak, accounts for 70% of the confirmed cases (405 cases). Other provinces with a high number of confirmed cases include Huambo (73 cases), Huila (27 cases), Benguela (22 cases) and Kuanza Sul (11 cases). From 6 to 7 April, 30 new confirmed cases were reported from Luanda (19), Huambo (4), Cuanza Sul (2), Cunene (2), Bengo (1), Lunda Norte (1) and Uige (1). The number of laboratory confirmed cases in provinces other than Luanda continues to increase. The risk of spread to other provinces and to neighbouring countries remains very high.Transmission of the disease is no longer restricted to Luanda. As of 7 April 2016, the National Final Classification Committee had confirmed local transmission in five other provinces (Benguela, Cuanza Sul, Huambo, Huila and Uige) and in a total of 10 districts.In addition, international spread of the disease has already been documented. Recent imported cases of YF have in fact been detected in China, Kenya and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) (see DONs published on 11 and 6 April).",

        "Public Health Response": "A national task force established by the government of Angola is leading the response to the outbreak. On 29 March, WHO graded the outbreak as a level 2 emergency on the Emergency Response Framework (ERF) grading scale \u2013 the ERF grading scale has three levels. WHO and partner organizations, including UNICEF, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) and Medicos del Mundo, are providing assistance with the coordination of the response. An incident manager has been appointed at WHO and 65 WHO multidisciplinary experts have been deployed to provide high-level technical support to the country.Between 3 and 6 April, the WHO Director General, the WHO Regional Director for Africa and the WHO AFRO Health Security and Emergencies cluster Director visited Angola to assess the ongoing response and provide high-level leadership support. The delegation met the Minister of Health, other Government Officials and His Excellency the President of the Republic of Angola. Decisions were made to take necessary measures to end the outbreak by 15 May 2016.Interventions are ongoing to enhance surveillance. These include epidemiological investigation, data management, early detection and confirmation of cases as well as final classification of cases by an established classification committee. Experts from Cuba are providing technical support to the country with the training of vector control specialists.The immunization campaign in Luanda, which started on 2 February in Viana municipality, has been completed in 7 out of the province\u2019s 12 districts and is still ongoing in the remaining five districts. As of 7 April, a total of 5,892,901 (90%) people had been vaccinated in Luanda. Preparation has started for the upcoming yellow fever vaccination campaign in 2 districts of Huambo and 3 of Benguela. On 7 April, the International Coordinating Group (ICG) for Vaccine Provision released 1.9 million vaccine doses. The social mobilization activities are being reinforced. Radio, TV and other media are being used to raise public awareness and encourage people to get vaccinated, with a special focus on vulnerable areas in all districts of Luanda.The United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) has approved a request of 3 million dollars to support the purchase of vaccines. In addition, the government of Angola has committed 15 million USD for the purchase of the yellow fever vaccine in addition to the payment of the 50% of the cost of the vaccines already received for the province of Luanda.Current challenges include the need of vaccines to complete reactive immunization, the control of the geographical spread of the outbreak within the country and to neighbouring countries. There also needs for more operational funds, adequate and sufficient vector control interventions to improve response activities in the other provinces. A close follow-up of preparedness measures in neighbouring countries is required to ensure the timely detection and management of any imported cases.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "The evolution of the situation in Angola is concerning and needs to be closely monitored. The reports of imported cases of YF in China, DRC and Kenya demonstrate that this outbreak constitutes a potential threat for the entire world. There is a risk for the further spread of the disease in view of the large international communities residing in Angola and the frequent travel activities with neighbouring and overseas countries. Furthermore, all countries where the mosquito vector (Aedes species) is present are at risk, notably those endemic for or previously affected by outbreaks of Dengue, Chikungunya or Zika virus and other arboviruses. Therefore, there is an urgent need to strengthen the quality of the response in Angola and to enhance preparedness activities in neighbouring countries and in countries that have diaspora communities in Angola. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessment based on the latest available information.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO urges Members States especially those where the establishment of a local cycle of transmission is possible (i.e., where the Aedes mosquitoes are present) to strengthen the control of immunization status of travellers to all potentially endemic areas and the surveillance of potential YF cases.In the context of an ongoing YF outbreak in Angola, special attention should also be placed on travellers returning from Angola and other potentially endemic areas. Travellers, particularly those arriving in Asia from Africa or Latin America should always have a certificate of YF vaccination. If there are medical grounds for not getting vaccinated, the International Health Regulations (2005) state that this must be certified by the appropriate authorities.WHO does not recommend any restriction of travel and trade to Angola based on the current information available.",

        "Description of the Situation": "On 5 April 2016, the National IHR Focal Point of Viet Nam notified WHO of 2 confirmed cases of locally-acquired Zika virus infection.The first case, a resident of Nha Trang, Viet Nam, had onset of fever, rash, conjunctivitis and headache on 26 March 2016. On 31 March, the case tested positive for Zika virus infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at Pasteur Institute Nha Trang. On 4 April the result was confirmed by the Pasteur Institute Ho Chi Minh City and National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology.The second case, a resident of Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam, developed rash, conjunctivitis and malaise on 29 March 2016. On 31 March the case tested positive for Zika virus infection by PCR at Pasteur Institute Ho Chi Minh City. On 2 April the result was confirmed by the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology, and again on 4 April by the Nagasaki University. As of 4 April, the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology and Pasteur Institutes of Ho Chi Minh City and Nha Trang have tested 1,215 samples collected from people with Zika virus symptoms from 32 provinces in Viet Nam. No other cases of Zika virus infection have yet been identified.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "Health authorities in Viet Nam are taking the following measures:strengthening disease surveillance and vector control activities;implementing risk communication activities, and provide information on measures for prevention and control of Zika virus and other mosquito borne diseases;implementing measures for monitoring the health status of pregnant women and detecting possible foetal complications of Zika virus infection;supporting medical facilities, including obstetric and paediatric units to prepare for a potential increase in the demand of health care services;ensuring adequate resource allocation for Zika prevention and control activities.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "These are the first autochthonous cases of Zika virus infection detected in Viet Nam in 2016. This report does not change the overall risk assessment. The risk of a global spread of Zika virus to areas where the competent vectors, the Aedes mosquitoes, are present is significant given the wide geographical distribution of these mosquitoes in various regions of the world. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.",
        "WHO Advice": "The proximity of mosquito vector breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for Zika virus infection. Prevention and control relies on reducing the breeding of mosquitoes through source reduction (removal and modification of breeding sites) and reducing contact between mosquitoes and people. This can be achieved by reducing the number of natural and artificial water-filled habitats that support mosquito larvae, reducing the adult mosquito populations around at-risk communities and by using barriers such as insect screens, closed doors and windows, long clothing and repellents. Since the Aedes mosquitoes (the primary vector for transmission) are day-biting mosquitoes, it is recommended that those who sleep during the daytime, particularly young children, the sick or elderly, should rest under mosquito nets (bed nets), treated with or without insecticide to provide protection. Mosquito coils or other insecticide vaporizers may also reduce the likelihood of being bitten.During outbreaks, space spraying of insecticides may be carried out following the technical orientation provided by WHO to kill flying mosquitoes. Suitable insecticides (recommended by the WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme) may also be used as larvicides to treat relatively large water containers, when this is technically indicated.Basic precautions for protection from mosquito bites should be taken by people traveling to high risk areas, especially pregnant women. These include use of repellents, wearing light colored, long sleeved shirts and pants and ensuring rooms are fitted with screens to prevent mosquitoes from entering.Although the risk of transmission of Zika virus through sexual activity is considered to be very limited, based on precautionary principles, WHO recommends the following:All patients (male and female) with Zika virus infection and their sexual partners (particularly pregnant women) should receive information about the potential risks of sexual transmission of Zika virus, contraceptive measures and safer sexual practices, and should be provided with condoms when feasible. Women who have had unprotected sex and do not wish to become pregnant because of concern with infection with Zika virus should also have ready access to emergency contraceptive services and counselling.Sexual partners of pregnant women, living in or returning from areas where local transmission of Zika virus is known to occur, should use safer sexual practices or abstinence from sexual activity for the duration of the pregnancy.As most Zika virus infections are asymptomatic:Men and women living in areas where local transmission of Zika virus is known to occur should consider adopting safer sexual practices or abstaining from sexual activity.Men and women returning from areas where local transmission of Zika virus is known to occur should adopt safer sexual practices or consider abstinence for at least four weeks after return.Independently of considerations regarding Zika virus, WHO always recommends the use of safer sexual practices, including the correct and consistent use of condoms to prevent HIV, other sexually transmitted infections and unwanted pregnancies.WHO does not recommend routine semen testing to detect Zika virus.WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction to Viet Nam based on the current information available.",

        "Description of the Situation": "On 22 March 2016, the National IHR Focal Point of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) notified WHO of cases of yellow fever (YF) in connection with the outbreak currently occurring in Angola. From early January to 22 March 2016, a total of 151 suspected cases of YF, including 21 deaths (CFR: 14%), were reported by the national surveillance system. Of the 151 suspected cases, 9 were confirmed by serology (IgM) at the Institute National Biomedical Research (INRB) in Kinshasa. Given possible cross-reactions with other arboviruses, IgM positive samples were sent to the Pasteur Institute of Dakar for confirmation where 4 tested positive for the infection. Of the 4 cases confirmed in Dakar, 3 were imported from Angola and were detected in the areas of Nsona-Pangu, Kimpese and Kitona in Kongo Central province (formerly, Bas-Congo), DRC. This province shares borders with Angola.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "The Ministry of Health of DRC has activated the National Committee for outbreak management to respond to this event. Undertaken activities include the establishment of coordination mechanisms, social mobilization and community engagement, strengthening surveillance through the training of health workers, dissemination of case definitions, screening and sanitary controls at Points of Entry and screening of refugees\u2019 vaccination status. Other activities are targeting the vaccination of all individual travelling to Angola, strengthening vector control and case management.With support from WHO and partners, the country has developed a contingency plan to improve the country's preparedness for a possible response to cases imported from Angola. A field visit of a national multidisciplinary team in Kongo central is planned in order to organize in-depth investigations of cases and enhance the preparation of the reactive immunization strategy.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "DRC is located in a geographical area known to be YF endemic and autochthonous cases are regularly reported. Since January 2016, autochthonous suspected cases have been recorded in the provinces of Bas-Uele, Equateur, Kasai central, and Tshuapa.The report of yellow fever infection in travellers returning from Angola, however, highlights the risk of international spread of the disease. At this stage, the available information does not suggest the establishment of a cycle of transmission in DRC. Nevertheless, the presence of the competent vector (the Aedes aegypti mosquito), the high proportion of individuals susceptible to the infection, and the intensity of population movements from and to Angola pose a serious risk of further spread of the disease in DRC.WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessment based on the latest available information.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO urges Members States especially those where the establishment of a local cycle of transmission is possible (i.e. where the competent vector is present) to strengthen the control of immunisation status of travellers to all potentially endemic areas.WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction to DRC based on the current information available.",

She spent her first week in Monrovia. She then stayed for a week in Yekeba. During her third week in Liberia, the patient was in Voinjama where she was exposed to rodents. The patient spent the remaining weeks in Foya Kamara. She returned to Sweden on 2 March. Around 8 March, the patient developed symptoms (fever, chills, joint pain, headache and diarrhoea) and, on 17 March, was admitted to hospital. Medical investigations showed signs of encephalitis. On 1 April, Lassa fever was laboratory confirmed at the Public Health Agency of Sweden by serology, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. The patient gradually recovered during her hospitalization but her hearing deteriorated. To prevent secondary transmission, she was transported to a specialized treatment centre and placed in an isolation unit.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "Contact tracing among health care workers and family members has been completed. A total of 74 contacts are currently under observation. The follow-up period (21 days) for the last identified contact will be over on 22 April.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Cases of Lassa fever have already been imported from West Africa to Europe. Data from recent imported cases in Western countries show that secondary transmission of Lassa is rare when standard infection control precautions are observed but might occur. Therefore, the risk for further transmission of Lassa fever in Sweden cannot be excluded but it is currently considered to be low. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessments based on the latest available information.",
        "WHO Advice": "Considering the seasonal flare ups of cases during this time of the year, countries in West Africa that are endemic for Lassa fever are encouraged to strengthen their related surveillance systems.Health-care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed Lassa fever should apply extra infection control measures to prevent contact with the patient\u2019s blood and body fluids and contaminated surfaces or materials such as clothing and bedding. When in close contact (within 1 metre) of patients with Lassa fever, health-care workers should wear face protection (a face shield or a medical mask and goggles), a clean, non-sterile long-sleeved gown, and gloves (sterile gloves for some procedures).Laboratory workers are also at risk. Samples taken from humans and animals for investigation of Lassa virus infection should be handled by trained staff and processed in suitably equipped laboratories under maximum biological containment conditions.The diagnosis of Lassa fever should be considered in febrile patients returning from areas where Lassa fever is endemic. Health-care workers seeing a patient suspected to have Lassa fever should immediately contact local and national experts for advice and to arrange for laboratory testing.WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction to Sweden nor Liberia based on the current information available.",

        "Description of the Situation": "On 18 March 2016, the Department of Health, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region notified WHO of a confirmed case of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus.The patient is an 81-year-old woman with underlying illnesses, travelled to Kaiping, Guangdong Province on 5 March. She developed malaise, headache, shortness of breath and fever on 10 March and, between 14 and 16 March, was admitted to a hospital in Kaiping. Upon return to Hong Kong, on 17 March, the patient visited a hospital and was subsequently admitted for management of pneumonia. She tested positive for avian influenza A(H7N9) virus upon laboratory testing by the Public Health Laboratory Services Branch of the Centre for Health Protection (CHP). The patient was transferred to a different hospital for further management. Currently, she is in stable condition.Initial investigations by the CHP revealed that the patient visited a wet market in Kaiping during her stay in Mainland China. While there, she was exposed to slaughtered poultry.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "The Centre for Health Protection of the Department of Health is tracing and monitoring close contacts of the case.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Most human cases are exposed to the A(H7N9) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, including live poultry markets. Since the virus continues to be detected in animals and environments, further human cases can be expected. Although small clusters of human cases with influenza A(H7N9) viruses have been reported previously including those involving healthcare workers, current epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans. Therefore further community level spread is considered unlikely.Human infections with the A(H7N9) virus are unusual and need to be monitored closely in order to identify changes in the virus and/or its transmission behaviour to humans as it may have a serious public health impact. WHO continues to assess the epidemiological situation and conduct further risk assessment based on the latest information.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid poultry farms, contact with animals in live bird markets, entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travellers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, in order to ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005), and continue national health preparedness actions.",

        "Description of the Situation": "Between 10 and 16 March 2016, the National IHR Focal Point for Germany notified WHO/EURO of 2 cases of Lassa fever.Details of the casesThe first case was a medical health care worker evacuated to Cologne, Germany from Togo on 25 February for treatment of complicated falciparum malaria. The patient passed away on 26 February following multi-organ failure. Autopsy findings were suggestive of haemorrhagic fever, and Lassa fever diagnosis was confirmed on 9 March at the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg, Germany.The secondary case is a funeral home employee who handled the primary case\u2019s corpse on 2 March. The patient is reported to have worn gloves and does not recall being exposed to bodily fluids. Following the primary case\u2019s diagnosis, he had been under home quarantine since 9 March. He already had had symptoms of an upper respiratory infection when he had contact with the corpse. Symptoms waxed and waned over the following days. The first laboratory test for Lassa fever on 10 March was negative by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). When symptoms persisted, diagnostics were repeated and Lassa fever infection was confirmed by PCR on 15 March. The patient has been transported to a special isolation unit in Frankfurt. He has no history of travel in the 21 days prior to the illness. Four of his family members have voluntarily agreed to be quarantined in the same isolation unit. Further investigations are ongoing.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "Following laboratory confirmation of Lassa fever in the index case, 52 contacts have been identified and are currently under follow up. All contacts are either health care personnel or funeral home employees. For 38 of these contacts, the maximum incubation period (21 days) expired on 19 March. All contacts of the secondary case are also being followed up.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Cases of Lassa fever have already been imported from West Africa to Europe. However, it is the first time that secondary transmission of the infection is reported in Europe. Risk for further transmission of Lassa fever in Germany is considered to be low and limited to hospital settings caring for the cases, with all contacts accounted for and monitored. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessments based on the latest available information.",
        "WHO Advice": "The secondary case identified in Germany underlines the need for all countries to ensure the application of standard infection prevention and control precautions when caring for patients, regardless of their presumed diagnosis. These include basic hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, use of personal protective equipment (to block splashes or other contact with infected materials), safe injection practices and safe burial practices.WHO does not recommend any restriction of travel and trade to Germany based on the information available.",

The patient developed diarrhoea, vomiting and fever on 12 February and was treated for malaria. On 26 February, he was medically evacuated with a diagnosis of malaria to Cologne, Germany, where he died of multi-organ failure within hours of arrival. He had no history of travel in the 21 days prior to the onset of symptoms. On 9 March, postmortem diagnosis of Lassa Fever was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing at the Bernhard Nocht Institute (BNI) in Hamburg, Germany.The second case is a 33-year-old, non-national, male health care professional who provided care to the above confirmed case. On 5 March, he developed signs and symptoms similar to those of case 1. On 9 March, the patient was isolated in the same hospital. He was later medically evacuated to the United States of America, arriving in Atlanta on 12 March 2016. The patient has no history of travel in the 21 days prior to the onset of symptoms. He tested positive for Lassa fever by PCR on 12 March at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The patient has been under treatment since his arrival on U.S. soil.

Conducted activities include the review of cases under management at the affected health facility in Togo. Community mobilization and disease awareness campaigns at various levels are also ongoing. Contact tracing and follow-up are being performed. As of 18 March 2016, contacts were being monitored in Togo (n=13), Germany (n=52) and U.S. (n=1). The WHO and CDC web pages for Lassa fever have been updated and the CDC website has been translated in French.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "The affected area in Togo borders with Benin, which has been experiencing a Lassa fever outbreak since December 2015. Furthermore, intense cross-border movement of local populations is reported between the two countries. It is, therefore, not possible to exclude a spread of the outbreak from Benin to Togo.Preliminary sequencing information indicate that the virus incriminated in Togo is a new basal lineage not related to Nigeria, a Lassa fever affected country, which would be consistent with an autochthonous infection. Further sequencing and epidemiological investigation are ongoing to confirm these findings. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessments based on the latest available information.WHO does not recommend any restriction of travel and trade to Togo based on the information available.CORRIGENDUMUpdated on 24 March 2016.

One of these reported cases is linked to the MERS-CoV outbreak currently occurring in a hospital in Buraidah city.Details of the casesA 54-year-old, non-national male from Buraidah city developed symptoms on 4 March and, on 9 March, was admitted to the hospital where the MERS-CoV outbreak is currently occurring. Prior to symptom onset, the patient regularly visited the same health care facility for an unrelated medical condition. On 14 March, the patient, who has comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV. Currently, he is in critical condition in ICU. Investigation of epidemiological link with MERS-CoV cases admitted to the same hospital or with shared healthcare workers is ongoing. The case has no history of exposure to the other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. An 84-year-old male from Buraidah city developed symptoms on 2 March and, on 9 March, was admitted to hospital. The patient, who had comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on 11 March. He passed away on 14 March. Investigation of history of exposure to the known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms is ongoing.A 45-year-old male from Riyadh city developed symptoms on 29 February and, on 13 February, was admitted to hospital. The patient, who has comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on 14 March. Currently, the patient is in stable condition in a negative pressure isolation room on a ward. Investigation of history of exposure to the known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms is ongoing. A 78-year-old female from Alkharj city developed symptoms on 10 March and, on 13 March, was admitted to hospital. The patient, who has comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on 14 March. Currently, she is in stable condition in a negative pressure isolation room on a ward. The patient has a history of frequent consumption of raw camel milk. Contact tracing of household and healthcare contacts is ongoing for these cases.The National IHR Focal Point for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia also notified WHO of the death of 3 MERS-CoV cases that were reported in previous DONs on 21 March (case no. 3 and 4) and on 18 March (case no. 2).Globally, since September 2012, WHO has been notified of 1,698 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 609 related deaths.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "MERS-CoV causes severe human infections resulting in high mortality and has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings.The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to animals or animal products (for example, following contact with dromedaries) or human source (for example, in a health care setting). WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.",
        "WHO Advice": "Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS\u2010CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.Given the lack of evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission in the community, WHO does not recommend travel or trade restrictions with regard to this event. Raising awareness about MERS-CoV among travellers to and from affected countries is good public health practice.",

        "Description of the Situation": "On 21 March, the Ministry of Health of Angola provided WHO with an update on the ongoing outbreak of yellow fever (YF), which started on 5 December 2015 in the Viana municipality, Luanda province.As of 21 March, 16 of the country\u2019s 18 provinces have reported YF suspected cases \u2013 13 of these provinces have reported imported cases linked to Luanda. Local transmission of the disease was documented in 2 of the 11 municipalities of Huambo province. Other provinces have reported autochthonous suspected cases with no epidemiological links to Luanda. These cases are being investigated and outcomes of these investigations will be known in the following days. To date, at least 1,132 suspected and confirmed cases have been reported nationally, including 168 deaths. A total of 375 cases have been laboratory-confirmed. Luanda, the outbreak epicentre, remains the main affected province with 818 cases (281 confirmed confirmed), including 129 deaths. However, the number of cases reported in provinces other than Luanda is apparently increasing.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "A national task force was activated and is now leading the response to the outbreak. WHO is providing support for the coordination of the response operations. On 12 February, WHO declared this outbreak a \u201cgrade 2 emergency\u201d, in accordance with the Emergency Response Framework (ERF). Since then, 65 WHO multidisciplinary experts have been deployed to provide high-level technical support to the country.The Immunization campaign in Luanda, which started on 2 February in Viana, is still ongoing and has so far been implemented in 6 municipalities out of the targeted 12. Three municipalities are reporting high coverage rates (\u226590%) while other municipalities are reporting even higher rates (136% in Viana and 113% in Bela) probably due to people coming from other districts of Luanda as well as other provinces.Surveillance and investigations of newly affected areas are ongoing as well as social mobilization activities. So far, vector control activities are mainly oriented to the control of the mosquito breeding sites.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "The evolution of the situation in Angola is concerning and needs to be closely monitored in the whole African region. Partly, the reported drastic increase in the number of confirmed cases could be attributed to backlog testing. However, the dates of symptom onset of the recently-confirmed cases indicate that transmission is still active in Luanda \u2013 mainly in unimmunized districts and probably in other provinces. Surveillance is reportedly not optimal, especially in the border areas, and a higher number of suspected cases cannot be excluded.Of particular concern is the cross border and international spread risk of the disease, which has already been documented, with cases recently rumoured to have been exported to China, Kenya and the Democratic Republic of Congo. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessments based on the latest available information. It is important to know that imported cases do not represent an outbreak. Although the threat of an outbreak exists, this is considered to be low when the risk factors (susceptible vectors and susceptible human populations) are not present.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO urges Members States, especially those where the establishment of a local cycle of transmission is possible (i.e. where the competent vector, the Aedes aegypti mosquito, is present), to strengthen the control of immunisation status of travellers to all potentially endemic epidemic areas.In the context of an active Yellow fever outbreak in Angola, special attention should also be placed on travellers returning from Angola and other potential epidemic areas. Travellers, particularly those arriving to Asia from Africa or Latin America must have a certificate of yellow fever vaccination. If there are medical grounds for not getting vaccinated, International Health Regulations state that this must be certified by the appropriate authorities.WHO does not recommend any restriction of travel and trade to Angola on the basis of the information available on this outbreak. The vaccination of each person before going to the affected areas as well as measures to avoid mosquito bites are sufficient for the prevention of the disease.",

WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information. \nWHO advice\n\nBased on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.\n\nInfection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.\n\nUntil more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS\u2010CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.\n\nFood hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.\n\nGiven the lack of evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission in the community, WHO does not recommend travel or trade restrictions with regard to this event. Raising awareness about MERS-CoV among travellers to and from affected countries is good public health practice.",

        "Public Health Response": "",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "MERS-CoV causes severe human infections resulting in high mortality and has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings.The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to animals or animal products (for example, following contact with dromedaries) or human source (for example, in a health care setting). WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.",
        "WHO Advice": "Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS\u2010CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.Given the lack of evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission in the community, WHO does not recommend travel or trade restrictions with regard to this event. Raising awareness about MERS-CoV among travellers to and from affected countries is good public health practice.",

        "Description of the Situation": "On 7 March 2016, the National IHR Focal Point of Argentina notified PAHO/WHO of the first chikungunya outbreak in the country.Between 1 January and 31 December 2015, through the surveillance for acute unspecified febrile syndromes, 1,281 suspected cases were investigated for the chikungunya virus. Of these suspected cases, 21 were laboratory-confirmed as being positive for the infection and an additional 22 were classified as probable. From 1 January 2016 to Epidemiological week 8 (21-27 February), 1,030 suspected cases were investigated across the country for chikungunya. Of these suspected cases, 55 tested positive for the infection (30 were classified as autochthonous cases and 25 as imported). An additional 4 probable cases were also reported. The majority of the laboratory-confirmed autochthonous cases (29) were from the province of Salta, specifically from the cities of Tartagal (27) and Apolinario Saravia (2). The remaining confirmed autochthonous case was reported from the city of San Pedro in the province of Jujuy.All confirmed cases tested positive for the chikungunya virus by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "Health authorities in Argentina are taking the following measures:enhancing epidemiological surveillance, including syndromic surveillance and surveillance of severe cases as well as disseminating diagnostic and notification algorithms for dengue, chikungunya and Zika;conducting vector control activities in the affected areas;communicating with health professionals and the public.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "This is the first time that autochthonous transmission of chikungunya is reported in Argentina. The affected area is situated next to the border with Bolivia where the virus has been known to circulate for a number of years. In Argentina, there is the potential of geographical extension to other areas where the vector Aedes is present. Furthermore, there is also possibility of extension to other countries in the region of the Americas where the competent vectors are also present. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessment based on the latest available information.",
        "WHO Advice": "The proximity of mosquito vector breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for chikungunya virus infection. Prevention and control relies on reducing the breeding of mosquitoes through source reduction (removal and modification of breeding sites) and reducing contact between mosquitoes and people. This can be achieved by reducing the number of natural and artificial water-filled habitats that support mosquito larvae, reducing the adult mosquito populations around at-risk communities and by using barriers such as insect screens, closed doors and windows, long clothing and repellents. Since the Aedes mosquitoes (the primary vector for transmission) are day-biting mosquitoes, it is recommended that those who sleep during the daytime, particularly young children, the sick or elderly, should rest under mosquito nets (bed nets), treated with or without insecticide to provide protection.During outbreaks, space spraying of insecticides may be carried out following the technical orientation provided by WHO to kill flying mosquitoes. Suitable insecticides (recommended by the WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme) may also be used as larvicides to treat relatively large water containers, when this is technically indicated. Source reduction with active community support should be encouraged.Basic precautions for protection from mosquito bites should be taken by people traveling to high risk areas. These include use of repellents, wearing light colored, long sleeved shirts and pants and ensuring rooms are fitted with screens to prevent mosquitoes from entering.WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction to Argentina based on the current information available.",

The patient is a woman from the province of Cordoba who developed symptoms on 16 February* and was confirmed positive for Zika virus infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at the Provincial Central Laboratory. She is related to an imported case who presented with symptoms compatible with Zika virus infection and who had recent travelled to Colombia, a Zika virus-affected country.The mode of transmission of the virus is under investigation; however, it is likely that the infection was sexually transmitted. Samples from both patients have been sent to the National Reference Laboratory for further testing and confirmation.Currently, the province of Cordoba is registering a dengue epidemic. Local health authorities are conducting vector control activities as well as carrying out active case finding.FranceOn 1 March 2016, the National IHR Focal Point for France notified WHO of a probable case of sexual transmission of Zika virus.On 24 February, the local health authorities of Ile-de-France region reported the first case (Person A) of sexually transmitted Zika virus disease in the country. This case developed symptoms consistent with Zika virus disease (fever, rash, arthralgia, myalgia), after having sex with her partner (Person B) who had travelled to Brazil and returned to France on 10 February.

Person A had no previous history of travel.Infection by Zika virus was confirmed for both cases by the national reference centre for arboviruses on 24 February \u2013 positive PCR in saliva and urine for Person A, and positive PCR on urine sample for the Person B. Additional serological evaluation is currently ongoing. Pregnancy was ruled out by a biological test.",
        "Epidemiology": "",

At the beginning of February, a case of Zika virus infection acquired through sexual transmission was reported in the United States of America (see DON published on 12 February). These cases of sexual transmission do not change the overall risk assessment since the virus continues to be primarily transmitted to people through mosquito bites. The risk of a global spread of Zika virus to areas where the competent vectors, the Aedes mosquitoes, are present is significant, given the wide geographical distribution of these mosquitoes in various regions of the world. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessment based on the latest available information.",
        "WHO Advice": "Although the risk of transmission of Zika virus through sexual activity is considered to be very limited, based on precautionary principles, WHO recommends the following:All patients (male and female) with Zika virus infection and their sexual partners (particularly pregnant women) should receive information about the potential risks of sexual transmission of Zika virus, contraceptive measures and safer sexual practices, and should be provided with condoms when feasible. Women who have had unprotected sex and do not wish to become pregnant because of concern with infection with Zika virus should also have ready access to emergency contraceptive services and counselling.Sexual partners of pregnant women, living in or returning from areas where local transmission of Zika virus is known to occur, should use safer sexual practices or abstinence from sexual activity for the duration of the pregnancy.As most Zika virus infections are asymptomatic:Men and women living in areas where local transmission of Zika virus is known to occur should consider adopting safer sexual practices or abstaining from sexual activity.Men and women returning from areas where local transmission of Zika virus is known to occur should adopt safer sexual practices or consider abstinence for at least four weeks after return.Independently of considerations regarding Zika virus, WHO always recommends the use of safer sexual practices, including the correct and consistent use of condoms to prevent HIV, other sexually transmitted infections and unwanted pregnancies.WHO does not recommend routine semen testing to detect Zika virus.The proximity of mosquito vector breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for Zika virus infection. Prevention and control relies on reducing the breeding of mosquitoes through source reduction (removal and modification of breeding sites) and reducing contact between mosquitoes and people.

On February 8, he developed symptoms and, on 11 February, consulted a private doctor. The patient was then admitted to hospital. His nasopharyngeal aspirate collected on 12 February initially tested negative for influenza A virus. On 15 February, the patient was discharged. On 23 February, re-testing of the sample taken on 12 February tested positive for influenza A (H7N9). He was re-admitted to hospital for isolation and is currently in stable condition. Preliminary epidemiological investigations revealed that the patient worked in Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China. He returned to Hong Kong SAR, China on 5 February. During his stay in Suzhou, the patient visited a wet market but denied having any direct contact with poultry during the incubation period.

        "Description of the Situation": "On 25 January 2016, the National IHR Focal Point of Benin notified WHO of an outbreak of Lassa fever.The outbreak was initially detected on 21 January following reports of unexplained fever within a cluster of health workers from the district of Tchaourou, Borgou department. On 3 January, these health workers provided care to a patient suffering from haemorrhagic fever. Between 21 January and 16 February, 71 cases (6 confirmed, 10 probable et 55 suspected) were reported from seven departments \u2013 namely, Borgou (52), Collines (13), Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 (2), Alibori (1), Atlantique (1), Kouffo (1) and Littoral (1). During the same period of time, a total of 23 deaths were recorded in the departments of Borgou (16), Collines (4), Atlantique (1), Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 (1) and Plateau. Seven of the reported cases (3 confirmed, 1 probable and 3 suspected), including 2 deaths (1 confirmed and 1 probable), were health workers. To date, 6 cases, including 2 deaths, have been laboratory confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction at the Virology Unit, Central Research Laboratory, Lagos University Teaching Hospital in Lagos, Nigeria.",
        "Epidemiology": "Lassa fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic fever illness with an incubation period of 1-4 weeks and is endemic in West Africa. The Lassa virus is transmitted to humans via contact with food or household items contaminated with rodent urine or faeces. Person-to-person infections and laboratory transmission can also occur, particularly in hospitals lacking adequate infection prevent and control measures. The disease is endemic in the rodent population in parts of West Africa. Lassa fever is known to be endemic in Benin (where it was diagnosed for the first time in November 2014), Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Sierra Leone and parts of Nigeria, but probably exists in other West African countries as well. The overall case-fatality rate is 1%. Observed case-fatality rate among patients hospitalized with severe cases of Lassa fever is 15%. Early supportive care with rehydration and symptomatic treatment improves survival.",
        "Public Health Response": "The Ministry of Health of Benin, with the support of WHO and partners, is coordinating the management of the outbreak. Control measures are being implemented, including field investigation, enhanced surveillance, case management, infection prevention and control, contact tracing and follow-up, and social mobilization.WHO has deployed a multidisciplinary team in the affected areas to support the response. WHO's Regional Office for Africa (WHO/AFRO) has deployed two experts and has provided financial support to the country.Since the beginning of the outbreak, a total of 318 contacts have been identified and 292 are currently under follow-up.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Lassa fever is endemic in neighbouring Nigeria and other West African countries. The disease causes outbreaks almost every year in different parts of Benin, with yearly peaks observed between December and February. Although, this is only the second Lassa outbreak reported in Benin, the outbreak is occurring during known seasonal patterns. According to available information, its characteristics are similar to other outbreaks described elsewhere; however, considering seasonal case flare-ups during this time of the year, countries in West Africa endemic for Lassa fever are encouraged to strengthen the related surveillance systems.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO does not recommend any restriction of travel and trade to Benin based on the information available.",

        "Description of the Situation": "On 21 January 2016, the National IHR Focal Point of Angola notified WHO of an outbreak of yellow fever.The first cases were identified in the district of Viana (Luanda province) on 5 December 2015. Yellow fever infection was initially confirmed in three patients by polymerase chain reaction at the Zoonosis and Emerging Disease Laboratory of the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in Johannesburg, South Africa and at the Pasteur Institute in Dakar, Senegal. As of 8 February, a total of 164 suspected cases and 37 deaths had been reported in Angola. The majority of cases (n=138) had been reported in the province of Luanda. Other affected provinces include Cabinda, Cuanza Sul, Huambo, Huila and Uige. Suspected cases are undergoing laboratory testing in order to rule out other aetiologies and cross reactions with yellow fever.",
        "Epidemiology": "Yellow fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes. Up to 50% of severely affected persons without treatment will die from yellow fever. There are an estimated 130,000 cases of yellow fever reported yearly, causing 44,000 deaths worldwide each year, with 90% occurring in Africa. There is no specific treatment for yellow fever. Treatment is symptomatic, aimed at reducing the symptoms for the comfort of the patient. Vaccination is the most important preventive measure against yellow fever. Since the second half of 2015, yellow fever virus circulation has been reported in Mali and Ghana.",
        "Public Health Response": "The national task force has been activated to control the outbreak. Health authorities in Angola are implementing a number of control and response activities, including coordination, clinical case management, enhanced surveillance, laboratory testing, social mobilization and vector control. Epidemiological and entomological investigations are ongoing in the main affected areas.WHO has deployed three experts to provide operational support. In addition to financial support, technical directives and guidelines have been shared with country officials to improve the quality of the response.On 2 February, an immunization campaign was launched in Luanda. The campaign will initially cover a target population of 1,578,085 in Viana.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "In the affected districts of Luanda, there is a high density of Aedes Aegypti, the primary vector of yellow fever; consequently, the risk of spread to unaffected districts is high. This risk is further exacerbated by the high proportion of susceptible individuals, as the only protected groups are the citizens with international vaccination cards and those children that have been vaccinated against yellow fever since 2008. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessment. WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction to Angola based on the current information available.",

Although evidence concerning a potential association between Zika virus and congenital neurological disorders among newborns is mounting, the available information is not yet sufficient to establish such a causative link. Further investigations are, therefore, required. Until more is understood, Members States are advised to standardize and enhance surveillance for microcephaly and other neurological disorders, particularly in areas of known Zika virus transmission and areas at risk of such transmission. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessment based on the latest available information.",
        "WHO Advice": "The proximity of mosquito vector breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for Zika virus infection. Prevention and control relies on reducing the breeding of mosquitoes through source reduction (removal and modification of breeding sites) and reducing contact between mosquitoes and people. This can be achieved by reducing the number of natural and artificial water-filled habitats that support mosquito larvae, reducing the adult mosquito populations around at-risk communities and by using barriers such as insect screens, closed doors and windows, long clothing and repellents. Since the Aedes mosquitoes (the primary vector for transmission) are day-biting mosquitoes, it is recommended that those who sleep during the daytime, particularly young children, the sick or elderly, should rest under mosquito nets (bed nets), treated with or without insecticide to provide protection.During outbreaks, space spraying of insecticides may be carried out following the technical orientation provided by WHO to kill flying mosquitoes. Suitable insecticides (recommended by the WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme) may also be used as larvicides to treat relatively large water containers, when this is technically indicated.Basic precautions for protection from mosquito bites should be taken by people traveling to high risk areas, especially pregnant women. These include use of repellents, wearing light colored, long sleeved shirts and pants and ensuring rooms are fitted with screens to prevent mosquitoes from entering.WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction to Zika-affected countries based on the current information available.",

Several days after returning to the United States, Person A developed symptoms consistent with Zika virus infection, including fever, rash, conjunctivitis, and malaise. One day prior to symptom onset and once during the symptomatic period, Person A had sex with Person B (non-traveller). Approximately one week after the onset of illness in Person A, Person B developed symptoms consistent with Zika virus disease, including fever, pruritic rash, conjunctivitis, small joint arthralgia and malaise.Laboratory tests confirmed Zika virus infection in both Person A and Person B. Samples collected from Person A at 14 days after symptom onset and from Person B at 4 and 7 days after illness onset had evidence of Zika virus IgM and neutralizing antibodies. Additional tests are being carried out.

        "WHO Risk Assessment": "This is not the first Zika virus case acquired through sexual transmission. Sporadic cases of infection acquired via this route have already been reported in the literature. The risk of disease spread through sexual activity is very limited. This potential case of sexual transmission does not change the overall risk assessment since the virus is primarily transmitted to people through mosquito bites. The risk of a global spread of Zika virus to areas where the competent vectors, the Aedes mosquitoes, are present is significant, given the wide geographical distribution of these mosquitoes in various regions of the world.

Cases ranged in age from 14 to 91 years, with a median age of 58 years. Of these 28 cases, 18 (64%) were male. The majority (25 cases, 89%) reported exposure to live poultry or live poultry markets; the exposure history of three cases is unknown or no clear exposure to poultry. No clusters were reported. Cases were reported from six provinces and municipalities: Zhejiang (13), Jiangsu (5), Guangdong (4), Fujian (3), Shanghai (2) and Hunan (1). See attachment for individual case information.Detailed information concerning these cases can be found in a separate document (see related links).",

        "WHO Risk Assessment": "WHO is assessing the epidemiological situation and conducting further risk assessment based on the latest information. Based on the information received thus far, the overall public health risk from avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses has not changed.If the pattern of human cases follows the trends seen in previous years, the number of human cases may rise over the coming months. Further sporadic cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus are expected in affected and possibly in the neighboring areas. Should human cases from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during travels or after arrival. If this were to occur, community level spread is considered unlikely as the virus has not demonstrated the ability to transmit easily among humans.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid poultry farms, contact with animals in live bird markets, entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals.

        "WHO Risk Assessment": "",
        "WHO Advice": "The proximity of mosquito vector breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for Zika virus infection. Prevention and control relies on reducing the breeding of mosquitoes through source reduction (removal and modification of breeding sites) and reducing contact between mosquitoes and people. This can be achieved by reducing the number of natural and artificial water-filled habitats that support mosquito larvae, reducing the adult mosquito populations around at-risk communities and by using barriers such as insect screens, closed doors and windows, long clothing and repellents. Since the Aedes mosquitoes (the primary vector for transmission) are day-biting mosquitoes, it is recommended that those who sleep during the daytime, particularly young children, the sick or elderly, should rest under mosquito nets (bed nets), treated with or without insecticide to provide protection.During outbreaks, space spraying of insecticides may be carried out following the technical orientation provided by WHO to kill flying mosquitoes. Suitable insecticides (recommended by the WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme) may also be used as larvicides to treat relatively large water containers, when this is technically indicated.Basic precautions for protection from mosquito bites should be taken by people traveling to high risk areas, especially pregnant women. These include use of repellents, wearing light colored, long sleeved shirts and pants and ensuring rooms are fitted with screens to prevent mosquitoes from entering.WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction to the United States of America based on the current information available.",

Details of the outbreaksBetween August 2015 and 23 January 2016, 159 suspected cases of Lassa fever, including 82 deaths, were reported across 19 states. Investigations are ongoing and a retrospective review of cases is currently being performed; therefore, these figures are subject to change. The 4 most affected states are Bauchi, Edo, Oyo and Taraba, which account for 54% of the confirmed cases (n=54) and 52% of the reported deaths (n=34). The remaining 15 States have reported less than 5 confirmed cases. Samples of 54 cases, including 34 deaths, were confirmed for Lassa fever by reverse transcription polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR). All samples tested negative for Ebola virus disease, Dengue and yellow fever. To date, 4 health care workers were laboratory-confirmed for Lassa fever; of these 4 cases, 2 passed away. It is important to note that these cases are not considered as cases of hospital-acquired infection as no confirmed or suspected cases were reported in the 4 different health facilities where these health care workers were employed.As of 21 January, 2,504 contacts had been listed and 1,942 are currently being monitored. A total of 562 contacts have completed follow up. So far, none of the contacts have tested positive for Lassa fever.",
        "Epidemiology": "Lassa fever is endemic in Nigeria and causes outbreaks almost every year in different parts of the country, with yearly peaks observed between December and February. The disease is an acute viral haemorrhagic illness caused by Lassa virus, a member of the arenavirus family of viruses. It is transmitted to humans from contacts with food or household items contaminated with rodent excreta. The disease is endemic in the rodent population in parts of West Africa. Person-to-person infections and laboratory transmission can also occur, particularly in the hospital environment in the absence of adequate infection control measures. Diagnosis and prompt treatment are essential.",

Of the 5 confirmed cases, 4 are from the Delmas commune while the remaining case is from the P\u00e9tion-Ville commune. Samples of the patient were sent to the Caribbean Public Health Agency (CARPHA) laboratory in Trinidad and Tobago for testing. All cases were confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR).In addition, between 4 and 12 January 2016, the National IHR Focal Point for Germany notified PAHO/WHO of 2 cases of Zika virus infection in German nationals who had returned from Haiti to Germany in late December. Samples from both patients were collected and sent for laboratory testing to the national reference centre for tropical diseases in Germany.

        "WHO Advice": "The proximity of mosquito vector breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for Zika virus infection. Prevention and control relies on reducing the breeding of mosquitoes through source reduction (removal and modification of breeding sites) and reducing contact between mosquitoes and people. This can be achieved by reducing the number of natural and artificial water-filled habitats that support mosquito larvae, reducing the adult mosquito populations around at-risk communities and by using barriers such as insect screens, closed doors and windows, long clothing and repellents. Since the Aedes mosquitoes (the primary vector for transmission) are day-biting mosquitoes, it is recommended that those who sleep during the daytime, particularly young children, the sick or elderly, should rest under mosquito nets (bed nets), treated with or without insecticide to provide protection.During outbreaks, space spraying of insecticides may be carried out following the technical orientation provided by WHO to kill flying mosquitoes. Suitable insecticides (recommended by the WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme) may also be used as larvicides to treat relatively large water containers, when this is technically indicated.Basic precautions for protection from mosquito bites should be taken by people traveling to high risk areas, especially pregnant women. These include use of repellents, wearing light colored, long sleeved shirts and pants and ensuring rooms are fitted with screens to prevent mosquitoes from entering.WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction to Haiti based on the current information available.",

        "WHO Advice": "Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS\u2010CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.WHO remains vigilant and is monitoring the situation. Given the lack of evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission in the community, WHO does not recommend travel or trade restrictions with regard to this event. Raising awareness about MERS-CoV among travellers to and from affected countries is good public health practice.",

        "WHO Advice": "Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS\u2010CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.WHO remains vigilant and is monitoring the situation. Given the lack of evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission in the community, WHO does not recommend travel or trade restrictions with regard to this event. Raising awareness about MERS-CoV among travellers to and from affected countries is good public health practice.",

        "Description of the Situation": "Between 30 December 2015 and 2 January 2016, the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) of China notified WHO of 2 additional laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N6) virus.Details of the casesThe first case is a 26-year-old female from Baoan District, Shenzhen City, with onset date of 24 December. The patient was admitted to hospital on 27 December and is now in critical condition.The second case is a 40-year-old female from Duanzhou District, Zhaoqing City, with onset date of 22 December. The patient was admitted to hospital on 28 December and is now in critical condition.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "The Chinese Government has taken the following surveillance and control measures:making every effort to treat the patient; collecting and testing the specimens of the patient, carrying out viral isolation and whole genome sequencing and comparison;conducting epidemiological investigation; tracing, managing and observing the close contacts of the patient;strengthening surveillance of unexplained pneumonia and routine sentinel surveillance of influenza; strengthening the etiological surveillance of influenza/avian influenza virus.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "WHO continues to closely monitor the influenza A(H5N6) situation and conduct risk assessments. So far, the overall risk associated with avian influenza A(H5N6) viruses has not changed.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid poultry farms, or contact with animals in live bird markets, or entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travellers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, in order to ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005), and continue national health preparedness actions.",
