In 2021, 23 countries reported cholera outbreaks, mainly in the WHO Regions of Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean. This trend has continued into 2022 with over 29 countries (Figure 1) reporting cholera cases or outbreaks. As of 30 November 2022, 16 of these have been reporting protracted outbreaks. Many of those countries reported higher case numbers and case fatality ratio (CFR) than in previous years. The average cholera CFR reported globally in 2021 was 1.9% (2.9% in Africa), well above acceptable (<1%) and the highest recorded in over a decade. This year the number of cholera cases and cholera-associated deaths have surged globally following years of decline. Of particular concern are the outbreaks in 13 countries, which did not report cholera cases in 2021. Of these, some had not reported any cholera outbreaks for many years (between three and 30), and several are not considered cholera-endemic countries.i,ii\u00a0The current situation represents a resurgence of the ongoing seventh pandemic of cholera which began in 1961. The simultaneous progression of several cholera outbreaks, compounded in countries facing complex humanitarian crises with fragile health systems and aggravated by climate change, poses challenges to outbreak response and risks further spreading to other countries. The overall capacity to respond to the multiple and simultaneous outbreaks is strained due to the global lack of resources, including the oral cholera vaccine, as well as overstretched public health and medical personnel, who are often dealing with multiple disease outbreaks at the same time. \u00a0Figure-1: Incidence of cholera casesiii(including estimated cases of acute watery diarrhoea (AWD)iv) \u00a0per 100,000 population reported to WHO from 1 January to 30 November 2022v Note: countries in white did not report any cholera cases in 2022\u00a0Figure-2: Cholera cases* reported to WHO by year and continent, global CFR, 1989-2021*** In 2017 and 2019, Yemen accounted for 84% and 93% of all cholera cases respectively (Weekly Epidemiological Report 2018, 2020).**The data for 2022 is not included in the epidemic curve due to (i) incompleteness (data available until 30 November 2022), (ii) provisional estimates. Official reporting of case counts per country to WHO is expected at the end of the year.To note: data on cholera are often incomplete and underreporting is common. Several countries do not have reporting systems for cholera. This is why complete lists of countries with outbreaks, nor accurate case and death counts cannot be provided.DRIVERS OF THE CURRENT OUTBREAKS AND CHALLENGES IMPACTING THE RESPONSE The main drivers and challenges for controlling and containing the current cholera outbreaks are outlined below. Yet, addressing the need for,\u00a0 and lack of funding to prevent outbreaks is critical. Large-scale investments in water and sanitation infrastructure have largely led to the elimination of cholera in Europe and the Americas. Significant investments should support water, sanitation, and hygiene\u00a0(WASH) interventions for cholera prevention and control. Such interventions should consider the social context and be supported by the best available evidence and updated models of cholera transmission.1Climate change \u2013 widespread floods and droughtOf the countries that have reported cholera outbreaks in 2022, many are experiencing natural disasters such as cyclones (Mozambique, Malawi), flooding (Pakistan, Nigeria), and drought (countries in the Horn of Africa). Major flooding and above-normal hurricane seasons increase outbreak severity and the propensity for regional spread. The upcoming rainy/cyclone season, which is predicted to be severe, has the potential to spread the disease across Southern Africa. The above-normal hurricane season in the Americas is affecting several countries in the Caribbean and Central America causing major flooding. Post-monsoon season (and post-floods) is usually associated with a cholera peak in South Asia. Additionally, many countries experienced droughts leading to cholera2 due to poor access to water, marginalization of refugees and nomadic populations, and expansion of informal urban settlements. \u00a0Humanitarian crises, political instability, and conflictIncreasing humanitarian crises due to conflict, political instability, and a lack of development are leaving an increasing number of people at risk for cholera across all WHO regions. Of the countries that have reported outbreaks, nine are experiencing conflict or political violence in affected areas (Afghanistan, Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Nigeria, Somalia, the Syrian Arab Republic, and Yemen). In two of these countries (Ethiopia and Cameroon), the current outbreak is not affecting conflict areas, but there is a high risk of spreading into areas of ongoing conflict, which would complicate the response. \u00a0Multiple ongoing emergenciesSeveral countries with cholera outbreaks are also responding to multiple other disease outbreaks including mpox (monkeypox), dengue, chikungunya, measles, and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This also strains the overall response capacity to cholera, particularly in countries with limited resources.Sub-optimal / delayed surveillance. The lack of data hinders response. There are several country- and surveillance-specific reasons for the lack of data: (1) Countries with inadequate surveillance systems overall; (2) Countries with robust surveillance systems, which only report cholera from sentinel sites or do not include cholera at all; (3) Lack of data sharing; (4) Breakdown of surveillance systems during humanitarian crises and political instability; (5) Insufficient capacity for lab confirmation and use of heterogenous case definitions (eg. cholera versus acute watery diarrhea).Medical commodities supply chainAt the time of this report, the global supply of cholera kits is depleted, and suppliers are struggling to meet demand. Delays or shortages of medical supplies can lead to preventable and avoidable deaths. WHO is facilitating global coordination and alternate sources of supply are being sought, but these will not be available immediately. Limited availability of healthcare resourcesThe number of outbreaks and geographic scope has stretched the capacity of healthcare services to implement a comprehensive multisectoral response. Parallel large-scale, high-risk outbreaks and other public health and humanitarian crises are further stretching resources and limiting the capacity to respond. In addition, the emigration of skilled medical personnel during a humanitarian crisis, interruption in routine health services such as vaccination leading to (re)-emergence of vaccine-preventable diseases, destruction or inaccessibility of healthcare infrastructure, and violence against health workers have hindered outbreak response activities.Availability of oral cholera vaccineThe global stockpile of Oral Cholera Vaccine (OCV) is currently insufficient to meet all requests for two doses of preventive vaccination. As a result, on 20 October 2022, the International Coordinating Group (ICG) members (IFRC, MSF, UNICEF, and WHO) took the unprecedented decision to temporarily limit all reactive OCV campaigns to one single dose. The production of OCV is a continuous process with around 2.5 million doses produced monthly. As vaccine manufacturers are producing at their maximum current capacity, there is no short-term solution to increase production. While using a single dose instead of two doses will allow more people to be protected in the short term, this strategy has its limitations, and it is unclear how long immunity will last. To solve the problem in the long term there needs to be an increase in global vaccine production. Since the creation of the global stockpile in 2013, more than 50 million doses of OCV have been successfully used in various settings through mass campaigns.3REGIONAL OVERVIEWIn the table below, some countries under monitoring are described. These include countries with recently reported outbreaks of cholera, countries where we have observed a continuous rise in cases with challenges to control the outbreak, countries with protracted outbreaks with challenges to control, countries with repeated outbreaks in 2022, countries with large vulnerable populations, and countries where insecurity and conflict hinder the response.",
        "Epidemiology": "Cholera is an acute diarrheal infection characterized, in its severe form, by extreme watery diarrhea and potentially fatal dehydration. It is caused by the ingestion of food or water contaminated with the bacterium\u00a0Vibrio cholerae. It has a short incubation period, ranging between two hours and five days. Most people will develop no or only mild symptoms; less than 20% of ill persons develop acute watery diarrhoea with moderate or severe dehydration and are at risk for rapid loss of body fluids, dehydration, and death. Despite being easily treatable with rehydration solution, cholera remains a global threat due to its high morbidity and mortality in vulnerable populations with a lack of access to adequate health care.Seven distinct pandemics of cholera have been recorded during the past two centuries. The seventh pandemic, which is still ongoing today, is considered to have occurred principally between 1961 to 1974. During this period, following (re)introduction, many countries transitioned to becoming cholera-endemic. While global incidence greatly decreased in the late 1990s, cholera remained prevalent in parts of Africa and Asia.The global burden of cholera is largely unknown because the majority of cases are not reported, however, previous studies estimate 2.9 million cases, and 95,000 deaths occur annually.",
        "Public Health Response": "WHO is working with partners at global, regional & country level to support Member States in the following cholera outbreak response activities: CoordinationProviding a forum for technical expertise exchange through the Global Task Force on Cholera Control (GTFCC) coordination, and cooperation on cholera-related activities to strengthen the country\u2019s capacity to prevent and control cholera.Providing technical support to all ongoing outbreaks (laboratory, case management, OCV, WASH).Collaborating with key partners (UNICEF, MSF) to coordinate supply and optimal access to supplies. Leveraging resources to support global monitoring of the cholera pandemic, provide technical support to countries, enhance data collection and reporting, strengthen advocacy, and provide medical and non-medical items to countries in need, especially for case management and diagnosis.Supporting the deployment of experts through GAVI, GOARN, and standby partners.SurveillanceStrengthening surveillance including strengthening diagnostic algorithms, use of rapid diagnostic tests, collecting and transporting of samples, and strengthening laboratory capacity to culture V. cholerae.VaccineProviding guidance to identify target populations for vaccination and requesting vaccine through the ICG mechanism, in the context of acutely limited supply.Supporting advocacy to increase OCV production and engage new vaccine manufacturers.Working with countries to identify the areas/hotspots where vaccination is most needed.6Case managementStrengthening case management and improving access to treatment for patients by setting-up dedicated healthcare facilities (Cholera Treatment Centres (CTCs) and Cholera Treatment Units (CTUs)) and training health workers and provision of technical guidanceInfection Prevention and Control (IPC)Conducting advocacy and resource mobilization activities to support cholera prevention and control at national, regional, and global levels.Risk communication and community engagement (RCCE)Working closely with Member States and partners to\u00a0strengthen risk communication and community engagement plans and strategies, adapted to local beliefs and contexts, to encourage behavioural change and adoption of appropriate protective measures such as vaccination, and ensuring safe food, water, and hygiene practices.Providing support to increasing risk perception and knowledge among communities about the disease, its symptoms, associated risks, precautions to take, and when to seek treatment when symptoms appear.Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH)Working closely with Member States and partners to strengthen water, hygiene, and sanitation systems through multi-sectoral mechanisms, including IPC and guidance on water quality monitoring.Supporting countries for the implementation of effective cholera control strategies and monitoring of progress.Operations, Support, and Logistics (OSL)Working closely with suppliers to secure Cholera Kits, sourcing other WASH supplies, and establishing a pipeline for bulk items.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "On 26 October 2022, WHO assessed the risk of cholera at the global level as very high, remaining a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequity and lack of social development. There has been an increase in global reported cholera outbreaks with 29 countries, mainly in the WHO African and Eastern Mediterranean Regions, reporting outbreaks to WHO in 2022 with many of those reporting higher case numbers and case fatality ratios (CFR) than in previous years. Several countries are in the midst of complex humanitarian crises with fragile health systems, inadequate access to clean water and sanitation, and insufficient capacity to respond to these outbreaks. Climate change and lack of development also contribute to outbreaks, and cross-border population movements. The latter, along with increased global travel following the COVID-19 pandemic, further increase the risk of international spread.The number of outbreaks occurring simultaneously across all WHO Regions is straining the overall epidemic response capacity. Protracted outbreaks of cholera are draining public health response personnel and depleting resources. Due to the global shortage of OCV, the ICG recently made the unprecedented decision to temporarily suspend the second dose strategy for the outbreak response. There are also significant delays and shortages of medical supplies that can lead to preventable and avoidable deaths.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO recommends improving access to proper and timely case management of cholera cases, improving access to safe drinking water and sanitation infrastructure, as well as improving infection prevention and control in healthcare facilities. These measures along with the promotion of preventive hygiene practices and food safety in affected communities are the most effective means of controlling cholera. Effective risk communication and community engagement strategies are needed to encourage behavioral change and adoption of appropriate preventive measures.The OCV should be used in conjunction with improvements in water and sanitation to control cholera outbreaks and for prevention in targeted areas known to be at high risk for cholera. WHO recommends Member States to strengthen and maintain surveillance for cholera, especially at the community level, for the early detection of suspected cases and to provide adequate treatment and prevent its spread. Early and adequate treatment limits the CFR of patients to less than 1%. WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions on Member States based on the currently available information. However, as the outbreak also affects border areas where there is a significant cross-border movement, WHO encourages Member States to ensure cooperation and regular information sharing across all levels of the organization so that any spread across the border is quickly assessed and contained.",

        "Date Reported": "13 December 2022",
        "Location": "Haiti",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "Haiti is experiencing a resurgence of cholera, with the outbreak initially reported on 2 October 2022 after more than three years with no reported cases of cholera, evolving rapidly, and spreading to all parts of the country.\nThere is also an ongoing complex humanitarian crisis that is rapidly deteriorating due to gang violence, socio-political conflicts, insecurity, fuel shortages, and economic instability. This has resulted in limited access to healthcare and essential services, including water, food, sanitation, and supply services. This situation makes the population of Haiti highly vulnerable to the ongoing cholera outbreak.",
        "Description of the Situation": "Between 2 October through 6 December 2022, a cumulative total of 13 672 suspected cholera cases, including 283 deaths (case fatality rate is 2.05%) have been reported by the Haiti Ministry of Public Health and Population from all ten departments in the country. Eighty-six percent (n=11 751) of all reported cases have been hospitalized. The Ouest department accounts for the highest percentage (89%, N=12 112) of suspected cases. Of the 13 672 suspected cholera cases reported, 59% are male and the most affected age groups are children aged 1 to 4 years (19%), followed by 20 to 29 years (15%) and 30 to 39 years (15%).A total of 1193 confirmed cases have been reported. Three departments account for 94% of the reported confirmed cases: Ouest (79%; n= 943 cases), Centre (13%; n= 156 cases), and Artibonite (2%; n= 28 cases). Laboratory confirmation was by rapid diagnostic test and stool culture was done for identification of Vibrio cholerae. Of the confirmed cholera cases with available information, 57% are male (n=680) and the most affected age groups are those aged 1 to 4 years (19%) followed by 30 to 39 years (15%) and 5 to 9 years (14%).As of 4 November 2022, a total of 368 suspected cases, including 14 confirmed cases and 14 deaths have been reported from the Port-au-Prince prison. These cases are included among the cases reported in the department of Ouest. Additionally, as of 21 November 2022, the Ministry of Public Health of the Dominican Republic has reported two confirmed imported cases of cholera, both from Haiti.Cholera was first reported in Haiti in October 2010. Nationally, a total of 820 000 cases of cholera including 9792 deaths were reported between October 2010 and February 2019. The last confirmed case in this outbreak was reported in January 2019 in I\u2019Est\u00e8re in the Artibonite department of Haiti. The country did not report a single case of cholera in the three years from January 2019 to January 2022. The current outbreak is also occurring in the context of a complex humanitarian crisis that is exacerbating the burden of disease and hindering response measures.\u00a0Figure 1: Number of suspected cholera cases (n=13 672) reported in Haiti from 2 October to 6 December 2022.\u00a0Source: Haiti Minist\u00e8re de la Sant\u00e9 Publique et de la Population (MSPP).

        "Epidemiology": "Cholera is an acute enteric infection caused by ingesting the bacteria\u00a0Vibrio cholerae\u00a0present in contaminated water or food. It is mainly linked to inadequate sanitation and insufficient access to safe drinking water. It is an extremely virulent disease that can cause severe acute watery diarrhoea resulting in high morbidity and mortality, and can spread rapidly, depending on the frequency of exposure, the exposed population and the setting. Cholera affects both children and adults and can be fatal within hours if untreated.The incubation period is between 12 hours and five days after ingestion of contaminated food or water. Most people infected with\u00a0V. cholerae\u00a0do not develop any symptoms, although the bacteria are present in their faeces for 1-10 days after infection and are shed back into the environment, potentially infecting other people. The majority of people who develop symptoms have mild or moderate symptoms, while a minority develop acute watery diarrhoea and vomiting with severe dehydration. Cholera is an easily treatable disease. Most people can be treated successfully through prompt administration of oral rehydration solution (ORS).The consequences of a humanitarian crisis \u2013 such as disruption of water and sanitation systems, or the displacement of populations towards inadequate and overcrowded camps \u2013 can increase the risk of cholera transmission, should the bacteria be present or introduced.A multi-sectoral approach including a combination of surveillance, water, sanitation and hygiene (WaSH), social mobilization, treatment, and oral cholera vaccines is essential to control cholera outbreaks and to reduce deaths.",
        "Public Health Response": "Emergency response activities are being conducted by the Haiti Ministry of Public Health (MSPP), WHO and other partners as below.Laboratory and Surveillance: WHO is supporting the Haiti Ministry of Public Health (MSPP) in strengthening epidemiological surveillance and laboratory capacity. Training of nurses and sampling teams have been conducted to perform rapid diagnostic tests in the Centre and Ouest departments. Given the complexity of land transport, WHO also facilitates the transport of samples to the National Reference Laboratory (LNSP) through United Nations Humanitarian Service (UNHAS) flights. A total of 35 samples from the Nord-Ouest departments have been transported to the LNSP.WHO is also supporting the Dominican Republic to strengthen its capacity to detect and respond to outbreaks and/or imported cases of cholera in its territory.Clinical Management:WHO supported MSPP to conduct field missions to Artibonite and Centre Departments. The field missions aimed to assess the quality of services provided in Cholera Treatment Centres (CTCs), the capacity for scaling up case management, and to determine the needs and gaps for the cholera response.WHO continues to provide essential medicines and medical supplies to the Health Directorates in all 10 departments by land and air, with 49 tons of supplies, such as ringer lactate, oral rehydration salts and infusion sets delivered in the last 15 days.In addition, WHO continues to support the MSPP in the coordination and quality assessment for Cholera Treatment Centers (CTCs). Currently, there are 70 active CTCs throughout the country: 22 in Ouest (including the CTC of the Civil Prison), 11 in Artibonite, eight in Sud and 6 in Sud-Est,, six in Grand\u2019 Anse, six in Nord,\u00a0 4 in Nord-Est, 4 in Nord-Ouest, two in Centre, one in Nippes.\u00a0\u00a0Access to safe WASH facilities:Training of the departmental health officials have been conducted on cholera outbreak response at the community level An investigation of WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) conditions in cholera hotspots have been conducted.Risk Communication and Community Engagement: In Haiti, WHO produced and distributed over 90 000 printed brochures and posters with cholera prevention messages in the Ouest Department, with the support of partner agencies and NGOs. WHO, in coordination with UNICEF and the Communications Unit of the Ministry of Health (MSPP), developed a communication strategy to support the cholera vaccination campaign.Reactive Vaccination Campaigns: As a part of the outbreak response, an emergency reactive vaccination campaign of Oral Cholera Vaccination (OCV) has been authorized by MSPP. The country applied to the International Coordinating Group (ICG) for OCV vaccine provision. The ICG partially approved the request for 1.6 million doses of OCV for implementation of the reactive vaccination campaign.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "The current cholera outbreak in Haiti, combined with the ongoing crisis related to gang violence, social unrest, and insecurity, has strained the health system\u2019s response capacity. The overall risk for this outbreak in Hispaniola is assessed as very high, due to the following reasons:The current socio-economic situation, ongoing humanitarian crisis, food insecurity and poor health conditions are affecting a large proportion of the population, leaving them vulnerable to the risk of cholera infection and recurrence of cholera. Limited access of the general population to safe drinking water and to sanitation facilities.Due to violence and insecurity, the public health system and international partners have limited human resources in Haiti, reducing the capacity to respond.Logistics issues, lack of access to fuel and insecurity lead to difficulties to import supplies and challenges to access the affected areas. Therefore, timely assessment of the epidemiological situation is complex. Additionally, for the same reasons the shipment of biological samples from healthcare facilities to reference laboratories is hampered. These challenges further increase the risk of undetected cases and delayed response efforts. The insecurity and access to fuel hinders the population's access to health care, leading to delayed treatment and potentially severe outcome.Considering the magnitude and wide spread of the cholera epidemic that is ongoing in Haiti, in conjunction with the complex humanitarian crisis the country is currently facing, the limited resources to control the epidemic, as well as the constant migration flows towards the Dominican Republic, the risk in Hispaniola is assessed as very high.In the Region of the Americas, considering the constant migration flow from Haiti to the countries and territories of the Region of the Americas, the heterogeneous capacity of the States Parties to detect and respond to cholera outbreaks, as well as the burnout of health workers from concurrent public health emergencies, the regional risk is assessed as moderate.The risk posed by the event on the Island of Hispaniola (Haiti and the Dominican Republic) at the global level is assessed as low.WHO will continue to evaluate the epidemiological situation.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO recommends improving access to proper and timely case management of cholera cases, improving access to safe drinking water and sanitation infrastructure, as well as improving infection, prevention, and control in healthcare facilities. These measures along with the promotion of preventive hygiene practices and food safety in affected communities are the most effective means of controlling cholera. OCV should be used in conjunction with improvements in water and sanitation to control cholera outbreaks and for prevention in targeted areas known to be at high risk for cholera as recommended by the Global task force for cholera control (GTFCC). Key public health communication messages should be provided to the population.Given the re-emergence of cholera in Haiti and the imported cases reported in the Dominican Republic, WHO recommends that Member States strengthen and maintain cholera surveillance in order to prevent and respond in a timely manner to possible imported cases or outbreaks. WHO does not recommend any restrictions on international travel or trade to or from Hispaniola based on the currently available information.",

According to information shared by the Ministry of Health, the new case was a stillborn baby delivered at 28 weeks of gestation. The mother was infected with SUDV while pregnant and had since recovered and was in good condition at the time of delivery.Since the outbreak declaration on 20 September, to 5 December 2022, a total of 142 confirmed cases have been reported by the Uganda Ministry of Health. Among them, 55 deaths occurred leading to a CFR of 39%. In addition, 22 probable cases (all are deaths) have been also reported. The number of cases among healthcare workers (HCWs) remains unchanged since the last DON report, with 19 confirmed cases, and seven deaths.On 2 December, Uganda health authorities announced that all patients have been discharged from Ebola treatment units (ETUs) and that no more cases are currently hospitalized. As of 5 December, there are no active cases.As of 5 December 2022, out of 2564 contacts listed, 2167 (84.5%), have completed the 21-day follow-up period.

        "Public Health Response": "For further information on the public health response in Uganda by the Ministry of Health, WHO and partners, see the latest situation reports jointly published by the Ministry of Health and the WHO Regional Office for Africa: https://www.afro.who.int/countries/publications?country=879.Following a Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) Request for Assistance, as of 7 December, there have been 66 offers of support received from 23 partner institutions. Five experts are currently deployed through GOARN in the functions of case management, infection prevention and control and Go.Data implementation. Additional offers of support have been received for the functions of water, sanitation and hygiene (WaSH), epidemiology and surveillance, partner coordination and laboratory capacities. In addition to the GOARN Request for Assistance, partners continue to support the Ministry of Health led response across multiple areas. WHO held expert consultations to identify candidate therapeutics and vaccines for inclusion in trials throughout October and November 2022 and developed clinical trial protocols for both vaccine and therapeutic candidates against Sudan ebolavirus. The experts recommended that three candidate vaccines should be included in the planned ring vaccination trial: VSV-SUDV from Merck/IAVI, ChAd3-SUDV from the Sabin Vaccine Institute, and biEBOV from Oxford University/Jenner Institute. On 8 December, 1200 doses of one of these candidate vaccines arrived in the country and will be evaluated in a clinical trial.WHO is working closely with partners on the \u2018accelerated campaign\u2019 in Kampala, carrying out Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE) activities. A festive season RCCE plan was developed to orient RCCE activities in Uganda and prevention in neighboring countries during this period.WHO continues to support the Uganda MoH and collaborate with partners to implement Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) measures in health facilities to prevent onward transmission including development of a national IPC strategy for SUDV response, implementation of screening, isolation and notification of suspect cases and health worker trainings. The IPC ring approach has been implemented and remains in place to support facilities and communities in the event of a confirmed case is reported.Preparedness and operational readiness in neighboring countriesWHO has revised the prioritization of the surrounding countries after conducting a risk assessment. In addition to the six surrounding countries (Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, South Sudan, Rwanda and Tanzania) that were assessed to be at-risk, five additional countries, with important population movements to and from Uganda, have been included, namely Central African Republic, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Somalia, and Sudan. The Ministries of Health, WHO, in-country and international partners, are supporting SUDV preparedness and operational readiness activities in these countries.\u00a0Summary of the country\u2019s preparedness and operational readiness activities (no new updates for Djibouti, Somalia and Sudan):Burundi continues to strengthen its surveillance at points of entry and is prepositioning infection prevention and control materials at the district level. The MoH has also received international experts in the areas of case management and IPC. Efforts to scale up the functionalities of points of entry and Ebola treatment centers continue as well as public communication and sensitizations.Central African Republic is conducting screening and all alerts are being investigated. The national Emergency Operation Center has been activated, and the national Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan is being finalized.Democratic Republic of the Congo continue to conduct screenings at 42 points of entry including airports, seaports, and ground crossings. Samples have been collected from suspect cases and resulted negative for SVD. The MoH is conducting surveillance, case management and IPC trainings of all staff deployed to at-risk health zones.Ethiopia has been on alert mode since September 2022. The MoH is in the process of conducting the SUDV readiness assessment to identify challenges and gaps to increase its readiness capacities. At international airport, screening activities continue.Kenya is planning on participating in a simulation exercise. In addition, a training course was held on case management at national and subnational levels. The MoH has also completed the SUDV readiness assessment and reports gained capacities in response and will continue scaling up its efforts to address challenges and gaps.Rwanda continues to conduct screenings and investigating all alerts. There are no reports of SUDV cases in the country. The MoH is coordinating readiness activities at national and subnational levels. A trainer-of-trainers workshop will be conducted in the coming week on digitalized community-based surveillance for community health workers. As well, trainings on case management and safe and dignified burial will be in mid-December in high-risk districts. South Sudan reports having conducted screening in Juba and Nimule. All 28 alerts have been investigated and all are negative for SVD. Rapid response teams and health care workers in laboratory procedures are being trained in Juba and Yambio next week. United Republic of Tanzania has increased its readiness activities in the past two weeks by strengthening its call centers, and increasing screenings at points of entry. All alerts have been investigated and are negative for SVD.On 6 December, WHO Regional Office for Africa in partnership with Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, West African Health Organization, United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, UK Health Security Agency, Robert Koch Institute and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, implemented a two-day public health emergency operation centre (PHEOC) simulation exercise with 36 countries in the WHO African Region, to improve readiness to respond to public health emergencies.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "On 4 November 2022, WHO revised the rapid risk assessment for this event from high to very high at the national level, and from low to high at the regional level, while the risk remained low at the global level. As of 8 December 2022, WHO\u2019s assessment of risk remains unchanged. The risk will be continuously assessed based on available and shared information.",
        "WHO Advice": "Successful SUDV disease outbreak control relies on applying a package of interventions, including case management, community engagement, surveillance and contact tracing, strengthening laboratory capacity, safe and dignified burials.Health-care workers should always take standard precautions when caring for patients, regardless of their presumed diagnosis. Implementation of IPC measures in health care (e.g., hand hygiene, training of health workers, adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies, waste management, environmental cleaning, and disinfection etc.) with ongoing monitoring and supervision for implementation is required to reduce risks of health care facilities amplifying the outbreak. Ensuring the provision of safe and dignified burials, supporting IPC in community settings (including adequate WASH facilities, hand hygiene capacity and safe waste management) and community engagement and social mobilization are essential to prevent and mitigate ongoing transmission.Upon case identification, early diagnosis and early initiation of supportive treatment has been shown to significantly improve survival. There are currently no proven therapeutics for SUDV but candidate therapeutics are available and due to be used in randomized controlled trials.\u00a0 Care of SUDV patients should occur in safely designed isolation and treatment/care centers with trained health workers. Establishing active surveillance at points of entry is an essential component of the outbreak response to mitigate the risk of international spread due to the high cross-border mobility between Uganda and neighbouring countries.There are no licensed vaccines for SUDV, but there are candidate vaccines which are going be used in trials.WHO advises against any restrictions on travel and/or trade to Uganda based on available information for the current outbreak.",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "As of 20 November 2022, a total of 52 807 laboratory-confirmed dengue cases and 230 related deaths have been reported by the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare of Bangladesh since 1 January 2022 with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 0.44%. Dengue is endemic in Bangladesh however a surge of cases started in June 2022. Currently, all eight divisions in the country are reporting cases and deaths. This is the second-largest outbreak since 2000, with the largest having occurred in 2019. The current dengue outbreak is unusual in its scale and seasonality.",
        "Description of the Situation": "Between 1 January and 20 November 2022, a total of 52\u00a0807 dengue cases including 230 related deaths (case fatality rate = 0.44%) were reported by the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare (MOHFW) (Figure 1). The cases were confirmed either by non-structural protein (NS1) diagnostic kits or by Immunoglobulin M (IgM) tests. According to information available for 40% of reported cases (n=20\u00a0982) the median age is 25 years (range: 0 \u2013 89) with males accounting for 60% of the cases. This is the second highest annual number of cases since 2000, the highest having occurred in 2019, when 101 354 cases including 164 deaths were reported (Figure 2 & 3).The most affected division is Dhaka, accounting for 70.6% of cases and 60.4% of deaths. Dhaka city, the largest city in Bangladesh, located in Dhaka division, has reported 64.5% (n= 34\u00a0071) of the total number of cases. Other affected divisions include Chattogram division (13.2% of cases and 24.8% of deaths) and Khulna division (5.5% of cases and 4.8% of deaths) (Figure 4).The high incidence of dengue cases this year is taking place in the context of an unusual amount of rainfall since June 2022, accompanied by high temperatures and high humidity which have resulted in an increased mosquito population throughout Bangladesh.

        "Epidemiology": "Dengue is a viral infection transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes and is found in tropical and sub-tropical climates worldwide, mostly in urban and semi-urban areas. The primary vectors that transmit the disease are\u00a0Aedes aegypti\u00a0mosquitoes and, to a lesser extent,\u00a0Aedes albopictus.Dengue virus (DENV) has four serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4) and it is possible to be infected by each. Infection with one serotype provides long-term immunity to the homologous serotype but not to the other serotypes; sequential infections put people at greater risk for severe dengue. Many DENV infections produce only mild illness; over 80% of cases are asymptomatic. DENV can cause an acute flu-like illness.There is no specific treatment for dengue; however, timely detection of cases, identifying any warning signs of severe dengue infection, and appropriate case management are key elements of care to prevent patient death and can lower fatality rates of severe infection to below 1%.Dengue was first recorded in the 1960s in Bangladesh (then East Pakistan) and was known as \u201cDacca fever\u201d. The establishment of the\u00a0Aedes aegypti\u00a0mosquito vector and urban cycles have made dengue endemic in Bangladesh. The growth factor of dengue cases since 2010 appeared to be linked to regional rainfall patterns (May to September) and is coincidental with higher environmental temperatures. Bangladesh\u2019s climate conditions are becoming more favorable for the transmission of dengue and other vector-borne diseases like malaria and chikungunya due to excessive rainfall, waterlogging, flooding, rise in temperature and the unusual shifts in the country\u2019s traditional seasons.",
        "Public Health Response": "The Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) has taken the following actions:Repurposed six COVID-19 dedicated hospitals in Dhaka city for dengue case managementEstablished dedicated dengue wards/dengue corners in Medical College hospitalsActivated Control Rooms in all district and Medical College hospitals for sharing awareness information and situation update with the stakeholders (including media and local leaders) to access the information locally availableConducted capacity-building activity on clinical case management by the inhouse trained facilitators at DGHS and trained 250 doctors and 300 nurses on clinical case management.\u00a0The MOHFW and WHO distributed a total of 284 000 non-structural protein (NS1) diagnostic kits to all the Upazila health complexes, district hospitals and Medical College hospitals in the country.Supplied adequate IV Saline and other supportive medicines for immediate response from the WHO-supported emergency buffer stock to health facilities all over the country. Blood banks are geared towards making platelets available for hemorrhagic dengue patients. Strengthened mass awareness campaigns \u2013 continued awareness through television and other mass media. The local ward counsellors have been trained in community awareness. The City Corporations carried out awareness programme and alerted building owners including buildings under construction to prevent water collection. Fines have been imposed on buildings where the Aedes larvae have been found. The local government engineering department (LGED) is leading vector control activities including the elimination of breeding sites and larvicidal and adult mosquito control using different insecticides such as Temephos and Deltamethrin among others.WHO supported pre-monsoon entomological survey through DFC, and is providing technical guidance to the outbreak response at the national level.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Bangladesh experienced a moderate rainfall during October this year which was unusual (monsoon is from May to September). Due to the untimely rainfall and favorable climate conditions, the density of the Aedes mosquito population is increasing. In addition, many people keep water in different containers like buckets and pots in their houses, enabling Aedes mosquitos to readily breed in such artificial collections of water. A pre-monsoon survey carried out by the health directorate earlier this year found a higher density of Aedes mosquitoes in the capital compared to 2021. Experts in the Communicable Disease Control (CDC) unit of the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) predicted a worsening dengue situation this year in Dhaka city unless preventive steps were taken. The CDC unit revealed its most recent monsoon survey in September and found that mosquito density was twice as high in Dhaka city as in the pre-monsoon survey.Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection caused by four dengue virus serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4). The predominant currently circulating serotype in Bangladesh is unknown at this stage, but limited serotyping has detected dengue virus 3 (DENV-3) and dengue virus 4 (DENV-4). DENV-3 has been consistently predominant since 2019 but DEN-4 has not been reported for several years. Dengue virus has the potential to cause epidemics resulting in high morbidity and mortality. There is no specific treatment. However, early recognition of dengue virus infection and appropriate clinical management can reduce disease severity and mortality among dengue patients. At present, the number of severe dengue cases and case-fatality rates appear to be increasing, likely due to late health-seeking behaviour and access issues. With the receding COVID-19 pandemic, the travel restrictions have been lifted. This has led to the movement of people to and from Dhaka. Although there have been concerted efforts by the Local Government Engineering Department (LGED), City Corporations, and the Ministry of Health towards curbing the dengue outbreak in Dhaka in the past few months, yet the continued movements have led to an inflow of possibly infected individuals with a potential to contribute to dengue transmission cycles. Vector control activities have been less intense in the other districts of Bangladesh. Dengue poses a significant public health concern for Bangladesh which experiences regular seasonal outbreaks of dengue. Furthermore, the clinical management of people who develop severe illnesses, often requiring hospital care, puts additional strain on an already overburdened healthcare system.",
        "WHO Advice": "The proximity of mosquito vector breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for dengue virus infection. Although dengue does not directly spread from human-to-human, Aedes species mosquitoes can become infected after biting dengue-infected individuals, thus creating a cycle of transmission capable of spreading dengue and leading to clusters of cases. The prevention and control of dengue depends on effective vector control. WHO promotes a strategic approach known as Integrated Vector Management (IVM) to control mosquito vectors, including the mosquito genus Aedes (the primary vector for dengue). IVM should be enhanced to remove potential breeding sites, reduce vector populations, and minimize individual exposure. This should involve vector control strategies for larvae and adults (i.e., environmental management and source reduction, biological control, and chemical control measures), as well as strategies for protecting people and households. Bangladesh should implement the IVM strategy developed in 2021. Vector control activities should focus on all areas where there is a risk of human-vector contact (place of residence, workplaces, schools and hospitals). Vector control activities can include covering, draining, and cleaning household water storage containers on a weekly basis. Space spraying with insecticide can be deployed as an emergency measure. Chlorination and application of suitable larvicides/insecticides for water storage in outdoor containers should also be considered. Personal protective measures during outdoor activities include the topical application of repellents to exposed skin or on clothing, and the use of long sleeve shirts and pants. Indoor protection can include the use of household insecticide aerosol products or mosquito coils. Window and door screens, as well as air conditioning, can reduce the probability of mosquitoes entering the house. Insecticide-treated nets offer good protection to people against mosquito bites while sleeping during the day. Since Aedes mosquitoes are active at dawn and dusk, personal protective measures are recommended particularly at these times of day. There is no specific treatment for dengue infection; however, early detection of cases, identifying any warning signs of severe dengue, and timely access to appropriate clinical management are key elements of care to reduce the risk for severe dengue complications and deaths due to dengue. Case surveillance should continue to be enhanced in all affected areas and across the country. Where feasible, resources should be allocated to the strengthening of laboratory sample referral mechanisms for the confirmation and sub-typing of the dengue virus. WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Bangladesh based on the information available for this event.",

        "Description of the Situation": "Source: Ministry of Health Uganda and WHO Situation ReportsSince the outbreak declaration on 20 September, a total of 141 confirmed cases and 55 confirmed deaths (CFR 39%) from Ebola disease caused by the Sudan ebolavirus (SUDV) have been reported by the Uganda Ministry of Health as of 21 November. In addition, 22 probable cases (all are deaths) have been reported since the beginning of the outbreak. Overall, 19 cases with seven deaths occurred among healthcare workers (HCWs).The weekly number of confirmed cases reported has decreased for the third consecutive week (Figure 1) after the peak observed in the week 17-23 October. During the week commencing 7 November, five confirmed and one probable case was reported, including one confirmed case and one probable death from a newly affected district (Jinja), in the Eastern Region of Uganda, which is 80 km distant from Kampala. The most recent confirmed case was reported by the Uganda MoH on 14 November, from Kampala district.Figure 1.

Map of confirmed cases and deaths of Ebola disease caused by SUDV, by district, as of 21 November 2022. Although there is significant improvement in surveillance activities in most affected districts, contact tracing gaps have been reported in newly affected districts. The suboptimal performance could be attributed to different factors, such as the non-reporting of probable cases, high population mobility including the movement of non-listed and/or missing contacts, and initial gaps in human and material resources. Surveillance strengthening plans have been put in place in newly affected districts.\u00a0Since the beginning of the outbreak, 4652 contacts have been registered, of which 3599 (78%) have completed the 21-day follow-up period.As of 21 November, a total of 700 contacts in five districts (Jinja, Kampala, Kassanda, Masaka, and Mubende) were under active surveillance. In the week commencing 14 November, the average follow-up rate was 65%, representing a decrease of 26% in the follow-up rate as compared to 91% the previous week.

Following a Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) Request for Assistance, as of 22 November, there have been 52 offers of support received from 21 partner institutions. Six experts are currently deployed through GOARN in the functions of case management, partner coordination and infection prevention and control. Additional offers of support have been received for the functions of water, sanitation and hygiene (WaSH), epidemiology and surveillance, and laboratory capacities. In addition to the GOARN Request for Assistance, partners continue to support the Ministry of Health-led response across multiple areas. WHO held expert consultations to identify candidate therapeutics and vaccines for inclusion in trials throughout October and November 2022 and to draft clinical trial protocols for both vaccine and therapeutic candidates against Sudan ebolavirus. WHO also requested the existing COVID-19 Vaccine Prioritisation Working Group (WG) to extend its COVID-19 remit to rapidly evaluate the suitability of candidate SUDV vaccines for inclusion in the planned trial in Uganda using similar considerations on safety, potential efficacy and logistic issues relating to availability and implementation. The experts recommended that three candidate vaccines should be included in the planned ring vaccination trial: VSV-SUDV from Merck/IAVI, ChAd3-SUDV from the Sabin Institute, and biEBOV from Oxford University/Jenner Institute. The first doses of one of these vaccine candidates are expected to arrive in the country soon.Preparedness and operational readiness in neighboring countriesWHO has revised the prioritization of the surrounding countries after conducting a risk assessment. In addition to the six surrounding countries that were assessed to be at-risk, five additional countries are being included, namely Central African Republic, Ethiopia, Somalia, Sudan and Djibouti. These countries have important population movements to and from Uganda. WHO has started to engage with these countries and will report their readiness activities in the next DON report.The Ministries of Health of the six neighboring countries (Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, and the United Republic of Tanzania), in-country and international partners, and WHO are supporting SUDV readiness actions. \u00a0Burundi is scaling up its operational readiness by coordinating with provinces and districts on upcoming activities such as the reinforcement of points of entry bordering Tanzania and Rwanda. In addition, training of community health workers and health care workers have been on going to enhance surveillance activities. As of 21 November, all alerts have been investigated and resulted negative for SUDV.Democratic Republic of the Congo has been focusing their readiness efforts on training staff at points of entry. As of 21 November, 98% of travelers at airports are being screened. In addition, the health zones have been strengthening their capacities in laboratory and case management. As of 21 November, all alerts have been investigated and resulted negative for SUDV.Kenya is strengthening their capacities in case management through conducting trainer-of-trainers and holding a comprehensive simulation exercise with WHO\u2019s support. \u00a0Points of entry at high-risk counties have been conducting screenings as well. As of 21 November, all alerts have been investigated and resulted negative for SUDV.Rwanda is updating its contingency plan to guide the efforts in scaling up its readiness capabilities. Specifically, there are advancements in the establishment of Ebola Treatment Units (ETUs). The Ministry of Health is also reinforcing its core capacities in infection prevention and control and case management. Specifically, WHO is developing and implementing a training package in case management. As of 21 November, all alerts have been investigated and resulted negative for SUDV.South Sudan has been enhancing its capacities in the areas of surveillance, case management and infection prevention and control. Health care workers at the subnational level have been undergoing trainings on SUDV management at health facilities. In addition, this past week, sensitization trainings for SUDV stakeholders have been completed. As of 21 November, all alerts have been investigated and resulted negative for SUDV.United Republic of Tanzania has conducted training in the areas of IPC including safe and dignified burials. Health promoters have completed trainings in risk communication and community engagement and in mental health and psychosocial support. As of 21 November, all alerts have been investigated and resulted negative for SUDV.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "On 4 November 2022, WHO revised the risk assessment for this event from high to very high at the national level, and from low to high at the regional level, while the risk remained low at the global level.The risk will be continuously assessed based on available and shared information.",
        "WHO Advice": "Successful SUDV disease outbreak control relies on applying a package of interventions, including case management, community engagement, surveillance and contact tracing, strengthening laboratory capacity, safe and dignified burials.Health-care workers should always take standard precautions when caring for patients, regardless of their presumed diagnosis. Implementation of IPC measures in health care (e.g., hand hygiene, training of health workers, adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies, waste management, environmental cleaning, and disinfection etc.) with ongoing monitoring and supervision for implementation is required to reduce risks of health care facilities amplifying the outbreak. Ensuring the provision of safe and dignified burials, supporting IPC in community settings (including adequate WASH facilities, hand hygiene capacity and safe waste management) and community engagement and social mobilization are essential to prevent and mitigate ongoing transmission.Upon case identification, early initiation of supportive treatment has been shown to significantly improve survival.Establishing active surveillance at points of entry is an essential component of the outbreak response to mitigate the risk of international spread due to the high cross-border mobility between Uganda and neighbouring countries.There are no licensed vaccines for SUDV, but there are candidate vaccines which are due to be used in trials.WHO advises against any restrictions on travel and/or trade to Uganda based on available information for the current outbreak.",

        "Date Reported": "16 November 2022",
        "Location": "Saudi Arabia",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "From 29 December 2021 to 31 October 2022, four laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) were reported to WHO by the Ministry of Health of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. No deaths were reported. Household contacts for the four cases were followed-up by the Ministry of Health, and no secondary cases were identified. The notification of these cases reiterates the need for global awareness of MERS-CoV but does not change the overall risk assessment.",
        "Description of the Situation": "Since the last Disease Outbreaks News on MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia published on 7 April 2022, the IHR National Focal Point of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has reported four additional cases, with no associated deaths. Between 29 December 2021 and 31 October 2022, four cases of locally acquired Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection were reported from Riyadh (two cases), Gassim (one case), and Makka Al Mukarramah (one case) regions (Figure 1). Laboratory confirmation of the cases was performed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). All the cases were non-health-care workers, who presented with fever, cough, and shortness of breath, and had comorbidities. Three of the cases had a history of contact with dromedary camels and consumption of their raw milk in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. Three of the cases were male and the overall age range is 23 to 74-year-old.Since the first report of MERS-CoV in 2012, a total of 2600 cases with 935 associated deaths have been reported from 27 countries, in all six WHO regions. The majority of MERS-CoV cases (n=2193; 84%) resulting in 854 deaths, have been reported from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (Figure 2).Figure 1. Geographical distribution of MERS-CoV cases between 29 December 2021 \u2013 31 October 2022 by city and region, Saudi Arabia (n=4). Table 1. MERS-CoV cases reported between 29 December 2021 \u2013 31 October 2022\u00a0 Figure 2: Distribution of cases and deaths from MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia from 2013 to 20221",
        "Epidemiology": "Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory infection caused by a coronavirus called Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Approximately 36% of patients with MERS have died, but this may be an overestimate of the true mortality rate, as mild cases of MERS-CoV may be missed by existing surveillance systems, with case fatality rates counted only amongst the laboratory-confirmed cases.Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedary camels who are the natural host and zoonotic source of the virus. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts and in healthcare settings. Outside of the healthcare setting, there has been limited human-to-human transmission.MERS-CoV infections range from showing no symptoms (asymptomatic) or mild respiratory symptoms to severe acute respiratory disease and death. A typical presentation of MERS-CoV disease is fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Pneumonia is a common finding, but not always present. Gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhoea, have also been reported. Severe illness can cause respiratory failure that requires mechanical ventilation and support in an intensive care unit. The virus appears to cause more severe disease in older people, persons with weakened immune systems and those with comorbidities or chronic diseases such as renal disease, cancer, chronic lung disease, and diabetes.No vaccine or specific treatment is currently available, although several MERS-CoV-specific vaccines and treatments are in development. Treatment is supportive and based on the patient\u2019s clinical condition and symptoms.",
        "Public Health Response": "Follow-up of the household contacts was conducted for all four cases, and no secondary cases were identified.For the three cases reporting contact with camels, the Ministry of Agriculture was informed, and an investigation of camels was conducted. The identified positive camels were isolated. The Ministry of Health of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is working to improve testing capacities for better detection of MERS-CoV during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Between September 2012 and 17 October 2022, the total number of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection cases reported globally to WHO is 2600 with 935 associated deaths. Most of these cases have occurred in countries in the Arabian Peninsula. There has been one large outbreak outside of the Middle East in May 2015, during which 186 laboratory-confirmed cases (185 in the Republic of Korea and 1 in China) and 38 deaths were reported, however, the index case in that outbreak had a travel history to the Middle East. The global number reflects the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases reported to WHO under IHR (2005) to date. The total number of deaths includes the deaths that WHO is aware of to date through follow-up with affected Member States.The notification of the four cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East and/or other countries where MERS-CoV is circulating in dromedaries, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who were exposed to the virus through contact with dromedaries or their products (for example, consumption of camel\u2019s raw milk), or in a healthcare setting. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessments based on the latest available information.\u00a0 The number of MERS-CoV cases reported to WHO has substantially declined since the beginning of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This is likely the result of epidemiological surveillance activities for COVID-19 being prioritized, resulting in reduced testing and detection of MERS-CoV cases. In addition, measures taken during the COVID-19 pandemic to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission (e.g. mask-wearing, hand hygiene, physical distancing, improving the ventilation of indoor spaces, respiratory etiquette, stay-at-home orders, reduced mobility) are also likely reduce opportunities for onward human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV. However, the circulation of MERS-CoV in dromedary camels is not likely to have been impacted by these measures. Therefore, while the number of reported secondary cases of MERS has been reduced, the risk of zoonotic transmission remains.",
        "WHO Advice": "Based on the current situation and available information, WHO re-emphasizes the importance of strong surveillance by all Member States for acute respiratory infections, including MERS-CoV, and to carefully investigate any unusual patterns. Human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV in healthcare settings has been associated with delays in recognizing the early symptoms of MERS-CoV infection, slow triage of suspected cases and delays in implementing infection, prevention and control (IPC) measures. IPC measures are therefore critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV between people in health care facilities. Healthcare workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, at every interaction in healthcare settings. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol-generating procedures or in settings where aerosol-generating procedures are conducted. Early identification, case management and isolation of cases, follow-up and quarantine of contacts, together with appropriate IPC measures in health care setting and public health awareness can prevent human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV. MERS-CoV appears to cause more severe disease in people with underlying chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons. Therefore, people with these underlying medical conditions should avoid close contact with animals, particularly dromedaries, when visiting farms, markets, race tracks or slaughterhouses where the virus may be circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to. Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid handling or consuming raw camel milk or camel urine or eating meat that has not been properly cooked. WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry regarding this event, nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.",

        "Description of the Situation": "From when the outbreak was declared on 20 September until 7 November, a total of 136 confirmed cases and 53 confirmed deaths (CFR 38.9%) from Ebola disease caused by the Sudan ebolavirus (SUDV) have been reported, representing an increase of 18% and 66% respectively since the last DON published on 28 October 2022. In addition, 21 probable deaths have been also reported since the beginning of the outbreak, with the last probable death notified on 29 September. Three additional cases and three additional deaths have been reported among healthcare workers since 28 October, resulting in a total of 18 cases and seven deaths among these workers.Since the last DON, one newly affected district has been reported (Masaka), leading to a total of eight districts reporting cases. The most affected district remains Mubende with 63 (46%) confirmed cases and 29 (55%) confirmed deaths, followed by Kassanda with 46 (34%) confirmed cases and 19 (36%) confirmed deaths. Two districts, Bunyangabu and Kagadi, have not reported cases for more than 40 days.As of 7 November, a total of 1386 contacts in seven districts are currently under surveillance, with a follow-up rate of 92%. In the week commencing 31 October, an average of 1586 contacts were followed up daily, a\u00a0 decrease of 16% from the previous week (week commencing 24 October) when a daily average of 1896 contacts were followed up. A total of 34 contacts developed symptoms during the past week. Since the beginning of the outbreak, 3867 contacts have been registered, of which 2237 (68%) have completed the 21-day follow-up period.As of 7 November, at least 2835 alerts have been received at a daily average of 71 alerts. Approximately 94% (n=2671) of all alerts received were investigated within 24 hours, of which 1120 were validated as suspected cases. The proportion of alerts investigated within 24 hours has been steadily increasing, and in the week commencing 31 October, nearly all alerts (657/659) were investigated within 24 hours, of which 31% (n=203) were validated as suspected cases.Since the beginning of the outbreak, a total of 2139 samples were collected (suspects, repeat samples, swabs), of which 419 in the week commencing on 31 October (+11% increase as compared to the previous week when 377 samples were collected and tested).Figure 1.

        "Public Health Response": "For further information on the public health response in Uganda by the Ministry of Health, WHO and partners, see the latest situation reports jointly published by the Ministry of Health and the WHO Regional Office for Africa: https://www.afro.who.int/countries/publications?country=879.Partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) have deployed staff to support the response activities in Uganda, primarily for case management, infection prevention and control and WASH, epidemiology and surveillance, laboratory, Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE) and Safe and Dignified Burials (SDBs). \u00a0Preparedness and operational readiness in neighboring countriesThe Ministry of Health in the six neighboring countries (Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, and the United Republic of Tanzania), in-country and international partners, and WHO are supporting SUDV readiness actions. These include the activation of multi-sectoral coordination mechanisms for SUDV; refresher training of rapid response teams; refresher laboratory training; infection prevention and control at health care facilities; activation/strengthening of surveillance systems for SUDV; community engagement and risk communication; screenings at points of entry (PoE) and assessment and reinforcement of case management capacities, among other activities.Countries are requested to cascade the operational readiness activities to sub-national levels in high-risk districts/states to stop the introduction of SUDV into their communities. A new online preparedness assessment tool has been developed to measure key performance indicators to quantify and document the functionality of preparedness capacities in multiple high-risk districts in Uganda and six countries neighboring Uganda to facilitate real-time monitoring of the actual readiness status.In addition, external stakeholders in these six countries will jointly assess preparedness. The Joint Assessment Missions (JAM) will evaluate preparedness at the national level as well as in high-risk subnational-level districts/states. The JAM reports will provide a detailed picture of preparedness capacities in all pillars and in all subnational areas that are at risk.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "On 1 November 2022, WHO revised the risk assessment for this event from high to very high at the national level, and from low to high at the regional level, while the risk remained low at the global level.The estimated very high risk at the national level is based on a combination of several factors including the lack of licensed medical countermeasures; the late detection of the SUDV outbreak and its spread to multiple districts (including to larger cities like Kampala, with a population of more than four million people and travel connections to many neighbouring countries); a highly mobile population with reports of some high-risk contacts and symptomatic cases traveling between districts using public transportation; despite significant case-finding efforts, there is a possibility that some contacts may have been missed; reported challenges with community engagement in affected districts; many cases have presented at various health facilities with suboptimal infection prevention and control (IPC) practices.The current outbreak is the first outbreak of Sudan ebolavirus in Uganda since 2012. Uganda has developed an increased capacity to respond to Ebola outbreaks over recent years and has a local capacity mobilized and organized with available resources to provide a robust response, but the system could be overwhelmed if the number of cases continues to rise and the outbreak spreads to other densely populated districts, as the country is simultaneously responding to multiple emergencies including outbreaks of anthrax, COVID-19, Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever, Rift Valley fever and yellow fever, as well as prevailing food insecurity.At the regional level, the risk has been assessed as high due to the lack of licensed vaccines and therapeutics, mass population movements within and across neighbouring countries, along with weak cross-border surveillance that further amplifies the risk of disease spread, and health systems that respond to multiple emergencies.The risk will be continuously assessed based on available and shared information.",
        "WHO Advice": "Successful SUDV outbreak control relies on applying a package of interventions, including clinical management, community engagement, surveillance and contact tracing, and strengthening laboratory capacity.Implementation of IPC measures in health care (e.g., hand hygiene, training of health workers, adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies, waste management, environmental cleaning, and disinfection etc.) with ongoing monitoring and supervision for implementation is required to reduce risks of health care facilities amplifying the outbreak. Ensuring the provision of safe and dignified burials, supporting IPC in community settings (including adequate WASH facilities, hand hygiene capacity and safe waste management) and community engagement and social mobilization are essential to prevent and mitigate ongoing transmission.Upon case identification, early initiation of supportive treatment has been shown to significantly reduce deaths from SUDV.Establishing active surveillance at points of entry is an essential component of the outbreak response to mitigate the risk of international spread due to the high cross-border mobility between Uganda and neighbouring countries.WHO advises against any restrictions on travel and/or trade to Uganda based on available information for the current outbreak.",

        "Date Reported": "7 November 2022",
        "Location": "Malawi",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "Cholera is endemic in Malawi with seasonal outbreaks reported during the wet season. Since 1998, cholera cases have been reported in the country with significant morbidity and mortality in affected populations, especially in the southern region, which is low-lying, flat, and prone to flooding during the rainy season.\nThe current outbreak, which started in March 2022 has affected 27 of 29 districts of Malawi and represents the largest outbreak reported in the country in the past ten years. The outbreak is taking place in the context of tropical storm Ana (January 2022) and Cyclone Gombe (March 2022) which caused floods leading to the displacement of a population with low pre-existing immunity that now lacks access to safe water, sanitation, and hygiene.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 3 March 2022, the Ministry of Public Health of Malawi notified WHO of a cholera outbreak after laboratory confirmation of a cholera case in Machinga district hospital on 2 March 2022. Between 3 March through 31 October 2022, a cumulative total of 6056 cases including 183 deaths have been reported from 27 of 29 districts in Malawi (overall case fatality rate (CFR) 3.0%) with active transmission ongoing in 23 districts as of 31 October. Five districts account for 79% of the reported cases and 68% of the deaths: Nkhata Bay (1128 cases and 31 deaths), Nkhotakota (811 cases and 40 deaths), Rumphi (783 cases and 13 deaths), Karonga (683 cases and 14 deaths), and Blantyre (650 with 26 deaths). The outbreak originated in the Southern region of Malawi with cases reported in Nsanje and Machinga districts. Currently, the most affected districts in Malawi are in the Northern part of the country. The most affected age groups are 21-30 years, and males are disproportionately affected.\u00a0Figure 1.

Distribution of confirmed and suspected cholera cases (n=6056) by age group and gender in Malawi, 1 January to 31 October 2022Source: Malawi Ministry of Health and Population",
        "Epidemiology": "Cholera is an acute enteric infection caused by ingesting the bacteria\u00a0Vibrio cholerae\u00a0present in contaminated water or food. It is mainly linked to inadequate sanitation and insufficient access to safe drinking water. It is an extremely virulent disease that can cause severe acute watery diarrhoea resulting in high morbidity and mortality, and can spread rapidly, depending on the frequency of exposure, the exposed population and the setting. Cholera affects both children and adults and can be fatal within hours if untreated.The incubation period is between12 hours and five days after ingestion of contaminated food or water. Most people infected with\u00a0V. cholerae\u00a0do not develop any symptoms, although the bacteria are present in their faeces for 1-10 days after infection and are shed back into the environment, potentially infecting other people. The majority of people who develop symptoms have mild or moderate symptoms, while a minority develop acute watery diarrhoea and vomiting with severe dehydration. Cholera is an easily treatable disease. Most people can be treated successfully through prompt administration of oral rehydration solution (ORS).The consequences of a humanitarian crisis \u2013 such as disruption of water and sanitation systems, or the displacement of populations towards inadequate and overcrowded camps \u2013 can increase the risk of cholera transmission, should the bacteria be present or introduced.A multi-sectoral approach including a combination of surveillance, water, sanitation and hygiene (WaSH), social mobilization, treatment, and oral cholera vaccines is essential to control cholera outbreaks and to reduce deaths.",
        "Public Health Response": "Emergency response activities are being conducted by the Ministry of Health, WHO and other partners since the declaration of the outbreak in March 2022.Coordination and response: A costed national cholera response plan has been drafted to manage the outbreak. WHO and other partners are supporting the implementation of various activities aligned with the plan. National and district-level emergency operation centres (EOCs) have been operationalized to coordinate the response in collaboration with other health sectors and partners.\u00a0Surveillance: National rapid response teams (RRT) have been deployed to the affected districts.Surge staff have been deployed and additional staff have been hired to strengthen surveillance and case management in affected districts.Active case search for suspected cholera cases is ongoing in communities in all affected districts.\u00a0Health System Strengthening: Cholera kits and other supplies including oral rehydration salt, IV Fluids, antibiotics, rapid diagnostic test kits, personal protective equipment, tents, and cholera beds have been provided by WHO in affected districts. Supplies for case management and laboratory confirmation of cholera are being distributed to health facilities and the district laboratories although additional supplies are needed. Case management has been strengthened through the establishment of treatment structures and the provision of equipment. Treatment structures have been established in affected districts and private facilities have been engaged to facilitate prompt referrals.Cross-border meetings are held with health officials in Mozambique and Zambia.Reactive Vaccination Campaigns: As a part of the outbreak response, reactive vaccination campaigns of Oral Cholera Vaccination (OCV) were implemented in eight districts (Balaka, Blantyre, Chikwawa, Nsanje, Mangochi, Mulanje, Machinga, Phalombe) between 23 to 27 May 2022, targeting individuals aged one year and older. Cumulative coverage of 69% was achieved but in Blantyre district the coverage was 42%. In Neno district, two campaigns were implemented in August 2022 with 84% and 72% coverage achieved in each round respectively.The country applied to the International Coordinating Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision for OCV vaccines and has been awarded 2.9 million doses for use in areas with ongoing\u00a0outbreaks. Preparations towards a reactive campaign have been initiated.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Cholera is endemic in Malawi with seasonal outbreaks occurring during the wet season. The first major outbreak occurred in 1998 and was widespread in the southern region, with 25 000 cases reported. The country reported its largest outbreak occurring from October 2001 to April 2002, which affected 26 of the 29 districts, with 33 546 cases and 968 deaths (CFR 3%). A more recent outbreak occurred in 2019 \u2013 2020 with a total of 26 cases and one death. Since the beginning of 2022, 27 districts have reported cholera cases. The outbreak was largely confined to the south of the country, including the areas affected by the cyclones until after July 2022, when the outbreak spread to the North of the country resulting in a surge in cases. This upsurge in the number of cases is being reported during the country\u2019s dry season when normally there is low or no transmission of cholera in Malawi. The upcoming rainy season in November poses the threat of further disease spread nationwide.There is a continued risk for further increases in the number of cases and international spread. Confirmed cases had been reported across the border in Mozambique during the initial period of the current outbreak. In late September, a cholera outbreak was declared in Lago district in Mozambique which borders Malawi (through Lake Malawi). Currently, the most affected districts in Malawi are in the Northern part of the country some of which are on the border with Tanzania and Zambia. There is significant cross-border movement in the region with bordering countries and beyond. Given the history of cross-border spread of cholera during this outbreak, WHO considers the risk of further spread of the disease very high at national and regional level.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO recommends improving access to proper and timely case management of cholera cases, improving access to safe drinking water and sanitation infrastructure, as well as improving infection, prevention, and control in healthcare facilities. These measures along with the promotion of preventive hygiene practices and food safety in affected communities are the most effective means of controlling cholera. Targeted public health communication messages are a key element for a successful campaign.OCV should be used in conjunction with improvements in water and sanitation to control cholera outbreaks and for prevention in targeted areas known to be at high risk for cholera.  WHO recommends Member States to strengthen and maintain surveillance for cholera, especially at the community level, for the early detection of suspected cases and to provide adequate treatment and prevent its spread. Early and adequate treatment limits the CFR of hospitalized patients to less than 1%. WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions on Malawi based on the currently available information. However, as the outbreak is taking place in border areas where there is a significant cross-border movement, WHO encourages Malawi and its neighbouring countries to ensure cooperation and regular information sharing so that any spread across the border is quickly contained.",

        "Outbreak name": "Avian Influenza A (H5N1)",
        "Date Reported": "3 November 2022",
        "Location": "Spain",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "Public health authorities in Spain reported the detection of influenza A(H5N1) in two poultry workers on a single farm, following an outbreak in poultry confirmed on 20 September. Given the potential impact on public health, a multisector response including measures for control, prevention, and early detection was initiated in the poultry farm. The detection of influenza A(H5N1) in these individuals was likely due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. No evidence of human-to-human transmission of influenza A(H5N1) virus in this event has been identified to date.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 27 September 2022, the Ministry of Public Health of Spain notified WHO of a case of influenza A(H5N1) in an individual working at a poultry farm in the province of Guadalajara. An outbreak of avian influenza A(H5N1) in poultry had been confirmed on the farm on 20 September. Nasopharyngeal samples were subsequently collected from all 12 farm workers on 23 September and influenza A(H5N1) virus was detected in a sample from one of the workers (a 19-year-old male) on 27 September. He remained in isolation until 28 September when a second sample tested negative by RT-PCR. On 28 September, samples from one close contact of the case were collected, which tested negative for avian influenza by RT-PCR.Following response measures on the farm, all workers were tested again on 13 October. Influenza A(H5N1) virus was detected in a nasopharyngeal sample from another worker (a 27-year-old male involved in the control measures including cleaning and disinfection whilst wearing personal protection equipment) on 13 October. He had initially tested negative during the first round of testing on 23 September. He remained in isolation until 22 October when a second sample tested negative by RT-PCR. Two close contacts of his were identified and tested negative on respiratory sampling.Both cases did not have any symptoms. Samples were tested using RT-PCR at the National Microbiology Center.",
        "Epidemiology": "Zoonotic influenza infections in humans may range from asymptomatic or mild upper respiratory infection (fever and cough) to rapid progression to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, shock and even death.Human cases of infection with avian influenza viruses are usually the result of direct or indirect exposure to infected live or dead poultry or contaminated environments.From 2003 to 21 October 2022, a total of 868 human cases of infection with influenza A(H5N1), including these two cases, and 456 deaths have been reported globally from 21 countries. A total of three human cases of infection with influenza A (H5N1), one case from the United Kingdom in 2021 and two cases from Spain in 2022 have been reported in Europe to date.",
        "Public Health Response": "Coordination and response: A multisector response including measures for control, prevention, and early detection have been carried out in poultry farms according to the Practical Operations Manual of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Surveillance: A follow-up response including passive and active surveillance of exposed workers and close contacts has been initiated. Excluding the reported cases, all other individuals who were exposed at the affected poultry farm were monitored for seven days following the last day of exposure to infection and have not developed any symptoms. Laboratory: Virus characterization, and serological studies are in process. The samples from both cases were sent on 24 October 2022 to the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza at the Crick Worldwide Influenza Centre in London, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Infection prevention and control: In the affected farms, measures related to the control of the outbreak have been undertaken, including on-site slaughter of the birds, the destruction of contaminated materials that could carry the virus, and the cleaning and disinfection of the facilities. All participants involved in the culling process wore personal protective equipment.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Individuals are at risk of becoming infected with avian influenza viruses if they are exposed to infected birds or virus-contaminated fomites or environments.Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk for sporadic infection and small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. Therefore, sporadic human cases are not unexpected. The\u00a0detection of influenza A(H5) virus\u00a0in\u00a0nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal samples collected from\u00a0individuals in close contact with infected poultry or other birds, whether the individuals are symptomatic or not,\u00a0is\u00a0not unexpected.\u00a0Good quality serological investigations may be useful in\u00a0differentiating infection from contamination in these cases\u00a0and allow\u00a0for a better\u00a0assessment\u00a0of\u00a0the risk of\u00a0human infection.\u00a0\u00a0There was no evidence of human-to-human transmission in this event.In the current outbreak of HPAI A(H5N1) on a poultry farm in Spain, both human and animal health agencies have implemented public health measures. Based on the available information, WHO assesses that the risk for the general population posed by this virus is low, and for occupationally exposed persons, it is low to moderate.",
        "WHO Advice": "The reports of these two influenza A (H5N1) cases do not change the current WHO recommendations on public health measures and surveillance of influenza.WHO does not advise special traveler screening at points of entry or restrictions with regard to the current situation of influenza viruses at the human-animal interface.Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect and monitor virological, epidemiological, and clinical changes associated with emerging or circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health and timely virus sharing for risk assessment.When avian influenza viruses are circulating in an area, people involved in high-risk tasks such as sampling sick birds, culling, and disposing of infected birds, eggs, litters and cleaning of contaminated premises should be trained in the proper use of and provided with appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). All persons involved in these tasks should be registered and monitored closely by local health authorities for seven days following the last day of contact with poultry or their environments. In the case of a confirmed or suspected human infection caused by a novel influenza virus with pandemic potential, including a variant virus, a thorough epidemiologic investigation (even while awaiting the confirmatory laboratory results) of history of exposure to animals, of travel, and contact tracing should be conducted. The epidemiological investigation should include early identification of unusual respiratory events that could signal person-to-person transmission of the novel virus and clinical samples collected from the time and place that the case occurred should be tested and sent to a WHO Collaboration Centre for further characterization.Currently, there is no vaccine to protect against avian influenza in humans. WHO recommends that all people involved in work with poultry or birds should have a seasonal influenza vaccination to reduce the theoretical risk of a reassortment event. Travelers to countries with known outbreaks of animal influenza should avoid farms, contact with animals in live animal markets, entering areas where animals may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with animal faeces. General precautions include regular hand washing and good food safety and food hygiene practices. Should infected individuals from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during travel or after arrival. If this were to occur, further community-level spread is considered unlikely as this virus has not acquired the ability to transmit easily among humans.All human infections caused by a novel influenza subtype are notifiable under the International Health Regulations (IHR) and State Parties to the IHR (2005) are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic. Evidence of illness is not required for this report.",

        "Description of the Situation": "On 20 September 2022, the health authorities in the Republic of Uganda declared an outbreak of Ebola disease caused by Sudan ebolavirus (SUDV), after a case was confirmed in a village in Madudu sub-county in Mubende district, central Uganda on 19 September.As of 26 October, a total of 115 confirmed and 21 probable cases, including 32 confirmed and 21 probable deaths (CFR among confirmed cases: 27.8%) have been reported. Overall, 15 cases with four deaths have been reported among healthcare workers.As of 26 October, 1844 contacts were under surveillance in nine districts of the country. A cumulative total of 3166 contacts have been listed since the start of this outbreak, of which 1194 (37.7%) have completed the follow-up period of 21 days.A total of 94 safe and dignified burials (SDB) have been undertaken since the beginning of the outbreak, of which 97.9% (n=92) were community burials.Figure 1. Confirmed and probable cases of SVD by date of illness onset and outcome (dead/alive), 20 September \u2013 26 October 2022.The most affected district is Mubende, which has reported 54.7% (n=63) of all confirmed cases, and in particular Madudu sub-county with 21 confirmed cases reported (18.2% of all confirmed cases). Since the previous week (20 October 2022), two additional districts reported new cases, bringing the total number of affected districts to seven.Table 1.

Map of confirmed cases and deaths of Ebola disease caused by SUDV, by District, as of 26 October 2022.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "For further information about the public health response in Uganda by the Ministry of Health, WHO and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa: https://www.afro.who.int/countries/publications?country=879 Vaccine developmentWHO initiated international consultations with vaccine developers to identify vaccine candidates against the Sudan ebolavirus that could be tested in randomized clinical studies in Uganda. Three candidate vaccines under consideration: cAd3, cAdOX1, and rVSV SUDV GP. The clinical study protocols are under review by the ethical and regulatory committees in Uganda.At each stage of the clinical study, WHO prioritization committee will be reviewing evidence collected on the effectiveness and safety of the vaccine candidates to inform response activities.Preparedness and operational readiness in neighboring countriesThe Ministry of Health in the six neighboring countries (Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, and the United Republic of Tanzania), in-country and international partners, and WHO are supporting Sudan Virus Disease (SVD) readiness actions. These include the activation of multi-sectoral coordination mechanisms for SVD; refresher training of rapid response teams; refresher laboratory training; activation/strengthening of community-based surveillance systems for SVD; community engagement and risk communication; reinforcement of points of entry (PoE) and assessment and reinforcement of case management capacities, among other activities.Countries are requested to cascade the operational readiness activities to the sub-national levels in the high-risk districts/states to stop the introduction of SUDV into their communities. A new online readiness assessment tool to measure key performance indicators has been developed to quantify and document the functionality of the readiness capacities in multiple high-risk districts in Uganda and the six countries neighboring Uganda to facilitate real-time monitoring of the actual readiness status.Additionally, readiness shall be assessed jointly by external stakeholders in these six countries. The Joint Assessment Missions (JAM) shall assess readiness at the national level as well as at the high-risk subnational level districts/states. The JAM reports will give a granular picture of readiness capacities across all pillars and throughout all subnational areas at risk.WHO is developing a checklist for community readiness to support early detection and local containment through enhanced community-based surveillance and readiness actions at border areas and communities in neighboring countries.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Uganda has experience in responding to outbreaks of Zaire ebolavirus and Sudan ebolavirus and necessary action has been initiated quickly. The current outbreak is the first outbreak of Sudan ebolavirus in Uganda since 2012. In the absence of licensed vaccines and therapeutics for prevention and treatment of Sudan virus disease, the risk of potential serious public health impact is high.On 21 September 2022, WHO assessed the risk of this event as high at the national level and low at the regional and global levels. The\u00a0WHO\u00a0rapid risk assessment (RRA) will be revised in the coming days based on available and shared information; however, considering the geographical expansion of the SVD outbreak to urban settings,\u00a0currently\u00a0the risk can\u00a0be\u00a0assessed\u00a0to be very high at the national level and high at the regional level and\u00a0remaining\u00a0low at the global level.",
        "WHO Advice": "Successful SVD outbreak control relies on applying a package of interventions, including clinical management, surveillance and contact tracing, a good laboratory service, implementation of IPC measures in health care and community settings, safe and dignified burials and community engagement and social mobilization. Upon identification of a case, early initiation of supportive treatment has been shown to significantly reduce deaths from SVD.WHO advises against any restrictions on travel and/or trade to Uganda based on available information for the current outbreak.",

        "Date Reported": "20 October 2022",
        "Location": "Mauritania",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "Between 30 August and 17 October 2022, a total of 47 confirmed cases of Rift Valley fever (RVF), mostly among animal breeders, including 23 deaths, have been reported from nine of Mauritania\u2019s 15 wilayas (regions). Circulation of the virus that causes RVF in animals (small ruminants, camels and cattle) has been confirmed in eight wilayas of Mauritania. Altogether, 12 wilayas have reported confirmed human or animal cases, including nine that share borders with three neighboring countries\u2014Mali, Senegal and Algeria. A One Health approach is being used to manage the epidemic response.\nThere has been a constant circulation of RVF virus in Mauritania with the country experiencing previous outbreaks in 1987, 2010, 2012, 2015 and 2020. Regional spread of the outbreak cannot be ruled out given the proliferation of the vector in the majority of wilayas, the animal density, and high human population and animal movement to neighboring countries.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 30 August 2022, the Ministry of Health (MoH) of Mauritania notified WHO of an outbreak of Rift Valley fever (RVF) following laboratory confirmation of a case by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at the National Institute for Public Health Research on 29 August. The case was a 25-year-old male who was an animal breeder from Tintane moughataa (also known as district), Hodh El Gharbi wilaya (also known as region). He initially presented to a health center on 25 August with hemorrhagic syndrome (epistaxis) with severe thrombocytopenia and was transferred the following day to a regional hospital, where he died two days later on 29 August.As of 17 October 2022, a total of 47 confirmed cases including 23 deaths (CFR 49%)\u2014mostly among animal breeders\u2014 have been reported from nine of Mauritania\u2019s 15 wilayas (Figure 1, Table 1). Among the 47 confirmed cases, there are more men than women (sex ratio of M:F cases = 4.4:1). The median age of the cases is 22 years, ranging from 3 to 70 years. Among the 23 deaths, nearly all occurred in hospitals and had symptoms that included severe thrombocytopenia and fever associated with the hemorrhagic syndrome (petechiae, hematemesis, gingivorrhagia).Figure 1. Geographical distribution of confirmed human cases of Rift Valley fever (n=47) and deaths (n=23) from nine affected wilayas in Mauritania, 30 August - 17 October 2022. Table 1. Number of confirmed human Rift Valley fever cases and deaths, per the nine affected wilayas, Mauritania, 30 August - 17 October 2022.Figure 2. Confirmed cases (n=47) and deaths (n=23) of Rift Valley fever by confirmation date, Mauritania, 30 August to 17 October 2022. Animal cases of Rift Valley feverWhile human cases of RVF have been reported in nine wilayas as of 17 October 2022, confirmed and suspected animal cases have been reported in 12 wilayas (eight confirmed; four suspected) (Table 2). An alert of potential animal RVF cases resulted from sentinel herd monitoring which notified animal deaths and abortions in Aioun moughataa, Hodh El Gharbi wilaya. The outbreak of RVF in animal populations was subsequently identified in Hodh El Gharbi and additional seven wilayas: Adrar, Assaba, Guidimakha, Hodh Echargui, Tagant, Tiris Zemmour, and Trarza. Between 18 August and 10 October 2022, a total of 1148 samples of animal origin\u2014cattle, camel and small ruminants\u2014were analyzed. Overall positivity was 24.1% (277/1148). Test positivity by animal group: 5.2% (5/96) were positive by ELISA IgM in cattle; 25.8% (113/438) were positive by RT-PCR in camels; 25.9% (159/614) were positive by ELISA IgM in small ruminants.Table 2.\u00a0Number of animals (cattle, camels and small ruminants) tested for RVF and results, by the 12 wilayas with reported cases, Mauritania, 18 August to 10 October 2022.",
        "Epidemiology": "RVF is a viral disease most commonly seen in domesticated animals in sub-Saharan Africa, such as cattle, sheep, goats and camels. RVF primarily affects animals but also has the capacity to infect humans.While some human infections have resulted from the bite of infected mosquitoes, most human infections result from contact with the blood or organs of infected animals. Occupational groups such as herders, farmers, slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians are at higher risk of infection.Humans may also become infected by ingesting the unpasteurized or uncooked milk of infected animals. No human-to-human transmission of RVF has been documented.\u00a0Although RVF often causes severe illness in animals, in humans, the disease ranges from a mild flu-like illness to severe haemorrhagic fever that can be lethal. Most people with RVF have either no symptoms or a mild illness (fever, weakness, back pain, and dizziness). However, a small percentage (8-10%) of people with RVF develop severe symptoms, including eye disease, hemorrhage and encephalitis (swelling of the brain).An outbreak of RVF occurred in Mauritania from September to November 2020, which involved 78 reported human cases and 25 deaths (CFR 32%)[1]. A total of 186 animal cases of RVF were reported: 94 camels, 89 small ruminants and three cattle.",
        "Public Health Response": "A\u00a0One Health approach is being used to manage the epidemic response, including the establishment of a One Health technical committee for a coordinated response at the national level. In the affected wilayas, coordination meetings bringing together the human health and animal health sectors are held weekly.The following priority activities are being implemented: Organization of daily meetings of the One Health technical committee for the management of this epidemic under the coordination of the Ministry of Health. Organization of in-depth epidemiological and entomological investigations.Development of regular situation reports.Sensitization of affected communities, in particular at-risk populations (animal breeders and butchers), on preventive measures and what to do in the event of abortions and deaths within herds, or the occurrence of a haemorrhagic syndrome in a person and active search finding.Supplying drugs and personal protective equipment (PPE) to health facilities in affected areas.Reinforcement of diagnostic and management capacities of health facilities in affected areas.Mobilization of partners for material and financial support resources.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "RVF is not unusual in Mauritania. The country previously experienced outbreaks in 1987, 2010, 2012, 2015 and 2020. Transmission can occur through carrier mosquito bites, contact with contaminated blood or tissues, and during the slaughter of animals. Confirmation of virus circulation in animals from several areas the majority of wilayas presents a significant risk of amplifying the disease in humans.The precarious environmental conditions, inadequate sanitation services in the affected localities, and high animal density contribute to the proliferation of vectors and the spread of the virus. The abundant rainfall recorded this year and flooding in most of these wilayas, combined with the dumping of waste tires, used containers and garbage, enhances the proliferation of vector breeding sites.The risk of spread at the regional level is moderate. Mauritania is an agro-pastoral country, and the movement of animals in search of water and pasture increases the risk of disease spread. Recurrent cross-border pastoral movements increase the risk of regional spread of the disease into neighboring countries. Fourteen of Mauritania\u2019s 15 wilayas have reported either confirmed human, confirmed animal or suspected animal cases[2], of which nine border Mali, Senegal or Algeria; specifically, the wilayas of Assaba, Adrar, Hodh El Chargui, Hodh El Gharbi, Guidimakha and Tiris Zemmour border Mali; the wilayas of Brakna, Gorgal, Guidimakha and Trarza border Senegal, and the wilaya of Tiris Zemmour borders Algeria. Moreover, RVF is not among the diseases subject to vaccination control of cattle at the borders; and transhumance\u2014 a practice characterized by pastoralism and movement of livestock under the care of herders \u2014is frequent within Mauritania and across the borders into Mali and Senegal. Livestock markets in some countries in the sub-region are supplied from Mauritania.The global risk is estimated to be low.",
        "WHO Advice": "Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a zoonosis that mainly affects domestic animals, in particular cattle, sheep, camels and goats. Human cases often occur close to outbreaks in livestock, in an environment conducive for local transmission of the virus by mosquito vectors. Most human infections result from direct or indirect contact with the blood or organs of infected animals. Precautions should be taken when in contact with sick animals or patients, as well as with their products and laboratory samples. No human-to-human transmission of RVF has been documented.\u00a0Public health messaging. Information campaigns on the risk factors for RVF transmission as well as protective measures, such as vector control and protection against mosquito bites, are essential to reducing the number of infections and deaths among people. Public health messages aimed at reducing risk should focus on the following:\u00a0 Reduce the risk of animal-to-human transmission through safer animal husbandry and slaughter practices, including practicing hand hygiene, wearing gloves and other appropriate PPE when handling sick animals or their tissues, or when animals are slaughtered.Reduce the risk of animal-to-human transmission from unsafe consumption of fresh blood, raw milk, or animal tissues. In epizootic regions, all animal products (blood, meat, and milk) must be carefully cooked before being consumed.Implementation of vector control activities (e.g. elimination of larvae in breeding sites), and use of insecticide-treated bed nets and repellents. Wear light-coloured clothing (long-sleeved shirts and pants) and avoid outdoor activities during times when the vector species is most frequently active/biting.Restrict or prohibit the movement of livestock to reduce the spread of the virus from infected to uninfected areas.\u00a0Animal vaccination. When implemented before an outbreak, routine animal vaccination can prevent RVF epizootics. Vaccination campaigns are not recommended during an epizootic because this represents a risk to generate virulent reassortments. As RVF epizootics in animals precede human cases, the establishment of an active animal health surveillance system is essential to provide early warning to veterinary and human public health authorities.\u00a0 Healthcare workers. Although no human-to-human transmission of RVF has been observed, there is a theoretical risk of transmission of the virus to healthcare personnel through contact with contaminated blood or tissue from infected patients. Thus, healthcare workers confronted with suspected or confirmed cases of RVF should apply standard precautions when handling specimens from their patients.\u00a0WHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions to Mauritania or the affected regions, based on information currently available on this event.",

        "Outbreak name": "Cholera",
        "Date Reported": "19 October 2022",
        "Location": "Lebanon",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "This report was revised on 21 October 2022 and the calculated case fatality rate has been deleted as it didn't include all confirmed and probable cases.\nThe Ministry of Public Health of Lebanon notified WHO on 6 October 2022 of two laboratory culture-confirmed cholera cases reported from the northern part of the country. As of 13 October, a total of 18 cases have been confirmed, including two probable deaths. This represents the first cholera outbreak in Lebanon since 1993. Responding to the current cholera outbreak may overwhelm the already fragile health system in the country.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 6 October 2022, the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) of Lebanon, notified WHO of two laboratory-confirmed cholera cases, confirmed by bacteria culture test, reported from North and Akkar governorates, northern Lebanon. The index case, a 51-year-old Syrian man living in an informal settlement in Minieh-Danniyeh district (North governorate), was reported to the MoPH on 5 October 2022. The patient was admitted to the hospital on 1 October with rice water stool and dehydration. Following a possible healthcare-associated transmission, the second case, a 47-year-old health worker, was reported, representing the first nosocomial infection of this outbreak.Immediately following the confirmation of the first two cases, active case finding in the informal settlement where the index case lived, identified 10 additional cases confirmed by bacteria culture test. In addition, Vibrio cholerae was found in potable water sources, irrigation, and sewage. These positive cultures were confirmed on 9 October.In Halba (the capital of Akkar Governorate), an additional two cases were culture-confirmed among Lebanese nationals. On 10 October, an additional four cases were culture-confirmed among Syrian nationals living in an informal settlement in Aarsal town of the Baalbek district.As of 13 October, a total of 18 confirmed cases have been reported. The most affected age group are children under 5 years (44.4%; n=8), followed by persons aged 45 to 64 years (22.2%; n=4), 25-44 years (16.7%; n=3) and 5-15 years (16.7%; n=3). Females are disproportionally affected in the outbreak (72%; n=13). Of the total cases, 11 (61.1%) were reported from the district of Minieh - Danniyeh, four cases (22.2%) from Baalbek district and three cases (16.7%) from Akkar district (Figure 1).In parallel, sewage water testing conducted in Ain Mraisseh in Beirut, Ghadir station in Mount Lebanon, and Bourj Hammoud also in Mount Lebanon, confirmed the presence of V. cholerae in all three sources, indicating that cholera has spread to two other regions of the country (Beirut Area and Mount Lebanon) located far from the initial confirmed cases.Figure 1. Map of confirmed cholera cases by district, Lebanon (n=18), as of 18 October 2022. This is the first outbreak of cholera in Lebanon since the last case was reported in 1993 with no local transmission documented since then.At this stage of the outbreak, laboratory confirmation of cases is done by bacterial culture and MALDI-TOF spectrometry which is conducted at the Department of Experimental Pathology, Immunology, and Microbiology at the American University of Beirut, a WHO collaborating centre.",
        "Epidemiology": "Cholera is an acute enteric infection caused by ingesting the bacteria\u00a0Vibrio cholerae\u00a0present in contaminated water or food. Cholera transmission is closely linked to inadequate access to clean water and poor sanitation facilities or can be linked to the consumption of contaminated food items. \u00a0V. cholerae\u00a0can spread rapidly, depending on the frequency of exposure, the exposed population and the setting. Cholera affects both children and adults, and can be fatal if untreated.The incubation period is between 12 hours and five days after ingestion of contaminated food or water. Due to the short incubation period of cholera, outbreaks can develop rapidly.Most people infected with\u00a0V. cholerae\u00a0do not develop any symptoms, although the bacteria are present in their faeces for 1-10 days after infection and are shed back into the environment, potentially infecting other people. Among people who develop symptoms, the majority have mild or moderate symptoms, while a minority develop acute watery diarrhoea with severe dehydration, which, if left untreated, can lead to death within hours.Cholera is an easily treatable disease. Most people can be treated successfully through prompt administration of oral rehydration solution (ORS).The consequences of a humanitarian crisis \u2013 such as disruption of water and sanitation systems, or the displacement of populations to overcrowded camps with inadequate access to clean water and sanitation \u2013 can increase the risk of cholera transmission, should the bacteria be present or introduced.A multi-sectoral approach including a combination of surveillance, water, sanitation and hygiene, social mobilization, treatment, and oral cholera vaccines is essential to control cholera outbreaks and to reduce deaths.",
        "Public Health Response": "The Ministry of Public Health has established a coordination mechanism with multi-sector partners including the Ministry of Energy and Water, WHO, UNICEF, and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).Response measures implemented, include the following:Intensification of active surveillance and case finding in high-risk camps, informal settlements and hotspot areas, including water quality monitoring (free residual chlorine).Training of trainers for the central and peripheral teams of the surveillance unit was held on 10 and 11 October, and will be followed by training of registered local physicians, hospitals, medical centers and public health centers (PHCs) at central and peripheral levels from 19 to 25 October.Updating of surveillance protocols.Designation of nine referral governmental hospitals to act as cholera treatment centers.Development of a cholera preparedness and response plan, in collaboration with WHO and UNICEF and in agreement with all healthcare partners, that includes the following, but not limited to:Improving capacity for early detection and ensuring proper linkages with WASH response through the support of integrated multisectoral field mission in the Akkar region.Circulars have been issued to hospitals, health centres and health workers regarding the necessity of informing MoPH of any suspected case. Distribution of 1000 Bioline rapid diagnostic tests.Initial stock of medicines required to treat 400 cases was secured.MoPH is exploring a potential request to the International Coordinating Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision for oral cholera vaccine (OCV) doses to cover 400 000 refugees and hosting communities including potential vaccination for prisons.The functionality of water testing laboratories is being assessed in eight hospital laboratories as a first stage to allow for quick, decentralized case identification in various Lebanese regions.A crisis cell was formed to coordinate the provision of clean water, water quality monitoring, and access to adequate sanitation, targeting vulnerable groups living in informal settlements.The associations of doctors and nurses and the Lebanese Society of Bacterial Diseases were contacted to develop training courses for healthcare workers on case management and methods of infection prevention and control, especially within health institutions.Collaboration with relevant ministries, especially energy and water, interior, municipalities, and the environment, to provide safe water and sanitation.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Lebanon\u2019s health system has been hard-hit by a three-year financial crisis and an explosion at the port of Beirut in August 2020 that destroyed essential medical infrastructure in the capital. In this context, responding to a cholera outbreak may overwhelm the already fragile health system in the country.According to The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Lebanon hosts the largest number of refugees in the world per capita and square kilometre, with 1.5 million Syrian refugees and about 13 715 refugees of other nationalities. Additionally, there is a large population of Palestinian refugees that are particularly exposed due to unsafe WASH services in various camps (Beqaa, Trablos, Beirut, Saida, Sour), possibly with limited medical services provided.Due to porous borders allowing free movement between Lebanon and neighbouring countries, the exportation of cholera cases is highly likely.The current cholera outbreak in Lebanon was reported six weeks after a cholera outbreak was declared in neighbouring Syria. On 15 September 2022, WHO assessed the risk of the cholera outbreak in Syria and predicted that due to shortages of drinking water and a fragile and limited health system in Lebanon, there was a risk of a cholera outbreak should the disease be introduced into the country. Power cuts, water shortages, and inflation have strained the already fragile health system in Lebanon. Poverty has also worsened for many Lebanese, with many families frequently rationing water, unable to afford private water tanks for consumption and domestic use.Since the last cholera outbreak in Lebanon occurred in 1993, there is a need to update cholera surveillance and case management guidelines and re-train healthcare workers.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO recommends improving access to proper and timely case management of cholera cases, improving infection, prevention, and control in healthcare facilities, improving access to safe drinking water and sanitation infrastructure, as well as, improving hygiene practices and food safety in affected communities as the most effective means of controlling cholera.Oral cholera vaccine should be used in conjunction with improvements in water and sanitation to control cholera outbreaks and for prevention in targeted areas known to be at high risk for cholera. Key public health communication messages should be provided to the population.Surveillance for early case detection, confirmation and response in other provinces and regions of Lebanon should be reinforced especially at the district level while expanding community-based surveillance.WHO does not recommend any restrictions on international travel or trade to or from Lebanon based on the currently available information.",

        "Outbreak name": "Malaria",
        "Date Reported": "17 October 2022",
        "Location": "Pakistan",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "From January through August 2022, more than 3.4 million suspected cases of malaria were reported in Pakistan compared with the 2.6 million suspected cases reported in 2021. Over 170 000 cases were laboratory confirmed, with the majority reported as Plasmodium vivax. A rapid upsurge in cases was observed in Balochistan and Sindh provinces after the devastating floods in mid-June 2022, together accounting for 78% of all confirmed cases. The risk is assessed as very high considering the current flood crisis affecting the capacity of the national health system.",
        "Description of the Situation": "Malaria is endemic in Pakistan. Between January and August 2022, over 3.4 million suspected cases of malaria were reported in Pakistan compared with the 2.6 million reported over the course of 2021. Over 170 000 cases were laboratory confirmed, of which 77% are due to Plasmodium vivax, and 23% due to Plasmodium falciparum, which is associated with the most severe and fatal cases. Pakistan was hit by devastating floods in June 2022 which resulted in over 33 million people being affected, 81 districts being declared as calamity hit and the health infrastructure being badly impacted. A rapid upsurge in reported malaria cases was observed after the floods. In Sindh province, confirmed malaria cases in August 2022 reached 69 123 compared to 19 826 cases reported in August 2021. In Balochistan province, 41 368 confirmed cases were reported in August 2022 compared to 22 032 confirmed cases in August 2021. These two provinces together account for 78% of all reported confirmed cases in Pakistan in 2022. Reports from 62 high-burden districts indicate that additional 210 715 cases were reported in September 2022, compared to 178 657 cases reported in the same districts in August 2022.",
        "Epidemiology": "Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to people through the bites of infected female\u00a0Anopheles\u00a0mosquitoes. Malaria transmission is also possible through blood transfusion, organ transplantation, or the sharing of needles or syringes contaminated with infected blood. Malaria can also be transmitted from mother to child before or during delivery.There are five parasite species that cause malaria in humans, of which two of these species pose the greatest public health threat, namely\u00a0Plasmodium\u00a0falciparum\u00a0and\u00a0Plasmodium\u00a0vivax.\u00a0Both parasite species are reported in Pakistan, with\u00a0P. vivax\u00a0representing the most predominant parasite (>80%).The first symptoms \u2013 fever, headache and chills \u2013 usually appear within 10\u201315 days after the infective mosquito bite and may be mild and difficult to recognize as malaria. Left untreated, malaria can progress to severe illness and death within a period of 24 hours.",
        "Public Health Response": "The Government of Pakistan is leading the response with support from WHO and other implementing partners. The following actions have been implemented:Health needs assessment was conducted in July 2022 together with other UN agencies.Implementation and strengthening of integrated disease surveillance and response (IDSR) activities in flood-affected districts and utilization of DHIS2 tool for daily reporting of diseases.Mass distribution campaign for long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) was conducted in 13 outbreak and flood-hit districts by the provincial disaster management authority. An additional 600 000 LLINs have been handed over to health authorities in Sindh and Balochistan provinces for distribution to displaced populations in flood-affected districts.Additional teams were deployed to support vector surveillance.WHO provided support through coordination at multiple high-level meetings for health authorities, including enhancing liaison and coordination with provinces and partners, and the constitution of a national task force for emergency response.WHO has mobilized rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and antimalarial medicines to the provinces; about 230 000 RDTs have been provided for malaria and other diseases including acute watery diarrhea, dengue, hepatitis A & E, and chikungunya.WHO is supporting the development of a 6-month contingency plan for submission to the Global Fund.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Malaria is one of the leading causes of illness and death in Pakistan. Intense transmission occurs mainly in districts located in regions bordering the Islamic Republic of Iran and Afghanistan and along the coastal belt in Sindh and Balochistan provinces. In addition, there is high population movement between Pakistan and its border countries (Afghanistan and the Islamic Republic of Iran), particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province with over 1 million Afghani refugees. Of these, nearly 800 000 refugees live in districts officially notified as calamity hit by floods, therefore the risk of international spread of the disease cannot be ruled out.Over 33 million people have been affected by the floods and 81 districts have been declared as calamity hit. The health infrastructure was also damaged with rapid assessments indicating some 1543 health facilities and their contents have been damaged.Given the current situation in Pakistan and limited access to health facilities and insufficient healthcare workers and essential medical supplies, there is an increased risk of serious health impacts from malaria and other ongoing outbreaks including COVID-19, acute watery diarrhoea, typhoid, measles, leishmaniasis, HIV, and polio. The risk is assessed as very high considering the current flood crisis affecting the capacity of the national health system. Many challenges to response measures surfaced when some flood-affected districts reported a doubling in incidence rates, a high P. falciparum ratio, and limited stocks of emergency medicines, insecticides and supplies accompanied with a long lead time for procurement. The lack of resources to adequately scale-up precautionary vector-control measures will certainly increase the spread of malaria and other vector-borne diseases.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO recommends malaria prevention tools and strategies including effective vector control and the use of preventive antimalarial drugs to reduce the global burden of the disease. Also, strengthening malaria surveillance is important to identify high-risk areas or populations prone to infection, enable the monitoring of changing disease patterns, and assist in designing effective public health interventions. Continued delivery of key public health messages on reducing the risk of malaria transmission among the population represents another important tool for malaria prevention and control.Early diagnosis and treatment of malaria reduce disease severity, prevent deaths, and contribute to reducing onward malaria transmission. WHO recommends that all suspected cases of malaria be confirmed using parasite-based diagnostic testing (through either microscopy or a rapid diagnostic test). Diagnostic testing enables health providers to swiftly distinguish between malarial and non-malarial fevers, facilitating appropriate treatment.At this stage, case management of malaria represents a critical priority to respond to the malaria situation in Pakistan, including the availability of medicines and RDTs. Preventative measures to reduce malaria transmission also include the use of LLINs and indoor residual spraying (IRS). Vector control is a vital component of malaria control and elimination strategies as it is highly effective in preventing infection and reducing disease transmission. However, there is a limited number of LLINs available, and the distributed ones are not enough; also, the usage of LLIN by flood-affected people is not high. Additionally, available resources for IRS are extremely limited at this stage.Since October 2021, WHO also recommends the broad use of the RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine among children living in regions with moderate to high P. falciparum malaria transmission. The vaccine has been shown to significantly reduce malaria, and deadly severe malaria infection, among young children.WHO does not recommend any general travel or trade restrictions to Pakistan based on the information available for this event.",

        "Location": "Pakistan",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "Between 1 January and 27 September 2022, a total of 25 932 confirmed dengue cases and 62 deaths (CFR 0.25%) were reported in Pakistan, with 74% of these cases reported in the month of September alone. The current surge in cases follows unprecedented flooding that began in mid-June 2022. With the current flood crisis affecting the national health system capacity and the growing humanitarian situation, there is a high risk of serious health impacts from dengue fever and other concurrent disease outbreaks. High population movement between Pakistan and bordering countries (in particular, Afghanistan and the Islamic Republic of Iran) means that the international transmission of dengue fever cannot be ruled out.",
        "Description of the Situation": "Dengue fever is endemic to Pakistan, which experiences year-round transmission with seasonal peaks. However, triggered by the worst flooding in the country\u2019s history that began in mid-June, the number of reported dengue cases is significantly\nhigher in 2022 (between January and September) as compared to the same period during the four previous years.Between 1 January to 27 September\u00a02022, according to the National Institute of Health-Islamabad, a cumulative total of 25 932 confirmed dengue cases and 62 deaths have been reported nationally. Three-quarters (74%) of these cases were reported\nduring the month of September alone. As of 22 September, the distribution of cases by province was available for 83% (n=21 777) of the total cases, of which 32% (n=6888) were reported from Sindh, 29% (n=6255) from Punjab (including the Islamabad\nCapital Territory), 25% (n=5506) from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and 14% (n=3128) from Balochistan (Figure 1).Figure 1. Distribution of confirmed dengue cases in Pakistan by province, 1 January to 22 September 2022.",
        "Epidemiology": "Dengue is a viral infection transmitted by mosquitoes caused by four types of dengue virus (DENV 1, DENV 2, DENV 3, DENV 4).\u00a0Infection with one serotype provides long-term immunity to the homologous serotype, but not to other serotypes; sequential infections put people at greater risk of severe dengue. DENV can cause an acute flu-like illness, many DENV infections produce only mild illness; over 80% of cases are asymptomatic.There is no specific treatment for dengue, however, timely detection of cases, identifying any warning signs of severe dengue infection, and appropriate case management are key elements of care to prevent patient death and can lower fatality rates of severe infection to below 1%.Dengue fever is endemic\u00a0in Pakistan, with seasonal outbreaks and the circulation of the four serotypes in different areas of the country.\u00a0Aedes aegypti\u00a0and\u00a0Aedes albopictus\u00a0are widely adapted vectors for urban and\u00a0peri-urban\u00a0environments.\u00a0As dengue is recurrent in the country, the population may be at risk of re-infection and therefore,\u00a0serious complications may occur if not managed promptly and correctly.",
        "Public Health Response": "The Ministry of Health, in collaboration with the Global Fund, is conducting vector surveillance and control activities as a part of Integrated Vector Management, including:Technical weekly committee meetings chaired by the Ministry of Health.Activation of \u2018dengue counters\u2019 in all health facilities; designated areas in emergency departments allocated for receiving suspected dengue cases. Enhancement of vector surveillance activities in Lahore and other districts.Provision of additional teams to support vector surveillance activities including the daily situation analysis.The WHO is providing support including:Coordination at multiple high-level meetings for health authorities including visits and meetings of the WHO representative. Strengthening of\u00a0laboratory\u00a0and hospital-based disease surveillance across all provinces in the country has been initiated. Training of selected\u00a0health\u00a0care providers from all provinces in the country is being held on case management of\u00a0dengue fever. Training on vector surveillance and vector control\u00a0including source reduction during house visits is underway.Provision of 230 000 rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for dengue and other diseases, including malaria, acute watery diarrhoea, chikungunya, hepatitis A and E.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Pakistan is experiencing an abnormal monsoon rainfall and unprecedented floods. One-third of the country and an estimated 33 million people have been impacted in 84 calamity declared districts. More than 2 million houses have been destroyed and an estimated 1460 health facilities have also reportedly been damaged. Some 7.9 million people are reportedly displaced, 12 900 people injured, and 1600 people have died. Heavy rains and floods have left millions of people without access to healthcare and medical treatment.With the current flood crisis affecting the national health system capacity, there is a high risk of serious health impacts from dengue fever.\u00a0 Currently, there is a need for improved vector surveillance, enhanced laboratory capacity for better detection, sensitization of health care providers on case management (including warning signs of severe dengue) and improved surveillance of acute febrile illness to better define disease burden and seasonality patterns. Vector-borne epidemics \u2013 including dengue \u2013 after flooding is a well-known phenomenon, as the stagnant water provides favorable habitats for mosquitoes to breed. The lag time is usually around 3-4 weeks before the occurrence of dengue cases.Ongoing disease outbreaks in Pakistan, including acute watery diarrhoea, dengue, malaria, measles, polio, and COVID-19 are being further aggravated, particularly in internally displaced persons and refugee camps and where water and sanitation facilities have been damaged.Dengue fever is the most rapidly spreading mosquito-borne virus infection in the world. There is high population movement between Pakistan\u2014in particular, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province\u2014 and bordering countries, especially the Islamic Republic of Iran and Afghanistan. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province is also home to 1 200 000 Afghani refugees, of which 800 000 live in districts officially notified as calamity hit by floods. The transmission of dengue fever from Pakistan to border countries cannot be ruled out.",
        "WHO Advice": "The proximity of mosquito vector breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for dengue virus infection.\u00a0There is no specific treatment for dengue infection, but early detection and access to appropriate healthcare reduce mortality.\u00a0Furthermore, the prevention and control of dengue depend on effective vector surveillance and control.\u00a0WHO promotes the strategic approach known as Integrated Vector Management (IVM) to control mosquito activity and population, including\u00a0Aedes\u00a0spp.\u00a0(the vector of dengue).\u00a0IVM activities should be enhanced to remove potential breeding sites, reduce vector populations, and minimize individual exposure.\u00a0This should involve vector control strategies for larvae and adults (i.e.\u00a0environmental management and source reduction, and chemical control measures), as well as strategies for protecting people and households.\u00a0Vector control activities should focus on all areas where there is human-vector contact (place of residence, workplaces, schools and hospitals).\u00a0Vector control activities can include covering, draining and cleaning household water storage containers on a weekly basis.\u00a0In addition, this may include chlorination of drinking water and application of suitable larvicides/insecticides for water storage in outdoor containers.\u00a0Where indoor biting occurs,\u00a0application of mosquito repellent lotion or sprays on the skin, use of\u00a0household insecticide aerosol products, mosquito coils, or other insecticide vaporizers\u00a0are recommended. Household fixtures such as window and door screens and air conditioning can also reduce bites. Since\u00a0Aedes\u00a0spp mosquitoes (the primary vector for transmission) are\u00a0day biters with peak activity at dawn and dusk, personal protective measures such as\u00a0the\u00a0use of clothing\u00a0to minimize\u00a0skin exposure\u00a0are\u00a0recommended.\u00a0During outdoor activities, mosquito repellents may be applied to exposed skin or to clothing.\u00a0Insecticide-treated nets offer good protection to people who sleep outside or during the day (e.g.\u00a0infants, people confined to bed, and night\u00a0workers) and at night to prevent mosquito bites.\u00a0In addition, vector and human case surveillance should continue to be enhanced in all affected areas and across the country.\u00a0Key public health messages on reducing the risk of dengue transmission among the population are expected to continue to be provided.\u00a0WHO does not recommend any general travel or trade restrictions\u00a0to\u00a0Pakistan based on the information available for this\u00a0event.",

        "Outbreak name": "Cholera",
        "Date Reported": "12 October 2022",
        "Location": "Haiti",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "After more than 3 years with no reported cases of cholera in Haiti, on 2 October 2022, the national authorities reported two confirmed cases of Vibrio cholerae O1 in the greater Port-au-Prince area.\nThe current cholera outbreak is taking place in Port-au-Prince and Cit\u00e9 Soleil. These are areas that are experiencing civil unrest with several thousand people having been displaced as a result of the increase in violence.",
        "Description of the Situation": "Between 25 September and 8 October 2022, the Haiti Ministry of Public Health and Population (MSPP per its acronym in French) reported 32 laboratory-confirmed cases of Vibrio cholerae (including two identified as serogroup O1), and 224 suspected cases from Port-au-Prince and Cit\u00e9 Soleil. A total of 189 cases have been hospitalized, of which 16 deaths have been reported. Of the total reported cases, 55% are males and 49% are aged 19 years or younger. The most affected age group is 1 to 4-year-olds (Figure 3).The first cholera outbreak was reported in Haiti in October 2010. Nationally, a total of 820 000 cases of cholera including 9792 deaths were reported between October 2010 and February 2019 (Figure 4). The last confirmed case of cholera was reported in January 2019 in I\u2019Est\u00e8re in the Artibonite department of Haiti. The country did not report a single confirmed case of cholera in the three years from January 2019 to January 2022.",
        "Epidemiology": "Cholera is an acute enteric infection caused by ingesting the bacteria\u00a0Vibrio cholerae\u00a0present in contaminated water or food. It is mainly linked to inadequate sanitation and insufficient access to safe drinking water. It is an extremely virulent disease that can cause severe acute watery diarrhoea resulting in high morbidity and mortality, and can spread rapidly, depending on the frequency of exposure, the exposed population and the setting. Cholera affects both children and adults and can be fatal if untreated.The incubation period is between 12 hours and five days after ingestion of contaminated food or water. Most people infected with\u00a0V. cholerae\u00a0do not develop any symptoms, although the bacteria are present in their faeces for 1-10 days after infection and are shed back into the environment, potentially infecting other people. Among people who develop symptoms, the majority have mild or moderate symptoms, while a minority develop acute watery diarrhoea with severe dehydration. Cholera is an easily treatable disease. Most people can be treated successfully through prompt administration of oral rehydration solution (ORS).The consequences of a humanitarian crisis \u2013 such as disruption of water and sanitation systems, or the displacement of populations to inadequate and overcrowded camps \u2013 can increase the risk of cholera transmission, should the bacteria be present or introduced.A multisectoral approach including a combination of surveillance, water, sanitation and hygiene, social mobilization, treatment, and oral cholera vaccines is essential to control cholera outbreaks and to reduce deaths.",
        "Public Health Response": "Emergency response activities are being conducted by the Ministry of Health, WHO and other partners as below.The Incident Management Support Team (IMST) has been activated for outbreak response activitiesRegular epidemiological alerts are being published by WHO for enhanced information sharing and wider community awareness about the current epidemiological situation.Updated information on the event has been provided to the other Member States through the International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Points (NFPs) network.Support has been provided to Haiti health authorities for control and response actions as well as resources such as cholera kits.Event-based surveillance has been strengthened to monitor official and unofficial reports for information regarding the local situation. The multisectoral response plan has been developed with a focus on case management, water, hygiene and sanitation (WASH), vaccination, communication and psychosocial support, strengthening preparedness in unaffected departments, and advocating to improve security conditions to facilitate the response.WHO is working in coordination with the public health authorities to characterize this event and support the response.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "The current cholera outbreak in Haiti, combined with the ongoing crisis related to gang violence, social unrest, and insecurity, has strained the health system\u2019s response capacity. In addition, the country is highly vulnerable and at risk of natural hazards, which have exacerbated previous humanitarian crises.The overall risk assessed for this outbreak is very high at the national level, due to the following reasons:The current socio-economic situation, ongoing humanitarian crisis and poor health conditions are affecting a large proportion of the population leaving them vulnerable to the risk of cholera infection and recurrence of cholera. \u00a0In the affected areas of Port-au-Prince metropolitan area and southern departments, there are 24 200 internally displaced people\u00a0who have been displaced due to gang violence.Limited access of the general population to safe drinking water and to sanitation facilities.Due to the insecurity, the public health system and international partners have limited human resources in Haiti, reducing the capacity to respond.Logistics issues and lack of access to fuel and insecurity lead to difficulties to import supplies and challenges to access the affected areas. Therefore, timely assessment of the epidemiological situation is complex. Additionally, for the same reasons the shipment of biological samples from healthcare facilities to reference laboratories could also be hampered.The risk at the regional level is assessed as moderate, due to the following reasons:Since 2010, confirmed cases of cholera have predominantly been reported from Haiti, followed by the Dominican Republic, Cuba, and Mexico. Sporadic imported cases have also been reported in other countries in the Region. However, there is greater capacity in other countries to detect and control outbreaks of cholera. Neighboring Dominican Republic which is likely the most at risk of an increase in cases, has the capacity to detect and control cholera.The risk at the global level was assessed as low.WHO will continue to evaluate the epidemiological situation in Haiti.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO recommends improving access to proper and timely case management of cholera cases, improving access to safe drinking water and sanitation infrastructure, as well as improving infection, prevention, and control in healthcare facilities. These measures along with the promotion of preventive hygiene practices and food safety in affected communities are the most effective means of controlling cholera. Targeted public health communication messages are a key element for a successful campaign.Oral cholera vaccine (OCV) should be used in conjunction with improvements in water and sanitation to control cholera outbreaks and for prevention in targeted areas known to be at high risk for cholera. Given the re-emergence of cholera in Haiti, WHO recommends that Member States strengthen and maintain surveillance for cholera for the early detection of suspected cases and to provide adequate treatment and prevent its spread. Early and adequate treatment limits the case fatality ratio (CFR) of hospitalized patients to less than 1%.WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions on Haiti based on the currently available information.",

        "Outbreak name": "Dengue",
        "Date Reported": "10 October 2022",
        "Location": "Nepal",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "Dengue is endemic in Nepal. The country is experiencing a surge in cases that started from the week commencing 8 August to 26 August. Between January to 28 September 2022, a total of 28 109 confirmed and suspected dengue cases and 38 confirmed deaths due to dengue have been recorded, affecting all seven provinces. The causative serotype(s) is unknown. This represents the largest dengue outbreak in Nepal with regard to the cumulative number of cases reported nationwide per year.",
        "Description of the Situation": "Between January and 28 September 2022, a total of 28 109 suspected and confirmed cases of dengue fever including 38 confirmed deaths (overall CFR 0.13%) have been reported from all seven provinces of Nepal, affecting all 77 districts in Nepal (Figure 1). Bagmati province which is the second-most populous province has reported the highest number of cases (78.2%) and deaths (68.4%).According to the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division (EDCD) of the Ministry of Health and Population, the highest number of new cases in 2022 have been reported in the districts of Kathmandu (n=9528; 33.8%), Lalitpur (n=6548; 23.2%), and Makwanpur (n=2776, 9.8%).Data on demographics was available for 23% of cases (n= 6734) of which 76% (5175/6734) were aged 15-59 years old, and 54% were males (n=3637). As of 28 September, 38 deaths have been verified, of which males and cases aged 15 \u2013 59 years old each accounted for 55% (n=21) of reported deaths. Cases aged over 60 years old accounted for 39% (n=15) of reported deaths.Dengue cases have increased since July coinciding with the rainy season with majority of the cases reported during September (83.6%; n=23 514).Figure 1. \u00a0Number of Dengue cases reported from districts of Nepal from 1 January- 28 September 2022. Figure 2. \u00a0\u00a0Number of dengue cases reported by months in Nepal from 1 January to 28 September 2022",
        "Epidemiology": "Dengue is a viral infection transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes and is found in tropical and sub-tropical climates worldwide, mostly in urban and semi-urban areas. The primary vectors that transmit the disease are\u00a0Aedes aegypti\u00a0mosquitoes and, to a lesser extent,\u00a0Aedes albopictus.Dengue virus (DENV) has four serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4) and it is possible to be infected by each. Infection with one serotype provides long-term immunity to the homologous serotype but not to the other serotypes; sequential infections put people at greater risk for severe dengue. Many DENV infections produce only mild illness; over 80% of cases are asymptomatic. DENV can cause an acute flu-like illness.There is no specific treatment for dengue; however, timely detection of cases, identifying any warning signs of severe dengue infection, and appropriate case management are key elements of care to prevent patient death and can lower fatality rates of severe infection to below 1%.",
        "Public Health Response": "The Epidemiology and Diseases Control Division of the Ministry of Health and Population initiated the following actions to manage and coordinate the response:Overall response: The Ministry of Health and Population (MoHP) together with WHO and hospitals convened a meeting to review the preparedness and map out strategic interventions for the dengue outbreak in the country. Virtual meetings have been conducted with provinces, districts, and local levels of the MoHP to review the current epidemiology and the responses required. WHO drafted the multisectoral engagement plan to accelerate the Dengue Response and submitted it to the EDCD for review and implementation of action plans.Vector Control measures: WHO assisted in the development of a standard operating procedure for vector control activities. Technical working group meetings have been convened to facilitate dengue response and to strengthen vector surveillance activities in high-risk/high-case reporting districts in Kathmandu valley (which is in Bagmati province) and Lumbini province). Search and destroy campaigns for mosquitoes in municipalities including Lalitpur and Kathmandu (prioritizing main breeding containers) have been initiated. Vector surveillance and sample collection in high-case reporting districts in Kathmandu have been initiated. Laboratory: A total of 39 000 diagnostic kits have been provided through WHO and Government funding. \u00a0WHO facilitated sample collection for serotyping from ten identified hospitals nation wise in collaboration with EDCD and National Public Health Laboratory (NPHL).Clinical Management: A total of 200 physicians and medical officers were trained in September, in the case management of dengue fever, referral of dengue patients, and reporting for the dengue surveillance system. \u00a0This included in-person attendance of 70 healthcare workers (HCWs) from major hospitals in Kathmandu Valley and an additional 130 HCWs from all Provinces who joined virtually. The video recording of the orientation has been disseminated by EDCD for its wider use.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Nepal reported its first dengue case in a traveller returning from India in 2004. Since then, dengue has been endemic in Nepal. The country has expertise and experience in managing dengue, however, WHO considers the overall risk for the current dengue outbreak high at the national level due to the following reasons: As dengue is recurrent in the country, the population may be at risk of re-infection and therefore,\u00a0serious complications may occur if not managed promptly and correctly.\u00a0 At present, severe dengue cases and case-fatality rates appear to be increasing, likely due to the limited hospital capacity in-country and limited access to and use of health care services. With the current increase in other vector-borne diseases in Nepal this year, such as Japanese Encephalitis and Scrub typhus, affecting\u00a0the national health system capacity, there is a high risk of serious health impacts from dengue fever. Dengue virus has the potential to cause epidemics resulting in high morbidity and mortality.\u00a0 There is no specific treatment. Early recognition of dengue virus infection and appropriate clinical management can reduce the severity of disease and mortality among dengue patients.The current circulating serotype is unknown at this stage, although further laboratory tests are planned. Infection with one serotype provides long-term immunity to the homologous serotype, however, the risk for severe dengue is high in a second infection with a different DENV serotype.Current data suggests that dengue cases are increasing in magnitude and expanding out of the lowland areas typically suitable for the breeding of Aedes mosquitoes to higher elevations, potentially due to climate changes and rapid urbanization.This outbreak underscores the need for improved vector surveillance, enhanced laboratory capacity for better case detection, and improved\u00a0surveillance of acute febrile illness in Nepal to effectively control the outbreak.\u00a0There is frequent population movement across the Nepal-India land border. Dengue is endemic in many parts of India including northern Indian States, which share the border with Nepal.\u00a0 Given the high incidence in Nepal, it is possible that dengue may spread across the border into India, although its consequences may depend on a number of factors such as the density of vectors, circulating serotypes, and level of public health response in the neighbouring Indian states. Nepal is a popular tourist destination, hence, spread through international travellers cannot be ruled out as Nepal is easing international travel restrictions imposed in response to COVID-19.",
        "WHO Advice": "The proximity of mosquito vector breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for dengue virus infection.\u00a0 Although dengue does not spread from human to human, mosquitoes can become infected after biting infected individuals. This cycle, therefore, makes the infected mosquito capable of spreading the dengue virus among households and in the neighbourhood, leading to clusters of cases.The prevention and control of dengue depend on effective vector control. WHO promotes a strategic approach known as Integrated Vector Management (IVM) to control mosquito vectors, including Aedes subspecies (the vector of dengue). IVM should be enhanced to remove potential breeding sites, reduce vector populations, and minimize individual exposure. This should involve vector control strategies for larvae and adults (i.e., environmental management and source reduction, and chemical control measures), as well as strategies for protecting people and households. Vector control activities should focus on all areas where there is a risk of human-vector contact (place of residence, workplaces, schools and hospitals, and construction sites in Kathmandu Valley). Vector control activities can include covering, draining, and cleaning household water storage containers on a weekly basis. Space spraying with insecticide can be deployed as an emergency measure. Chlorination and application of suitable larvicides/insecticides for water storage in outdoor containers should also be considered.Personal protective measures during outdoor activities include the application of repellents to exposed skin or clothing, and the wearing of long sleeves shirts and trousers. Indoors, additionally, protection can include the use of household insecticide aerosol products or mosquito coils. Window and door screens, as well as air conditioning, can reduce the probability of mosquitoes entering the house. Insecticide-treated nets offer good protection to people against mosquito bites while sleeping during the day. Since Aedes mosquitoes are active at dawn and dusk, personal protective measures are recommended particularly at these times of the day.There is no specific treatment for dengue infection, but early detection of warning signs and timely access to appropriate clinical management (including referral to an appropriate health care facility) reduce the risk for severe dengue complications and mortality. Vector and human case surveillance should continue to be enhanced in all affected areas and across the country. Where feasible, resources should be allocated for the strengthening of a sample referral mechanism for the confirmation and sub-typing of dengue virus.WHO does not recommend that any general travel or trade restrictions be applied to Nepal based on the information available for this event.",

        "Date Reported": "29 September 2022",
        "Location": "Democratic Republic of the Congo",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 27 September 2022, the Ministry of Health (MoH) of the Democratic Republic of the Congo declared the end of the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak that affected Butanuka health area, Beni health zone, North Kivu province. In accordance with WHO recommendations, the declaration was made 42 days (twice the maximum incubation period for Ebola virus infections) after the burial of the last and only confirmed case.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 21 August 2022, the MoH of the Democratic Republic of the Congo declared an Ebola outbreak following laboratory confirmation via reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of Ebola virus in a fatal case in Beni health zone, North Kivu province.The case was a 46-year-old woman hospitalized and treated from 23 July to 15 August (23 days) for symptoms that included cough, headache, polyarthralgia (joint pain), and physical asthenia (general fatigue), thought to be related to her known co-morbidities. The patient died in hospital on 15 August 2022. The body was returned to the family and buried in a traditional manner on 16 August prior to receipt of the laboratory results.Samples of blood and oropharyngeal secretions tested positive for Zaire ebolavirus by RT-PCR at the National Institute for Biomedical Research in Beni (INRB) on 15 August and these were confirmed at Rodolphe M\u00e9rieux INRB Laboratory in Goma on 16 August. The outbreak was declared by the MoH following EVD confirmation testing and genetic sequencing.No additional confirmed or probable cases have been identified since 16 August. Of the 182 contacts of the case, 172 were identified and monitored for 21 days. The 10 contacts who were not followed up were unable to be reached.Investigations are still ongoing to determine the source of the outbreak.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "Overall response:\u00a0The MoH, together with WHO and other partners, conducted response measures to control the outbreak and prevent further spread. National and district emergency management committees were activated to coordinate the response. Multidisciplinary teams were deployed to actively search and provide care for cases; identify, reach and follow-up contacts; and sensitize communities on outbreak prevention and control interventions.Alerts and testing: During this outbreak, from 21 August to 27 September 2022, a total of 9173 alerts were reported from Beni health zone, and all (100%) were investigated, including 607 (7%) validated as suspected cases of EVD. A total of 682 samples were tested for EVD.Points of entry: A total of 2390 (92%) of 2608 travelers registered at points of entry were screened for EVD, and no alerts were detected.Vaccination: As of 27 September, 550 persons in the affected health zone have been vaccinated against EVD using the ring strategy, targeting contacts and contacts of contact. Frontline health care workers made up the majority of those vaccinated (483).",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "This latest EVD outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is declared over, with no new cases reported for 42 days after the burial of the last and only confirmed case on 16 August 2022. This case is genetically linked to the 2018-2020 outbreak in North Kivu, Ituri and South Kivu provinces. (For more information on this outbreak, please see the WHO outbreak account related to the 2018-2020 event). The source of this most recent outbreak has not yet been identified.A future outbreak is not unexpected given that EVD is endemic in the country. Ebola virus is enzootic and a resurgence from viral persistence in survivors described in recent epidemics. Re-emergence of EVD is a major public health concern in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; gaps remain in the country's capacity to recover, prepare for, and respond to outbreaks. The concurrent outbreaks in the country (COVID-19, cholera, measles, polio, yellow fever, monkeypox, etc) as well as the protracted humanitarian situation in the Eastern part of the country have put increasing pressure on the health system and the available resources.A confluence of environmental and socioeconomic factors \u2014 including community mistrust, weak health systems, and political instability \u2014 in some specific areas such as North Kivu province can increase the risk for new outbreaks of EVD. Moreover, improved capacities in detection, laboratory confirmation and increased surveillance may explain the increased frequency in detecting EVD outbreaks. Nevertheless, WHO is concerned that ongoing challenges regarding insecurity as well as health system challenges (epidemiological surveillance, IPC programmes and practices in health care settings), coupled with the emergence of COVID-19 and other ongoing outbreaks, may jeopardize the country's ability to rapidly detect and respond to any re-emergence.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO advises the following risk reduction measures as an effective way to reduce EVD transmission in humans:Reduce the risk of wildlife-to-human transmission from contact with infected fruit bats or non-human primates and the consumption of their raw meat. Animals should be handled with gloves and other appropriate protective clothing.Reduce the risk of human-to-human transmission from direct or close contact with people with Ebola symptoms, particularly with their bodily fluids. Appropriate personal protective equipment should be worn when taking care of ill patients. Regular hand washing is required after visiting patients in hospital, as well as after touching or coming into contact with any body fluids.Continue training and retraining of health personnel for early detection, isolation and treatment of EVD cases as well as retraining on safe and dignified burials.Reduce the risk of possible transmission from virus persistence in some body fluids of survivors. WHO recommends providing medical care, psychological support and biological testing (until two consecutive negative tests) through an EVD survivors care programme. WHO does not recommend isolation of male or female convalescent patients whose blood has been tested negative for the Ebola virus.Reduce amplification of transmission through health care by strengthening IPC programmes within the health care system.Provide ongoing training of the health workforce for early detection, isolation, and treatment of EVD cases as well as re-training on safe and dignified burials and the IPC ring approach.Engage with communities to reinforce safe and dignified burial practices.Build and maintain capacities for logistic support in at-risk areas or countries.Based on the\u00a0current risk assessment and prior evidence on Ebola outbreaks, WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.",

In accordance with WHO recommendations the declaration was made 42 days (twice the maximum incubation period for Marburg infection) after the second negative test of the last confirmed case on 5 August 2022.",
        "Description of the Situation": "Between 28 June and 16 September 2022, the Ministry of Health of Ghana reported three confirmed cases of Marburg Virus Disease (MVD) including two deaths (CFR 67%). All three cases were from the same household.The Ministry of Health of Ghana declared the outbreak on 7 July 2022, after confirmation of Marburg virus on 1 July 2022 in a 26-year-old male (the index case) by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research (NMIMR). Blood samples were sent to Institute Pasteur, Dakar for confirmation. The onset of his symptoms was the 22 June with subsequent bleeding from the nose and mouth. The patient was admitted to a hospital on 26 June 2022 and died the following day.The second patient, a 14-month-old child, developed symptoms and was admitted on 17 July; he died on the third day of admission. The third patient, a 24-year-old female was admitted to a government-designated isolation center on 26 July 2022. \u00a0\u00a0A total of 198 contacts were identified, monitored, and completed their recommended initial 21-day observation period which was then extended for another 21 days by the health authorities.On 16 September 2022, the MoH declared the end of the outbreak, 42 days (twice the maximum incubation period) after the second negative test of the last confirmed case on 5 August 2022.",
        "Epidemiology": "Marburg Virus Disease (MVD) is an epidemic-prone disease associated with high case fatality ratios (CFR; 24-88%). In the early course of the disease, the clinical diagnosis of MVD is difficult to distinguish from many other tropical febrile illnesses due to the similarities in the clinical symptoms. Other VHFs need to be excluded, including Ebola virus disease, as well as malaria, typhoid fever, leptospirosis, rickettsial infections, and plague. Human MVD infection can result from prolonged exposure to mines or caves inhabited by Rousettus bat colonies. Marburg virus spreads through human-to-human transmission via direct contact (through broken skin or mucous membranes) with infected people's blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids, and surfaces and materials (e.g. bedding, clothing) contaminated with these fluids.Although no vaccines or antiviral treatments are approved to treat the virus, supportive care \u2013 rehydration with oral or intravenous fluids \u2013 and treatment of specific symptoms improve survival. A range of potential treatments are being evaluated, including blood products, immune therapies, and drug therapies.In 2021,\u00a0an outbreak of MVD was reported for the first time in West Africa in Guinea. Genetic sequencing results indicated that the Marburg virus (MARV) genomes from Ghana are related to the sequence from the 2021 outbreak and overall, group with sequences obtained from bats in Sierra Leone and an outbreak that occurred in Angola in 2004-2005.",
        "Public Health Response": "Overall Response: The MoH established a national coordination mechanism and response activities were initiated by WHO and other key partners, US Center for Disease Control, UNICEF and United Kingdom, Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO). Technical experts were deployed by WHO to support the country in strengthening Infection Prevention and Control (IPC), coordination, surveillance, and to conduct investigations and risk assessment.Surveillance and Contract Tracing: An integrated disease surveillance and response (IDSR) system was in place and reported alerts were tested. Surveillance activities were implemented including epidemiological investigation and 198 contacts were followed up.Infection Prevention and Control: Health care workers were sensitized on case definition and infection prevention.Laboratory: Samples of all suspected cases were tested at the laboratory of NMIMR. Genomic sequencing was performed on samples from two of the confirmed cases at NMIMR and IPD.Community Engagement: Orientation was held for community-based surveillance volunteers to enhance surveillance in the community.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "The current outbreak of MVD in Ghana has been declared over, with no new cases reported for 42-days after the second negative test of the last confirmed case on 5 August 2022. This was the first MVD outbreak reported in Ghana. Outbreaks of MVD are not frequent in West Africa. The most recent MVD outbreak was reported in the Republic of Guinea (one confirmed case) in August 2021. Countries in the African Region that have previously reported outbreaks of MVD include Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, South Africa, and Uganda. \u00a0The epidemiological investigation has not yet identified the source of this outbreak, which highlights the need to intensify community-based surveillance.\u00a0The risk of this outbreak at its onset was assessed high at the national level, moderate at the regional level, and low at the global level.",
        "WHO Advice": "Human-to-human transmission of Marburg virus is primarily associated with direct contact with blood and/or bodily fluids of infected persons, and health care related transmission of Marburg virus has been reported when appropriate infection control measures have not been implemented.Infection Prevention and Control at Health Care Facilities: Health care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed Marburg virus disease should apply standard and transmission-based IPC precautions to avoid any exposure to blood and/or bodily fluids, as well as unprotected contact with the possibly contaminated environment. IPC precautions include:Early recognition (screening, triage) and isolation of suspected cases.Appropriate isolation capacity (including infrastructure and human resources).Health care workers\u2019 access to hand hygiene resources (i.e., soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub).Appropriate and accessible PPE for health care workers.Safe injection practices (emphasize on single-use only needles).Procedures and resources for decontamination and sterilization of medical devices.Appropriate management of infectious waste.Integrated disease surveillance and response activities, including community-based surveillance, must continue to be strengthened within all affected health zones.Community Awareness for Infection prevention and control: Raising awareness of the risk factors for Marburg virus disease and the protective measures individuals can take to reduce human exposure to the virus are the key measures to reduce human infections and deaths. Key public health communication messages include:Reducing the risk of human-to-human transmission in the community arising from direct contact with infected patients, particularly with their bodily fluids.Avoiding close physical contact with patients who have Marburg virus disease.Any suspected case should not be managed at home, but immediately transferred to a health facility for treatment and isolation. During this transfer, health care workers should wear appropriate PPE.Regular hand washing should be performed after visiting sick relatives in hospital.Communities affected by Marburg should make efforts to ensure that the population is well informed, both about the nature of the disease itself to avoid further transmission, community stigmatization, and encourage early presentation to treatment centers and other necessary outbreak containment measures, including safe burial of the dead. People who have died from Marburg should be promptly and safely buried.Reduce the risk of wildlife-to-human transmissions, such as through contact with fruit bats, monkeys, and apes:Handle wildlife with gloves and other appropriate protective clothing.Cook animal products such as blood and meat thoroughly before consumption and avoid consumption of raw meat.During work, research activities or tourist visits in mines or caves inhabited by fruit bat colonies, people should wear gloves and other appropriate protective clothing including masks.",

        "Date Reported": "26 September 2022",
        "Location": "Uganda",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 20 September 2022, Uganda health authorities declared an outbreak of Ebola disease, caused by Sudan virus, following laboratory confirmation of a patient from a village in Madudu sub-county, Mubende district, central Uganda.\nAs of 25 September 2022, a cumulative number of 18 confirmed and 18 probable cases have been reported from Mubende, Kyegegwa and Kassanda districts, including 23 deaths, of which five were among confirmed cases (CFR among confirmed cases 28%). This is the first Ebola disease outbreak caused by Sudan virus (SUDV) in Uganda since 2012.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 20 September 2022, the health authorities in Uganda declared an outbreak of Ebola disease caused by Sudan virus (SUDV), after a case was confirmed in a village of Madudu sub-county in Mubende district, central Uganda.The case was a 24-year-old male who developed a wide range of symptoms on 11 September including high-grade fever, tonic convulsions, blood-stained vomit and diarrhoea, loss of appetite, pain while swallowing, chest pain, dry cough and bleeding in the\neyes. He visited two private clinics, successively between 11-13 and 13-15 September without improvement. He was then referred to the Regional Referral Hospital (RRH) on 15 September where he was isolated as a suspected case of viral haemorrhagic\nfever. A blood sample was collected on 17 September and sent to the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) in Kampala where RT- PCR tests conducted were positive for SUDV on 19 September. On the same day, the patient died.Results of preliminary investigations identified a number of community deaths from an unknown illness in Madudu and Kiruma sub-counties of Mubende district reported in the first two weeks of September. These deaths are now considered to be probable cases\nof Ebola caused by SUDV.As of 25 September 2022, a cumulative number of 36 cases (18 confirmed and 18 probable cases) have been reported from Mubende (14 confirmed and 18 probable), Kyegegwa (three confirmed cases) and Kassanda (one confirmed case) districts. Twenty-three deaths\nhave been recorded, of which five were among confirmed cases (CFR among confirmed cases 28%). Of the total confirmed and suspected cases, 62% are female and 38% are male. There are currently 13 confirmed cases hospitalized. The median age of the cases\nis 26 years (range 1 year to 60 years). A cumulative number of 223 contacts have been listed.Map of confirmed (n=18) and suspected (n=18) cases of Ebola disease caused by Sudan virus, by district, Uganda (as of 25 September 2022).",
        "Epidemiology": "According to the International Classification of Disease for filoviruses (ICD-11) released in May 2019, Ebola disease is now sub-categorized depending on the causative virus. Outbreaks of Ebola disease caused by Sudan virus are named Sudan Virus Disease (SVD) outbreaks. Prior to May 2019 all viruses causing Ebola disease were grouped together. Based on the results of laboratory tests, this outbreak is caused by Sudan virus.Sudan virus disease is a severe, often fatal illness affecting humans. Sudan virus was first reported in southern Sudan in June 1976, since then the virus has emerged periodically and up to now, seven outbreaks caused by SUDV have been reported, four in Uganda and three in Sudan. The estimated case fatality ratios of SVD have varied from 41% to 100% in past outbreaks.The virus is introduced into the human population through close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals such as fruit bats, chimpanzees, gorillas, monkeys, forest antelope or porcupines found ill or dead or in the rainforest. The virus then spreads through human-to-human transmission via direct contact (through broken skin or mucous membranes) with either blood or body fluids of a person who is sick with or has died from SVD or objects that have been contaminated with body fluids (like blood, faeces, vomit) from a person sick with SVD or the body of a person who died from SVD.The incubation period ranges from 2 to 21 days. People infected with Sudan virus cannot spread the disease until they develop symptoms, and they remain infectious as long as their blood contains the virus. Symptoms of SVD can be sudden and include fever, fatigue, muscle pain, headache, and sore throat later followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, symptoms of impaired kidney and liver function. In some cases, the patient might present both internal and external bleeding (for example, bleeding from the gums, or blood in the stools).The diagnosis of SVD can be difficult, as early nonspecific manifestation of the disease may mimic other infectious diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever and meningitis. Confirmation is made using numerous diagnostic methods including RT-PCR. Supportive care - rehydration with oral or intravenous fluids - and treatment of specific symptoms improve survival.There are no licensed vaccines or therapeutics for the prevention and treatment of Sudan virus disease.Uganda has reported four SVD outbreaks, in 2000, 2011 and 2012 (two outbreaks). Uganda also reported a Bundibugyo virus disease outbreak in 2007 and an Ebola virus disease outbreak in 2019.",
        "Public Health Response": "CoordinationThe Ministry of Health (MOH) established a National Task Force, with WHO providing technical support The Incidence Management Team was activated both within the MOH and the WHO country officeThe MOH Incident Commander has been deployed to Mubende District to support response efforts in the affected regionWHO is supporting the orientation of the leadership at the Regional Referral Hospital and the district health team on early identification and case managementA response plan is being developed and priority actions have been identifiedSurveillance and LaboratoryWHO has supported the activation of surveillance structures in districtsContact tracing and active case finding are ongoing WHO has deployed a technical team in Mubende district to support surveillanceCase ManagementWHO has supported the assessment of the isolation unit at the regional referral Hospital and dispatched an Ebola disease kit and tent for the isolation of patientsWHO has deployed a central team of experts to support the establishment of a treatment unit in the Regional Referral HospitalInfection prevention and control (IPC) teams were deployed to support capacity building of health workers in IPC and the establishment of screening and triage at all health facilities in affected districtsCommunication and Risk CommunicationAs part of the communication and risk communication activities, WHO provided technical support for the organization of the press conference on Ebola and the development and dissemination of a press statement by the Ministry of HealthCurrently, WHO is supporting the review of Information, Education and Communication (IEC) material for dissemination to the public",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Uganda has experience in responding to Ebola virus disease and Sudan virus disease outbreaks, and necessary action has been initiated quickly. The current outbreak is the first Ebola disease outbreak caused by Sudan virus in Uganda since 2012.\u00a0 In the absence of licensed vaccines and therapeutics for prevention and treatment of Sudan virus disease, the risk of potential serious public health impact is high. Community deaths and care of patients in private facilities and hospitals and other community health services with limited protection and infection prevention and control measures entail a high risk of many transmission chains. Investigations are ongoing to determine the scope of the outbreak and the possibility of spreading to other districts. Importation of cases to neighbouring countries cannot be ruled out at this stage.According to the information currently available, the overall risk has been assessed as high at national level considering: (i) the confirmed Sudan virus and the lack of an authorized vaccine (ii) the possibility that the event started three weeks before the identification of the index case and several transmission chains \u00a0have not been \u00a0not tracked; (iii) patients presented at various facilities with suboptimal infection, prevention and control (IPC) practices including inadequate use of personal protective equipment (PPE); the patients died and were traditionally buried with large gathering ceremonies; (iv) although the country has developed an increased capacity to respond to Ebola outbreaks over recent years, and has a local capacity that can be easily mobilized and organised with\u00a0 available resources to mount a robust response, the system could be overwhelmed if\u00a0 the number of cases increases and the outbreak spreads to other sub-counties, districts and regions, as the country simultaneously responds to multiple\u00a0 emergencies, including anthrax, COVID-19, Rift Valley fever and Yellow fever, as well as flooding and prevailing food insecurity.In addition, the outbreak was detected among individuals living around an active local gold mine. Mobility among traders of this commodity is likely to be high, and the declaration of the outbreak may cause some miners already incubating the disease to flee.The currently affected Mubende district has no international borders. Nevertheless, the risk of international spread cannot be ruled out due to the active cross-border population movement. In addition, investigations are ongoing to establish transmission chains and the scope of the outbreak is yet to be determined.At Regional and Global levels, the overall risk has been assessed as low.",
        "WHO Advice": "Effective outbreak control relies on applying a package of interventions, including case management, surveillance and contact tracing, an optimal laboratory service, implementation of infection prevention and control measures in health care and community settings, safe and dignified burials and community engagement and social mobilization. Community engagement is essential to successfully controlling outbreaks. Raising awareness of risk factors for Ebola infection and protective measures that individuals can take is an effective way to reduce human transmission. Early initiation of supportive treatment has been shown to significantly reduce deaths from Ebola disease. There is a need to strengthen surveillance and other response activities to contain the possibility of exponential spread. Based on available evidence the ERVEBO vaccine \u2014 used in the recent responses against the Ebola virus disease outbreaks \u2014 will not provide cross-protection against the Sudan virus disease.The Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) vaccine called Zabdeno/Mvabea against Ebola has only been approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) against Ebola virus disease and has not been tested against Sudan virus disease. This vaccine is administered on a two-dose schedule and requires 56 days between the two doses. The first dose provides protection against the Zaire ebolavirus and the second dose was designed to provide protection against other species of the virus, including Sudan. However, this multiantigen protection has not been demonstrated with clinical data.\u00a0 Even if the vaccine was tested and proved to be effective against Sudan ebolavirus, it would only provide protection some days after the second dose is administered. This means the vaccine is not appropriate for outbreak response. WHO advises against any restrictions on travel and/or trade to Uganda based on available information for the current outbreak.",

        "Location": "the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "In the past few months, there have been several genetically linked Sabin-like type 2 poliovirus (SL2) detections from environmental samples in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (hereafter the United Kingdom) and the United States of America.\u00a0\u00a0In the United Kingdom, since February 2022, the WHO Global Polio Laboratory Network (GPLN) located at the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC) in London has consistently detected Sabin-like type 2 poliovirus isolates in sewage samples collected from London. Samples collected on 24 and 31 May had sufficient mutations to qualify as vaccine derived polio virus type 2 (VDPV2). Subsequently, due to a new detection of the virus more than two months later, these samples were classified as \u2018circulating\u2019 VDPV2 on 8 August.\u00a0 As of 5 September, no human case associated with VDPV2 has been reported in the United Kingdom.\u00a0\u00a0In the United States of America, Sabin-like type 2 poliovirus has been consistently detected in environmental samples collected between 21 April to 26 August 2022 from Rockland County, New York State, and nearby counties. In late July, a case of VDPV2 was reported in an unvaccinated individual in Rockland County, who presented with paralysis. The case had no recent history of international travel. This is the first case of poliomyelitis reported in the country since 2013. Due to detection of environmental viral sequences (collected on 3 August and 11 August) containing more than five nucleotide changes, and both linked to the case reported in Rockland County \u2013 these viruses are now being classified as \u2018circulating\u2019 VDPV2.\u00a0 \u00a0The virus detected in environmental samples in New York State, United States of America is genetically linked to viruses detected in sewage samples from London, United Kingdom and in sewage samples collected between January to June 2022 from Jerusalem District, Israel1.\u00a0 \u00a0Figure-1 Detection of genetically linked cVDPV2 isolates in the United Kingdom and the United States of America from February to August 2022",
        "Epidemiology": "Polio is a highly infectious disease that largely affects children under five years of age, causing permanent paralysis (approximately 1 in 200 infections) or death (5-10% of those paralyzed).\u00a0\u00a0The virus is transmitted from person-to-person, mainly through the fecal-oral route or, less frequently, by a common vehicle (e.g., contaminated water or food) and multiplies in the intestine, from where it can invade the nervous system and cause paralysis and death. Initial symptoms of polio include fever, fatigue, headache, vomiting, stiffness of the neck and pain in the limbs. In a small proportion of cases, the disease causes paralysis, which is often permanent. There is no cure for polio but it can be prevented by immunization.\u00a0The incubation period is usually 7\u201310 days but can range from 4\u201335 days. Up to 90% of those infected are either asymptomatic or experience only mild symptoms and the disease often goes unrecognized.\u00a0Vaccine-derived poliovirus is a well-documented type of poliovirus that has mutated from the strain originally contained in the oral polio vaccine (OPV). The OPV contains a live, weakened form of poliovirus. On rare occasions, when replicating in the gastrointestinal tract, OPV strains genetically change and may spread in communities that are not fully vaccinated against polio, especially in areas where there is poor hygiene, poor sanitation, or overcrowding. Further changes occur as these viruses spread from person to person. The lower the population immunity, the longer this virus survives and the more genetic changes it undergoes. In very rare instances, the vaccine-derived virus can genetically change into a form that can paralyze \u2013 this is what is known as a vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV).\u00a0The detection of VDPV in at least two different sources and at least two months apart, that are genetically linked, showing evidence of transmission in the community, should be classified as \u2018circulating\u2019 vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2).\u00a0 cVDPV2 continues to affect different areas of the world.",
        "Public Health Response": "WHO, in coordination with national authorities, will continue to evaluate the genetic and epidemiological situation to determine the possible spread of the virus and the potential risk associated with these isolates detected from different locations around the world.\u00a0\u00a0Public health measures in the United Kingdom The United Kingdom Health Security Agency (UKHSA) is conducting further investigations including assessing the public health risk and implementing response measures. These measures include:\u00a0Strengthening the environmental, clinical and laboratory surveillance for polio.\u00a0\u00a0A catch-up campaign targeted at children aged less than 5 years of age in London was implemented in June 2022, and a supplementary booster inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) campaign targeting children aged 1 to 9 years in London was launched in August 2022.\u00a0Public health professionals, health professionals, and laboratory staff alerted to the detection of VDPV2 in London.\u00a0Health professionals reminded of the importance of checking newly registered children and adult routine immunizations are up-to-date, with an emphasis on under-immunized populations (new migrants, asylum seekers and refugees).\u00a0Local and regional laboratories requested to refer all enterovirus positive stool samples to the UKHSA.\u00a0Enhancing environmental sampling to assess the extent of the spread of the virus across London. In addition, a range of additional sewage sampling sites are being stood up across the country.Public health measures in the United States of America\u00a0Enhancing polio wastewater surveillance.\u00a0Ongoing activities to support polio vaccination and increase vaccination coverage in Rockland and Orange Counties in New York State. Planning underway to launch an immunization campaign to provide IPV to residents of Rockland County who have potentially been exposed to poliovirus.\u00a0Conducting testing for poliovirus in wastewater samples in New York and neighbouring States, as well as providing confirmatory testing for clinical specimens.\u00a0Coordinating surveillance for Acute Flaccid Myelitis (AFM) throughout the United States of America and enhancing surveillance for paralytic and non-paralytic polio in areas where poliovirus has been detected in wastewater.\u00a0Health advisories including information on polio, the situation in New York State, and polio immunization, have been released to health providers and hospitals across the State and in the immediate county of residence of the case.\u00a0On 9 September, a state disaster emergency due to polio was declared in New York State. The declaration allows additional health professionals, such as pharmacists, to administer polio vaccine and allows health practitioners to issue standing orders for polio vaccinations.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "The emergence of cVDPV2 in the United Kingdom and in the United States of America is a reminder that until polio is eradicated, polio-free countries will remain at risk of polio re-infection or re-emergence. The detection of this VDPV2 strain underscores the importance of;\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 maintaining high levels of routine polio vaccination coverage at all levels and in all communities to minimize the risk and consequences of any poliovirus circulation.\u00a0\u2022 having sensitive surveillance systems for the timely detection of VDPV importation or VDPV emergence.\u00a0Based on the WHO UNICEF estimates, the vaccine coverage for three routine doses of polio vaccine evaluated in children aged 12 months in the United Kingdom and United States of America were 93% and 92% respectively in 2021.WHO will continue to support the ongoing investigation, risk assessment and outbreak response by national authorities.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO reiterates to all Member States the importance of reaching and maintaining polio vaccination coverage of more than 95% in each district or municipality; maintaining high quality for three main surveillance indicators: acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) rate, percentage of cases investigated within 48 hours, and percentage of cases with an adequate sample; optimizing supplementary (environmental and enterovirus) poliovirus surveillance and updating national poliovirus outbreak response plans in order to rapidly detect and respond to new virus importations or VDPV emergence to minimize the consequences of poliovirus transmission and facilitate a rapid response. The thirty-second polio IHR Emergency Committee meeting held in June 2022, convened under the International Health Regulations (2005), agreed that the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and recommended the extension of Temporary Recommendations for a further three months.",

        "Outbreak name": "Cholera",
        "Date Reported": "13 December 2022",
        "Location": "Haiti",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "Haiti is experiencing a resurgence of cholera, with the outbreak initially reported on 2 October 2022 after more than three years with no reported cases of cholera, evolving rapidly, and spreading to all parts of the country.\nThere is also an ongoing complex humanitarian crisis that is rapidly deteriorating due to gang violence, socio-political conflicts, insecurity, fuel shortages, and economic instability. This has resulted in limited access to healthcare and essential services, including water, food, sanitation, and supply services. This situation makes the population of Haiti highly vulnerable to the ongoing cholera outbreak.",
        "Description of the Situation": "Between 2 October through 6 December 2022, a cumulative total of 13 672 suspected cholera cases, including 283 deaths (case fatality rate is 2.05%) have been reported by the Haiti Ministry of Public Health and Population from all ten departments in the country. Eighty-six percent (n=11 751) of all reported cases have been hospitalized. The Ouest department accounts for the highest percentage (89%, N=12 112) of suspected cases. Of the 13 672 suspected cholera cases reported, 59% are male and the most affected age groups are children aged 1 to 4 years (19%), followed by 20 to 29 years (15%) and 30 to 39 years (15%).A total of 1193 confirmed cases have been reported. Three departments account for 94% of the reported confirmed cases: Ouest (79%; n= 943 cases), Centre (13%; n= 156 cases), and Artibonite (2%; n= 28 cases). Laboratory confirmation was by rapid diagnostic test and stool culture was done for identification of Vibrio cholerae. Of the confirmed cholera cases with available information, 57% are male (n=680) and the most affected age groups are those aged 1 to 4 years (19%) followed by 30 to 39 years (15%) and 5 to 9 years (14%).As of 4 November 2022, a total of 368 suspected cases, including 14 confirmed cases and 14 deaths have been reported from the Port-au-Prince prison. These cases are included among the cases reported in the department of Ouest. Additionally, as of 21 November 2022, the Ministry of Public Health of the Dominican Republic has reported two confirmed imported cases of cholera, both from Haiti.Cholera was first reported in Haiti in October 2010. Nationally, a total of 820 000 cases of cholera including 9792 deaths were reported between October 2010 and February 2019. The last confirmed case in this outbreak was reported in January 2019 in I\u2019Est\u00e8re in the Artibonite department of Haiti. The country did not report a single case of cholera in the three years from January 2019 to January 2022. The current outbreak is also occurring in the context of a complex humanitarian crisis that is exacerbating the burden of disease and hindering response measures.\u00a0Figure 1: Number of suspected cholera cases (n=13 672) reported in Haiti from 2 October to 6 December 2022.\u00a0Source: Haiti Minist\u00e8re de la Sant\u00e9 Publique et de la Population (MSPP).

Data reproduced by PAHO/WHO.",
        "Epidemiology": "Cholera is an acute enteric infection caused by ingesting the bacteria\u00a0Vibrio cholerae\u00a0present in contaminated water or food. It is mainly linked to inadequate sanitation and insufficient access to safe drinking water. It is an extremely virulent disease that can cause severe acute watery diarrhoea resulting in high morbidity and mortality, and can spread rapidly, depending on the frequency of exposure, the exposed population and the setting. Cholera affects both children and adults and can be fatal within hours if untreated.The incubation period is between 12 hours and five days after ingestion of contaminated food or water. Most people infected with\u00a0V. cholerae\u00a0do not develop any symptoms, although the bacteria are present in their faeces for 1-10 days after infection and are shed back into the environment, potentially infecting other people. The majority of people who develop symptoms have mild or moderate symptoms, while a minority develop acute watery diarrhoea and vomiting with severe dehydration. Cholera is an easily treatable disease. Most people can be treated successfully through prompt administration of oral rehydration solution (ORS).The consequences of a humanitarian crisis \u2013 such as disruption of water and sanitation systems, or the displacement of populations towards inadequate and overcrowded camps \u2013 can increase the risk of cholera transmission, should the bacteria be present or introduced.A multi-sectoral approach including a combination of surveillance, water, sanitation and hygiene (WaSH), social mobilization, treatment, and oral cholera vaccines is essential to control cholera outbreaks and to reduce deaths.",
        "Public Health Response": "Emergency response activities are being conducted by the Haiti Ministry of Public Health (MSPP), WHO and other partners as below.Laboratory and Surveillance: WHO is supporting the Haiti Ministry of Public Health (MSPP) in strengthening epidemiological surveillance and laboratory capacity. Training of nurses and sampling teams have been conducted to perform rapid diagnostic tests in the Centre and Ouest departments. Given the complexity of land transport, WHO also facilitates the transport of samples to the National Reference Laboratory (LNSP) through United Nations Humanitarian Service (UNHAS) flights. A total of 35 samples from the Nord-Ouest departments have been transported to the LNSP.WHO is also supporting the Dominican Republic to strengthen its capacity to detect and respond to outbreaks and/or imported cases of cholera in its territory.Clinical Management:WHO supported MSPP to conduct field missions to Artibonite and Centre Departments. The field missions aimed to assess the quality of services provided in Cholera Treatment Centres (CTCs), the capacity for scaling up case management, and to determine the needs and gaps for the cholera response.WHO continues to provide essential medicines and medical supplies to the Health Directorates in all 10 departments by land and air, with 49 tons of supplies, such as ringer lactate, oral rehydration salts and infusion sets delivered in the last 15 days.In addition, WHO continues to support the MSPP in the coordination and quality assessment for Cholera Treatment Centers (CTCs). Currently, there are 70 active CTCs throughout the country: 22 in Ouest (including the CTC of the Civil Prison), 11 in Artibonite, eight in Sud and 6 in Sud-Est,, six in Grand\u2019 Anse, six in Nord,\u00a0 4 in Nord-Est, 4 in Nord-Ouest, two in Centre, one in Nippes.\u00a0\u00a0Access to safe WASH facilities:Training of the departmental health officials have been conducted on cholera outbreak response at the community level An investigation of WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) conditions in cholera hotspots have been conducted.Risk Communication and Community Engagement: In Haiti, WHO produced and distributed over 90 000 printed brochures and posters with cholera prevention messages in the Ouest Department, with the support of partner agencies and NGOs. WHO, in coordination with UNICEF and the Communications Unit of the Ministry of Health (MSPP), developed a communication strategy to support the cholera vaccination campaign.Reactive Vaccination Campaigns: As a part of the outbreak response, an emergency reactive vaccination campaign of Oral Cholera Vaccination (OCV) has been authorized by MSPP. The country applied to the International Coordinating Group (ICG) for OCV vaccine provision. The ICG partially approved the request for 1.6 million doses of OCV for implementation of the reactive vaccination campaign.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "The current cholera outbreak in Haiti, combined with the ongoing crisis related to gang violence, social unrest, and insecurity, has strained the health system\u2019s response capacity. The overall risk for this outbreak in Hispaniola is assessed as very high, due to the following reasons:The current socio-economic situation, ongoing humanitarian crisis, food insecurity and poor health conditions are affecting a large proportion of the population, leaving them vulnerable to the risk of cholera infection and recurrence of cholera. Limited access of the general population to safe drinking water and to sanitation facilities.Due to violence and insecurity, the public health system and international partners have limited human resources in Haiti, reducing the capacity to respond.Logistics issues, lack of access to fuel and insecurity lead to difficulties to import supplies and challenges to access the affected areas. Therefore, timely assessment of the epidemiological situation is complex. Additionally, for the same reasons the shipment of biological samples from healthcare facilities to reference laboratories is hampered. These challenges further increase the risk of undetected cases and delayed response efforts. The insecurity and access to fuel hinders the population's access to health care, leading to delayed treatment and potentially severe outcome.Considering the magnitude and wide spread of the cholera epidemic that is ongoing in Haiti, in conjunction with the complex humanitarian crisis the country is currently facing, the limited resources to control the epidemic, as well as the constant migration flows towards the Dominican Republic, the risk in Hispaniola is assessed as very high.In the Region of the Americas, considering the constant migration flow from Haiti to the countries and territories of the Region of the Americas, the heterogeneous capacity of the States Parties to detect and respond to cholera outbreaks, as well as the burnout of health workers from concurrent public health emergencies, the regional risk is assessed as moderate.The risk posed by the event on the Island of Hispaniola (Haiti and the Dominican Republic) at the global level is assessed as low.WHO will continue to evaluate the epidemiological situation.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO recommends improving access to proper and timely case management of cholera cases, improving access to safe drinking water and sanitation infrastructure, as well as improving infection, prevention, and control in healthcare facilities. These measures along with the promotion of preventive hygiene practices and food safety in affected communities are the most effective means of controlling cholera. OCV should be used in conjunction with improvements in water and sanitation to control cholera outbreaks and for prevention in targeted areas known to be at high risk for cholera as recommended by the Global task force for cholera control (GTFCC). Key public health communication messages should be provided to the population.Given the re-emergence of cholera in Haiti and the imported cases reported in the Dominican Republic, WHO recommends that Member States strengthen and maintain cholera surveillance in order to prevent and respond in a timely manner to possible imported cases or outbreaks. WHO does not recommend any restrictions on international travel or trade to or from Hispaniola based on the currently available information.",

        "Description of the Situation": "Source: Ministry of Health Uganda and WHO Situation Reports*Following a data reconciliation exercise, one case previously classified as \u2018dead\u2019 has been re-classified as \u2018recovered\u2019Since the last Disease Outbreak News published on 24 November, one new confirmed case of Ebola disease caused by the Sudan ebolavirus (SUDV) was reported on 27 November in Kassanda district. According to information shared by the Ministry of Health, the new case was a stillborn baby delivered at 28 weeks of gestation. The mother was infected with SUDV while pregnant and had since recovered and was in good condition at the time of delivery.Since the outbreak declaration on 20 September, to 5 December 2022, a total of 142 confirmed cases have been reported by the Uganda Ministry of Health. Among them, 55 deaths occurred leading to a CFR of 39%. In addition, 22 probable cases (all are deaths) have been also reported. The number of cases among healthcare workers (HCWs) remains unchanged since the last DON report, with 19 confirmed cases, and seven deaths.On 2 December, Uganda health authorities announced that all patients have been discharged from Ebola treatment units (ETUs) and that no more cases are currently hospitalized. As of 5 December, there are no active cases.As of 5 December 2022, out of 2564 contacts listed, 2167 (84.5%), have completed the 21-day follow-up period. There are currently 36 contacts actively being followed up in four districts, with a follow-up rate of 100%.Figure 1.

        "Public Health Response": "For further information on the public health response in Uganda by the Ministry of Health, WHO and partners, see the latest situation reports jointly published by the Ministry of Health and the WHO Regional Office for Africa: https://www.afro.who.int/countries/publications?country=879.Following a Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) Request for Assistance, as of 7 December, there have been 66 offers of support received from 23 partner institutions. Five experts are currently deployed through GOARN in the functions of case management, infection prevention and control and Go.Data implementation. Additional offers of support have been received for the functions of water, sanitation and hygiene (WaSH), epidemiology and surveillance, partner coordination and laboratory capacities. In addition to the GOARN Request for Assistance, partners continue to support the Ministry of Health led response across multiple areas. WHO held expert consultations to identify candidate therapeutics and vaccines for inclusion in trials throughout October and November 2022 and developed clinical trial protocols for both vaccine and therapeutic candidates against Sudan ebolavirus. The experts recommended that three candidate vaccines should be included in the planned ring vaccination trial: VSV-SUDV from Merck/IAVI, ChAd3-SUDV from the Sabin Vaccine Institute, and biEBOV from Oxford University/Jenner Institute. On 8 December, 1200 doses of one of these candidate vaccines arrived in the country and will be evaluated in a clinical trial.WHO is working closely with partners on the \u2018accelerated campaign\u2019 in Kampala, carrying out Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE) activities. A festive season RCCE plan was developed to orient RCCE activities in Uganda and prevention in neighboring countries during this period.WHO continues to support the Uganda MoH and collaborate with partners to implement Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) measures in health facilities to prevent onward transmission including development of a national IPC strategy for SUDV response, implementation of screening, isolation and notification of suspect cases and health worker trainings. The IPC ring approach has been implemented and remains in place to support facilities and communities in the event of a confirmed case is reported.Preparedness and operational readiness in neighboring countriesWHO has revised the prioritization of the surrounding countries after conducting a risk assessment. In addition to the six surrounding countries (Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, South Sudan, Rwanda and Tanzania) that were assessed to be at-risk, five additional countries, with important population movements to and from Uganda, have been included, namely Central African Republic, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Somalia, and Sudan. The Ministries of Health, WHO, in-country and international partners, are supporting SUDV preparedness and operational readiness activities in these countries.\u00a0Summary of the country\u2019s preparedness and operational readiness activities (no new updates for Djibouti, Somalia and Sudan):Burundi continues to strengthen its surveillance at points of entry and is prepositioning infection prevention and control materials at the district level. The MoH has also received international experts in the areas of case management and IPC. Efforts to scale up the functionalities of points of entry and Ebola treatment centers continue as well as public communication and sensitizations.Central African Republic is conducting screening and all alerts are being investigated. The national Emergency Operation Center has been activated, and the national Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan is being finalized.Democratic Republic of the Congo continue to conduct screenings at 42 points of entry including airports, seaports, and ground crossings. Samples have been collected from suspect cases and resulted negative for SVD. The MoH is conducting surveillance, case management and IPC trainings of all staff deployed to at-risk health zones.Ethiopia has been on alert mode since September 2022. The MoH is in the process of conducting the SUDV readiness assessment to identify challenges and gaps to increase its readiness capacities. At international airport, screening activities continue.Kenya is planning on participating in a simulation exercise. In addition, a training course was held on case management at national and subnational levels. The MoH has also completed the SUDV readiness assessment and reports gained capacities in response and will continue scaling up its efforts to address challenges and gaps.Rwanda continues to conduct screenings and investigating all alerts. There are no reports of SUDV cases in the country. The MoH is coordinating readiness activities at national and subnational levels. A trainer-of-trainers workshop will be conducted in the coming week on digitalized community-based surveillance for community health workers. As well, trainings on case management and safe and dignified burial will be in mid-December in high-risk districts. South Sudan reports having conducted screening in Juba and Nimule. All 28 alerts have been investigated and all are negative for SVD. Rapid response teams and health care workers in laboratory procedures are being trained in Juba and Yambio next week. United Republic of Tanzania has increased its readiness activities in the past two weeks by strengthening its call centers, and increasing screenings at points of entry. All alerts have been investigated and are negative for SVD.On 6 December, WHO Regional Office for Africa in partnership with Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, West African Health Organization, United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, UK Health Security Agency, Robert Koch Institute and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, implemented a two-day public health emergency operation centre (PHEOC) simulation exercise with 36 countries in the WHO African Region, to improve readiness to respond to public health emergencies.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "On 4 November 2022, WHO revised the rapid risk assessment for this event from high to very high at the national level, and from low to high at the regional level, while the risk remained low at the global level. As of 8 December 2022, WHO\u2019s assessment of risk remains unchanged. The risk will be continuously assessed based on available and shared information.",
        "WHO Advice": "Successful SUDV disease outbreak control relies on applying a package of interventions, including case management, community engagement, surveillance and contact tracing, strengthening laboratory capacity, safe and dignified burials.Health-care workers should always take standard precautions when caring for patients, regardless of their presumed diagnosis. Implementation of IPC measures in health care (e.g., hand hygiene, training of health workers, adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies, waste management, environmental cleaning, and disinfection etc.) with ongoing monitoring and supervision for implementation is required to reduce risks of health care facilities amplifying the outbreak. Ensuring the provision of safe and dignified burials, supporting IPC in community settings (including adequate WASH facilities, hand hygiene capacity and safe waste management) and community engagement and social mobilization are essential to prevent and mitigate ongoing transmission.Upon case identification, early diagnosis and early initiation of supportive treatment has been shown to significantly improve survival. There are currently no proven therapeutics for SUDV but candidate therapeutics are available and due to be used in randomized controlled trials.\u00a0 Care of SUDV patients should occur in safely designed isolation and treatment/care centers with trained health workers. Establishing active surveillance at points of entry is an essential component of the outbreak response to mitigate the risk of international spread due to the high cross-border mobility between Uganda and neighbouring countries.There are no licensed vaccines for SUDV, but there are candidate vaccines which are going be used in trials.WHO advises against any restrictions on travel and/or trade to Uganda based on available information for the current outbreak.",

According to information available for 40% of reported cases (n=20\u00a0982) the median age is 25 years (range: 0 \u2013 89) with males accounting for 60% of the cases. This is the second highest annual number of cases since 2000, the highest having occurred in 2019, when 101 354 cases including 164 deaths were reported (Figure 2 & 3).The most affected division is Dhaka, accounting for 70.6% of cases and 60.4% of deaths. Dhaka city, the largest city in Bangladesh, located in Dhaka division, has reported 64.5% (n= 34\u00a0071) of the total number of cases. Other affected divisions include Chattogram division (13.2% of cases and 24.8% of deaths) and Khulna division (5.5% of cases and 4.8% of deaths) (Figure 4).The high incidence of dengue cases this year is taking place in the context of an unusual amount of rainfall since June 2022, accompanied by high temperatures and high humidity which have resulted in an increased mosquito population throughout Bangladesh.

        "Epidemiology": "Dengue is a viral infection transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes and is found in tropical and sub-tropical climates worldwide, mostly in urban and semi-urban areas. The primary vectors that transmit the disease are\u00a0Aedes aegypti\u00a0mosquitoes and, to a lesser extent,\u00a0Aedes albopictus.Dengue virus (DENV) has four serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4) and it is possible to be infected by each. Infection with one serotype provides long-term immunity to the homologous serotype but not to the other serotypes; sequential infections put people at greater risk for severe dengue. Many DENV infections produce only mild illness; over 80% of cases are asymptomatic. DENV can cause an acute flu-like illness.There is no specific treatment for dengue; however, timely detection of cases, identifying any warning signs of severe dengue infection, and appropriate case management are key elements of care to prevent patient death and can lower fatality rates of severe infection to below 1%.Dengue was first recorded in the 1960s in Bangladesh (then East Pakistan) and was known as \u201cDacca fever\u201d. The establishment of the\u00a0Aedes aegypti\u00a0mosquito vector and urban cycles have made dengue endemic in Bangladesh. The growth factor of dengue cases since 2010 appeared to be linked to regional rainfall patterns (May to September) and is coincidental with higher environmental temperatures. Bangladesh\u2019s climate conditions are becoming more favorable for the transmission of dengue and other vector-borne diseases like malaria and chikungunya due to excessive rainfall, waterlogging, flooding, rise in temperature and the unusual shifts in the country\u2019s traditional seasons.",
        "Public Health Response": "The Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) has taken the following actions:Repurposed six COVID-19 dedicated hospitals in Dhaka city for dengue case managementEstablished dedicated dengue wards/dengue corners in Medical College hospitalsActivated Control Rooms in all district and Medical College hospitals for sharing awareness information and situation update with the stakeholders (including media and local leaders) to access the information locally availableConducted capacity-building activity on clinical case management by the inhouse trained facilitators at DGHS and trained 250 doctors and 300 nurses on clinical case management.\u00a0The MOHFW and WHO distributed a total of 284 000 non-structural protein (NS1) diagnostic kits to all the Upazila health complexes, district hospitals and Medical College hospitals in the country.Supplied adequate IV Saline and other supportive medicines for immediate response from the WHO-supported emergency buffer stock to health facilities all over the country. Blood banks are geared towards making platelets available for hemorrhagic dengue patients. Strengthened mass awareness campaigns \u2013 continued awareness through television and other mass media. The local ward counsellors have been trained in community awareness. The City Corporations carried out awareness programme and alerted building owners including buildings under construction to prevent water collection. Fines have been imposed on buildings where the Aedes larvae have been found. The local government engineering department (LGED) is leading vector control activities including the elimination of breeding sites and larvicidal and adult mosquito control using different insecticides such as Temephos and Deltamethrin among others.WHO supported pre-monsoon entomological survey through DFC, and is providing technical guidance to the outbreak response at the national level.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Bangladesh experienced a moderate rainfall during October this year which was unusual (monsoon is from May to September). Due to the untimely rainfall and favorable climate conditions, the density of the Aedes mosquito population is increasing. In addition, many people keep water in different containers like buckets and pots in their houses, enabling Aedes mosquitos to readily breed in such artificial collections of water. A pre-monsoon survey carried out by the health directorate earlier this year found a higher density of Aedes mosquitoes in the capital compared to 2021. Experts in the Communicable Disease Control (CDC) unit of the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) predicted a worsening dengue situation this year in Dhaka city unless preventive steps were taken. The CDC unit revealed its most recent monsoon survey in September and found that mosquito density was twice as high in Dhaka city as in the pre-monsoon survey.Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection caused by four dengue virus serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4). The predominant currently circulating serotype in Bangladesh is unknown at this stage, but limited serotyping has detected dengue virus 3 (DENV-3) and dengue virus 4 (DENV-4). DENV-3 has been consistently predominant since 2019 but DEN-4 has not been reported for several years. Dengue virus has the potential to cause epidemics resulting in high morbidity and mortality. There is no specific treatment. However, early recognition of dengue virus infection and appropriate clinical management can reduce disease severity and mortality among dengue patients. At present, the number of severe dengue cases and case-fatality rates appear to be increasing, likely due to late health-seeking behaviour and access issues. With the receding COVID-19 pandemic, the travel restrictions have been lifted. This has led to the movement of people to and from Dhaka. Although there have been concerted efforts by the Local Government Engineering Department (LGED), City Corporations, and the Ministry of Health towards curbing the dengue outbreak in Dhaka in the past few months, yet the continued movements have led to an inflow of possibly infected individuals with a potential to contribute to dengue transmission cycles. Vector control activities have been less intense in the other districts of Bangladesh. Dengue poses a significant public health concern for Bangladesh which experiences regular seasonal outbreaks of dengue. Furthermore, the clinical management of people who develop severe illnesses, often requiring hospital care, puts additional strain on an already overburdened healthcare system.",
        "WHO Advice": "The proximity of mosquito vector breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for dengue virus infection. Although dengue does not directly spread from human-to-human, Aedes species mosquitoes can become infected after biting dengue-infected individuals, thus creating a cycle of transmission capable of spreading dengue and leading to clusters of cases. The prevention and control of dengue depends on effective vector control. WHO promotes a strategic approach known as Integrated Vector Management (IVM) to control mosquito vectors, including the mosquito genus Aedes (the primary vector for dengue). IVM should be enhanced to remove potential breeding sites, reduce vector populations, and minimize individual exposure. This should involve vector control strategies for larvae and adults (i.e., environmental management and source reduction, biological control, and chemical control measures), as well as strategies for protecting people and households. Bangladesh should implement the IVM strategy developed in 2021. Vector control activities should focus on all areas where there is a risk of human-vector contact (place of residence, workplaces, schools and hospitals). Vector control activities can include covering, draining, and cleaning household water storage containers on a weekly basis. Space spraying with insecticide can be deployed as an emergency measure. Chlorination and application of suitable larvicides/insecticides for water storage in outdoor containers should also be considered. Personal protective measures during outdoor activities include the topical application of repellents to exposed skin or on clothing, and the use of long sleeve shirts and pants. Indoor protection can include the use of household insecticide aerosol products or mosquito coils. Window and door screens, as well as air conditioning, can reduce the probability of mosquitoes entering the house. Insecticide-treated nets offer good protection to people against mosquito bites while sleeping during the day. Since Aedes mosquitoes are active at dawn and dusk, personal protective measures are recommended particularly at these times of day. There is no specific treatment for dengue infection; however, early detection of cases, identifying any warning signs of severe dengue, and timely access to appropriate clinical management are key elements of care to reduce the risk for severe dengue complications and deaths due to dengue. Case surveillance should continue to be enhanced in all affected areas and across the country. Where feasible, resources should be allocated to the strengthening of laboratory sample referral mechanisms for the confirmation and sub-typing of the dengue virus. WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Bangladesh based on the information available for this event.",

        "Description of the Situation": "Source: Ministry of Health Uganda and WHO Situation ReportsSince the outbreak declaration on 20 September, a total of 141 confirmed cases and 55 confirmed deaths (CFR 39%) from Ebola disease caused by the Sudan ebolavirus (SUDV) have been reported by the Uganda Ministry of Health as of 21 November. In addition, 22 probable cases (all are deaths) have been reported since the beginning of the outbreak. Overall, 19 cases with seven deaths occurred among healthcare workers (HCWs).The weekly number of confirmed cases reported has decreased for the third consecutive week (Figure 1) after the peak observed in the week 17-23 October. During the week commencing 7 November, five confirmed and one probable case was reported, including one confirmed case and one probable death from a newly affected district (Jinja), in the Eastern Region of Uganda, which is 80 km distant from Kampala. The most recent confirmed case was reported by the Uganda MoH on 14 November, from Kampala district.Figure 1. Number of confirmed and probable cases of Ebola disease caused by SUDV by date of symptom onset, with 3-day moving average, as of 21 November 2022. Source: Ebola Virus Disease in Uganda Situation Report - 57A higher proportion of cases are male (57.5%), and the most affected age group is represented by those aged 20-29 years, followed by those aged 30-39 years (Figure 2). Around 25% of cases are reported among children under 10 years old, indicating potential household transmission.Figure 2. Age and sex distribution of confirmed and probable cases of Ebola disease caused by SUDV, as of 21 November 2022. Source: Ebola Virus Disease in Uganda Situation Report - 57Since the last DON published on 10 November, one newly affected district has been reported (Jinja), leading to a total of nine districts that have reported confirmed SVD cases. The most affected district remains Mubende with 64 (45%) confirmed cases and 29 (53%) confirmed deaths, followed by Kassanda with 48 (34%) confirmed cases and 20 (36%) confirmed deaths. Two districts, Bunyangabu and Kagadi, have not reported cases for more than 42 days.Table 1. Number of cases and deaths (confirmed and probable) of Ebola disease caused by SUDV, by district, as of 21 November. Figure 3. Map of confirmed cases and deaths of Ebola disease caused by SUDV, by district, as of 21 November 2022. Although there is significant improvement in surveillance activities in most affected districts, contact tracing gaps have been reported in newly affected districts. The suboptimal performance could be attributed to different factors, such as the non-reporting of probable cases, high population mobility including the movement of non-listed and/or missing contacts, and initial gaps in human and material resources. Surveillance strengthening plans have been put in place in newly affected districts.\u00a0Since the beginning of the outbreak, 4652 contacts have been registered, of which 3599 (78%) have completed the 21-day follow-up period.As of 21 November, a total of 700 contacts in five districts (Jinja, Kampala, Kassanda, Masaka, and Mubende) were under active surveillance. In the week commencing 14 November, the average follow-up rate was 65%, representing a decrease of 26% in the follow-up rate as compared to 91% the previous week. Follow-up rates have been particularly low in Jinja and Masaka, at an average of 42% and 53%.Figure 4.

        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "For further information on the public health response in Uganda by the Ministry of Health, WHO and partners, see the latest situation reports jointly published by the Ministry of Health and the WHO Regional Office for Africa: https://www.afro.who.int/countries/publications?country=879.In addition to responding to this outbreak, the MoH and WHO are also responding to an ongoing outbreak of Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) in Uganda, supporting clinical management and facilitating a referral pathway for the effective isolation and treatment of suspected and confirmed cases of CCHF and SUDV disease. Following a Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) Request for Assistance, as of 22 November, there have been 52 offers of support received from 21 partner institutions. Six experts are currently deployed through GOARN in the functions of case management, partner coordination and infection prevention and control. Additional offers of support have been received for the functions of water, sanitation and hygiene (WaSH), epidemiology and surveillance, and laboratory capacities. In addition to the GOARN Request for Assistance, partners continue to support the Ministry of Health-led response across multiple areas. WHO held expert consultations to identify candidate therapeutics and vaccines for inclusion in trials throughout October and November 2022 and to draft clinical trial protocols for both vaccine and therapeutic candidates against Sudan ebolavirus. WHO also requested the existing COVID-19 Vaccine Prioritisation Working Group (WG) to extend its COVID-19 remit to rapidly evaluate the suitability of candidate SUDV vaccines for inclusion in the planned trial in Uganda using similar considerations on safety, potential efficacy and logistic issues relating to availability and implementation. The experts recommended that three candidate vaccines should be included in the planned ring vaccination trial: VSV-SUDV from Merck/IAVI, ChAd3-SUDV from the Sabin Institute, and biEBOV from Oxford University/Jenner Institute. The first doses of one of these vaccine candidates are expected to arrive in the country soon.Preparedness and operational readiness in neighboring countriesWHO has revised the prioritization of the surrounding countries after conducting a risk assessment. In addition to the six surrounding countries that were assessed to be at-risk, five additional countries are being included, namely Central African Republic, Ethiopia, Somalia, Sudan and Djibouti. These countries have important population movements to and from Uganda. WHO has started to engage with these countries and will report their readiness activities in the next DON report.The Ministries of Health of the six neighboring countries (Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, and the United Republic of Tanzania), in-country and international partners, and WHO are supporting SUDV readiness actions. \u00a0Burundi is scaling up its operational readiness by coordinating with provinces and districts on upcoming activities such as the reinforcement of points of entry bordering Tanzania and Rwanda. In addition, training of community health workers and health care workers have been on going to enhance surveillance activities. As of 21 November, all alerts have been investigated and resulted negative for SUDV.Democratic Republic of the Congo has been focusing their readiness efforts on training staff at points of entry. As of 21 November, 98% of travelers at airports are being screened. In addition, the health zones have been strengthening their capacities in laboratory and case management. As of 21 November, all alerts have been investigated and resulted negative for SUDV.Kenya is strengthening their capacities in case management through conducting trainer-of-trainers and holding a comprehensive simulation exercise with WHO\u2019s support. \u00a0Points of entry at high-risk counties have been conducting screenings as well. As of 21 November, all alerts have been investigated and resulted negative for SUDV.Rwanda is updating its contingency plan to guide the efforts in scaling up its readiness capabilities. Specifically, there are advancements in the establishment of Ebola Treatment Units (ETUs). The Ministry of Health is also reinforcing its core capacities in infection prevention and control and case management. Specifically, WHO is developing and implementing a training package in case management. As of 21 November, all alerts have been investigated and resulted negative for SUDV.South Sudan has been enhancing its capacities in the areas of surveillance, case management and infection prevention and control. Health care workers at the subnational level have been undergoing trainings on SUDV management at health facilities. In addition, this past week, sensitization trainings for SUDV stakeholders have been completed. As of 21 November, all alerts have been investigated and resulted negative for SUDV.United Republic of Tanzania has conducted training in the areas of IPC including safe and dignified burials. Health promoters have completed trainings in risk communication and community engagement and in mental health and psychosocial support. As of 21 November, all alerts have been investigated and resulted negative for SUDV.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "On 4 November 2022, WHO revised the risk assessment for this event from high to very high at the national level, and from low to high at the regional level, while the risk remained low at the global level.The risk will be continuously assessed based on available and shared information.",
        "WHO Advice": "Successful SUDV disease outbreak control relies on applying a package of interventions, including case management, community engagement, surveillance and contact tracing, strengthening laboratory capacity, safe and dignified burials.Health-care workers should always take standard precautions when caring for patients, regardless of their presumed diagnosis. Implementation of IPC measures in health care (e.g., hand hygiene, training of health workers, adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies, waste management, environmental cleaning, and disinfection etc.) with ongoing monitoring and supervision for implementation is required to reduce risks of health care facilities amplifying the outbreak. Ensuring the provision of safe and dignified burials, supporting IPC in community settings (including adequate WASH facilities, hand hygiene capacity and safe waste management) and community engagement and social mobilization are essential to prevent and mitigate ongoing transmission.Upon case identification, early initiation of supportive treatment has been shown to significantly improve survival.Establishing active surveillance at points of entry is an essential component of the outbreak response to mitigate the risk of international spread due to the high cross-border mobility between Uganda and neighbouring countries.There are no licensed vaccines for SUDV, but there are candidate vaccines which are due to be used in trials.WHO advises against any restrictions on travel and/or trade to Uganda based on available information for the current outbreak.",

        "Location": "Saudi Arabia",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "From 29 December 2021 to 31 October 2022, four laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) were reported to WHO by the Ministry of Health of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. No deaths were reported. Household contacts for the four cases were followed-up by the Ministry of Health, and no secondary cases were identified. The notification of these cases reiterates the need for global awareness of MERS-CoV but does not change the overall risk assessment.",
        "Description of the Situation": "Since the last Disease Outbreaks News on MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia published on 7 April 2022, the IHR National Focal Point of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has reported four additional cases, with no associated deaths. Between 29 December 2021 and 31 October 2022, four cases of locally acquired Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection were reported from Riyadh (two cases), Gassim (one case), and Makka Al Mukarramah (one case) regions (Figure 1). Laboratory confirmation of the cases was performed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). All the cases were non-health-care workers, who presented with fever, cough, and shortness of breath, and had comorbidities. Three of the cases had a history of contact with dromedary camels and consumption of their raw milk in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. Three of the cases were male and the overall age range is 23 to 74-year-old.Since the first report of MERS-CoV in 2012, a total of 2600 cases with 935 associated deaths have been reported from 27 countries, in all six WHO regions. The majority of MERS-CoV cases (n=2193; 84%) resulting in 854 deaths, have been reported from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (Figure 2).Figure 1. Geographical distribution of MERS-CoV cases between 29 December 2021 \u2013 31 October 2022 by city and region, Saudi Arabia (n=4). Table 1. MERS-CoV cases reported between 29 December 2021 \u2013 31 October 2022\u00a0 Figure 2: Distribution of cases and deaths from MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia from 2013 to 20221",
        "Epidemiology": "Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory infection caused by a coronavirus called Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Approximately 36% of patients with MERS have died, but this may be an overestimate of the true mortality rate, as mild cases of MERS-CoV may be missed by existing surveillance systems, with case fatality rates counted only amongst the laboratory-confirmed cases.Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedary camels who are the natural host and zoonotic source of the virus. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts and in healthcare settings. Outside of the healthcare setting, there has been limited human-to-human transmission.MERS-CoV infections range from showing no symptoms (asymptomatic) or mild respiratory symptoms to severe acute respiratory disease and death. A typical presentation of MERS-CoV disease is fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Pneumonia is a common finding, but not always present. Gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhoea, have also been reported. Severe illness can cause respiratory failure that requires mechanical ventilation and support in an intensive care unit. The virus appears to cause more severe disease in older people, persons with weakened immune systems and those with comorbidities or chronic diseases such as renal disease, cancer, chronic lung disease, and diabetes.No vaccine or specific treatment is currently available, although several MERS-CoV-specific vaccines and treatments are in development. Treatment is supportive and based on the patient\u2019s clinical condition and symptoms.",
        "Public Health Response": "Follow-up of the household contacts was conducted for all four cases, and no secondary cases were identified.For the three cases reporting contact with camels, the Ministry of Agriculture was informed, and an investigation of camels was conducted. The identified positive camels were isolated. The Ministry of Health of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is working to improve testing capacities for better detection of MERS-CoV during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Between September 2012 and 17 October 2022, the total number of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection cases reported globally to WHO is 2600 with 935 associated deaths. Most of these cases have occurred in countries in the Arabian Peninsula. There has been one large outbreak outside of the Middle East in May 2015, during which 186 laboratory-confirmed cases (185 in the Republic of Korea and 1 in China) and 38 deaths were reported, however, the index case in that outbreak had a travel history to the Middle East. The global number reflects the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases reported to WHO under IHR (2005) to date. The total number of deaths includes the deaths that WHO is aware of to date through follow-up with affected Member States.The notification of the four cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East and/or other countries where MERS-CoV is circulating in dromedaries, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who were exposed to the virus through contact with dromedaries or their products (for example, consumption of camel\u2019s raw milk), or in a healthcare setting. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessments based on the latest available information.\u00a0 The number of MERS-CoV cases reported to WHO has substantially declined since the beginning of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This is likely the result of epidemiological surveillance activities for COVID-19 being prioritized, resulting in reduced testing and detection of MERS-CoV cases. In addition, measures taken during the COVID-19 pandemic to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission (e.g. mask-wearing, hand hygiene, physical distancing, improving the ventilation of indoor spaces, respiratory etiquette, stay-at-home orders, reduced mobility) are also likely reduce opportunities for onward human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV. However, the circulation of MERS-CoV in dromedary camels is not likely to have been impacted by these measures. Therefore, while the number of reported secondary cases of MERS has been reduced, the risk of zoonotic transmission remains.",
        "WHO Advice": "Based on the current situation and available information, WHO re-emphasizes the importance of strong surveillance by all Member States for acute respiratory infections, including MERS-CoV, and to carefully investigate any unusual patterns. Human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV in healthcare settings has been associated with delays in recognizing the early symptoms of MERS-CoV infection, slow triage of suspected cases and delays in implementing infection, prevention and control (IPC) measures. IPC measures are therefore critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV between people in health care facilities. Healthcare workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, at every interaction in healthcare settings. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol-generating procedures or in settings where aerosol-generating procedures are conducted. Early identification, case management and isolation of cases, follow-up and quarantine of contacts, together with appropriate IPC measures in health care setting and public health awareness can prevent human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV. MERS-CoV appears to cause more severe disease in people with underlying chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons. Therefore, people with these underlying medical conditions should avoid close contact with animals, particularly dromedaries, when visiting farms, markets, race tracks or slaughterhouses where the virus may be circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to. Food hygiene practices should be observed.

        "Description of the Situation": "From when the outbreak was declared on 20 September until 7 November, a total of 136 confirmed cases and 53 confirmed deaths (CFR 38.9%) from Ebola disease caused by the Sudan ebolavirus (SUDV) have been reported, representing an increase of 18% and 66% respectively since the last DON published on 28 October 2022. In addition, 21 probable deaths have been also reported since the beginning of the outbreak, with the last probable death notified on 29 September. Three additional cases and three additional deaths have been reported among healthcare workers since 28 October, resulting in a total of 18 cases and seven deaths among these workers.Since the last DON, one newly affected district has been reported (Masaka), leading to a total of eight districts reporting cases. The most affected district remains Mubende with 63 (46%) confirmed cases and 29 (55%) confirmed deaths, followed by Kassanda with 46 (34%) confirmed cases and 19 (36%) confirmed deaths. Two districts, Bunyangabu and Kagadi, have not reported cases for more than 40 days.As of 7 November, a total of 1386 contacts in seven districts are currently under surveillance, with a follow-up rate of 92%. In the week commencing 31 October, an average of 1586 contacts were followed up daily, a\u00a0 decrease of 16% from the previous week (week commencing 24 October) when a daily average of 1896 contacts were followed up. A total of 34 contacts developed symptoms during the past week. Since the beginning of the outbreak, 3867 contacts have been registered, of which 2237 (68%) have completed the 21-day follow-up period.As of 7 November, at least 2835 alerts have been received at a daily average of 71 alerts. Approximately 94% (n=2671) of all alerts received were investigated within 24 hours, of which 1120 were validated as suspected cases. The proportion of alerts investigated within 24 hours has been steadily increasing, and in the week commencing 31 October, nearly all alerts (657/659) were investigated within 24 hours, of which 31% (n=203) were validated as suspected cases.Since the beginning of the outbreak, a total of 2139 samples were collected (suspects, repeat samples, swabs), of which 419 in the week commencing on 31 October (+11% increase as compared to the previous week when 377 samples were collected and tested).Figure 1.

        "Public Health Response": "For further information on the public health response in Uganda by the Ministry of Health, WHO and partners, see the latest situation reports jointly published by the Ministry of Health and the WHO Regional Office for Africa: https://www.afro.who.int/countries/publications?country=879.Partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) have deployed staff to support the response activities in Uganda, primarily for case management, infection prevention and control and WASH, epidemiology and surveillance, laboratory, Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE) and Safe and Dignified Burials (SDBs). \u00a0Preparedness and operational readiness in neighboring countriesThe Ministry of Health in the six neighboring countries (Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, and the United Republic of Tanzania), in-country and international partners, and WHO are supporting SUDV readiness actions. These include the activation of multi-sectoral coordination mechanisms for SUDV; refresher training of rapid response teams; refresher laboratory training; infection prevention and control at health care facilities; activation/strengthening of surveillance systems for SUDV; community engagement and risk communication; screenings at points of entry (PoE) and assessment and reinforcement of case management capacities, among other activities.Countries are requested to cascade the operational readiness activities to sub-national levels in high-risk districts/states to stop the introduction of SUDV into their communities. A new online preparedness assessment tool has been developed to measure key performance indicators to quantify and document the functionality of preparedness capacities in multiple high-risk districts in Uganda and six countries neighboring Uganda to facilitate real-time monitoring of the actual readiness status.In addition, external stakeholders in these six countries will jointly assess preparedness. The Joint Assessment Missions (JAM) will evaluate preparedness at the national level as well as in high-risk subnational-level districts/states. The JAM reports will provide a detailed picture of preparedness capacities in all pillars and in all subnational areas that are at risk.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "On 1 November 2022, WHO revised the risk assessment for this event from high to very high at the national level, and from low to high at the regional level, while the risk remained low at the global level.The estimated very high risk at the national level is based on a combination of several factors including the lack of licensed medical countermeasures; the late detection of the SUDV outbreak and its spread to multiple districts (including to larger cities like Kampala, with a population of more than four million people and travel connections to many neighbouring countries); a highly mobile population with reports of some high-risk contacts and symptomatic cases traveling between districts using public transportation; despite significant case-finding efforts, there is a possibility that some contacts may have been missed; reported challenges with community engagement in affected districts; many cases have presented at various health facilities with suboptimal infection prevention and control (IPC) practices.The current outbreak is the first outbreak of Sudan ebolavirus in Uganda since 2012. Uganda has developed an increased capacity to respond to Ebola outbreaks over recent years and has a local capacity mobilized and organized with available resources to provide a robust response, but the system could be overwhelmed if the number of cases continues to rise and the outbreak spreads to other densely populated districts, as the country is simultaneously responding to multiple emergencies including outbreaks of anthrax, COVID-19, Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever, Rift Valley fever and yellow fever, as well as prevailing food insecurity.At the regional level, the risk has been assessed as high due to the lack of licensed vaccines and therapeutics, mass population movements within and across neighbouring countries, along with weak cross-border surveillance that further amplifies the risk of disease spread, and health systems that respond to multiple emergencies.The risk will be continuously assessed based on available and shared information.",
        "WHO Advice": "Successful SUDV outbreak control relies on applying a package of interventions, including clinical management, community engagement, surveillance and contact tracing, and strengthening laboratory capacity.Implementation of IPC measures in health care (e.g., hand hygiene, training of health workers, adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies, waste management, environmental cleaning, and disinfection etc.) with ongoing monitoring and supervision for implementation is required to reduce risks of health care facilities amplifying the outbreak. Ensuring the provision of safe and dignified burials, supporting IPC in community settings (including adequate WASH facilities, hand hygiene capacity and safe waste management) and community engagement and social mobilization are essential to prevent and mitigate ongoing transmission.Upon case identification, early initiation of supportive treatment has been shown to significantly reduce deaths from SUDV.Establishing active surveillance at points of entry is an essential component of the outbreak response to mitigate the risk of international spread due to the high cross-border mobility between Uganda and neighbouring countries.WHO advises against any restrictions on travel and/or trade to Uganda based on available information for the current outbreak.",

        "Date Reported": "7 November 2022",
        "Location": "Malawi",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "Cholera is endemic in Malawi with seasonal outbreaks reported during the wet season. Since 1998, cholera cases have been reported in the country with significant morbidity and mortality in affected populations, especially in the southern region, which is low-lying, flat, and prone to flooding during the rainy season.\nThe current outbreak, which started in March 2022 has affected 27 of 29 districts of Malawi and represents the largest outbreak reported in the country in the past ten years. The outbreak is taking place in the context of tropical storm Ana (January 2022) and Cyclone Gombe (March 2022) which caused floods leading to the displacement of a population with low pre-existing immunity that now lacks access to safe water, sanitation, and hygiene.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 3 March 2022, the Ministry of Public Health of Malawi notified WHO of a cholera outbreak after laboratory confirmation of a cholera case in Machinga district hospital on 2 March 2022. Between 3 March through 31 October 2022, a cumulative total of 6056 cases including 183 deaths have been reported from 27 of 29 districts in Malawi (overall case fatality rate (CFR) 3.0%) with active transmission ongoing in 23 districts as of 31 October. Five districts account for 79% of the reported cases and 68% of the deaths: Nkhata Bay (1128 cases and 31 deaths), Nkhotakota (811 cases and 40 deaths), Rumphi (783 cases and 13 deaths), Karonga (683 cases and 14 deaths), and Blantyre (650 with 26 deaths). The outbreak originated in the Southern region of Malawi with cases reported in Nsanje and Machinga districts. Currently, the most affected districts in Malawi are in the Northern part of the country. The most affected age groups are 21-30 years, and males are disproportionately affected.\u00a0Figure 1.

        "Epidemiology": "Cholera is an acute enteric infection caused by ingesting the bacteria\u00a0Vibrio cholerae\u00a0present in contaminated water or food. It is mainly linked to inadequate sanitation and insufficient access to safe drinking water. It is an extremely virulent disease that can cause severe acute watery diarrhoea resulting in high morbidity and mortality, and can spread rapidly, depending on the frequency of exposure, the exposed population and the setting. Cholera affects both children and adults and can be fatal within hours if untreated.The incubation period is between12 hours and five days after ingestion of contaminated food or water. Most people infected with\u00a0V. cholerae\u00a0do not develop any symptoms, although the bacteria are present in their faeces for 1-10 days after infection and are shed back into the environment, potentially infecting other people. The majority of people who develop symptoms have mild or moderate symptoms, while a minority develop acute watery diarrhoea and vomiting with severe dehydration. Cholera is an easily treatable disease. Most people can be treated successfully through prompt administration of oral rehydration solution (ORS).The consequences of a humanitarian crisis \u2013 such as disruption of water and sanitation systems, or the displacement of populations towards inadequate and overcrowded camps \u2013 can increase the risk of cholera transmission, should the bacteria be present or introduced.A multi-sectoral approach including a combination of surveillance, water, sanitation and hygiene (WaSH), social mobilization, treatment, and oral cholera vaccines is essential to control cholera outbreaks and to reduce deaths.",
        "Public Health Response": "Emergency response activities are being conducted by the Ministry of Health, WHO and other partners since the declaration of the outbreak in March 2022.Coordination and response: A costed national cholera response plan has been drafted to manage the outbreak. WHO and other partners are supporting the implementation of various activities aligned with the plan. National and district-level emergency operation centres (EOCs) have been operationalized to coordinate the response in collaboration with other health sectors and partners.\u00a0Surveillance: National rapid response teams (RRT) have been deployed to the affected districts.Surge staff have been deployed and additional staff have been hired to strengthen surveillance and case management in affected districts.Active case search for suspected cholera cases is ongoing in communities in all affected districts.\u00a0Health System Strengthening: Cholera kits and other supplies including oral rehydration salt, IV Fluids, antibiotics, rapid diagnostic test kits, personal protective equipment, tents, and cholera beds have been provided by WHO in affected districts. Supplies for case management and laboratory confirmation of cholera are being distributed to health facilities and the district laboratories although additional supplies are needed. Case management has been strengthened through the establishment of treatment structures and the provision of equipment. Treatment structures have been established in affected districts and private facilities have been engaged to facilitate prompt referrals.Cross-border meetings are held with health officials in Mozambique and Zambia.Reactive Vaccination Campaigns: As a part of the outbreak response, reactive vaccination campaigns of Oral Cholera Vaccination (OCV) were implemented in eight districts (Balaka, Blantyre, Chikwawa, Nsanje, Mangochi, Mulanje, Machinga, Phalombe) between 23 to 27 May 2022, targeting individuals aged one year and older. Cumulative coverage of 69% was achieved but in Blantyre district the coverage was 42%. In Neno district, two campaigns were implemented in August 2022 with 84% and 72% coverage achieved in each round respectively.The country applied to the International Coordinating Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision for OCV vaccines and has been awarded 2.9 million doses for use in areas with ongoing\u00a0outbreaks. Preparations towards a reactive campaign have been initiated.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Cholera is endemic in Malawi with seasonal outbreaks occurring during the wet season. The first major outbreak occurred in 1998 and was widespread in the southern region, with 25 000 cases reported. The country reported its largest outbreak occurring from October 2001 to April 2002, which affected 26 of the 29 districts, with 33 546 cases and 968 deaths (CFR 3%). A more recent outbreak occurred in 2019 \u2013 2020 with a total of 26 cases and one death. Since the beginning of 2022, 27 districts have reported cholera cases. The outbreak was largely confined to the south of the country, including the areas affected by the cyclones until after July 2022, when the outbreak spread to the North of the country resulting in a surge in cases. This upsurge in the number of cases is being reported during the country\u2019s dry season when normally there is low or no transmission of cholera in Malawi. The upcoming rainy season in November poses the threat of further disease spread nationwide.There is a continued risk for further increases in the number of cases and international spread. Confirmed cases had been reported across the border in Mozambique during the initial period of the current outbreak. In late September, a cholera outbreak was declared in Lago district in Mozambique which borders Malawi (through Lake Malawi). Currently, the most affected districts in Malawi are in the Northern part of the country some of which are on the border with Tanzania and Zambia. There is significant cross-border movement in the region with bordering countries and beyond. Given the history of cross-border spread of cholera during this outbreak, WHO considers the risk of further spread of the disease very high at national and regional level.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO recommends improving access to proper and timely case management of cholera cases, improving access to safe drinking water and sanitation infrastructure, as well as improving infection, prevention, and control in healthcare facilities. These measures along with the promotion of preventive hygiene practices and food safety in affected communities are the most effective means of controlling cholera. Targeted public health communication messages are a key element for a successful campaign.OCV should be used in conjunction with improvements in water and sanitation to control cholera outbreaks and for prevention in targeted areas known to be at high risk for cholera.  WHO recommends Member States to strengthen and maintain surveillance for cholera, especially at the community level, for the early detection of suspected cases and to provide adequate treatment and prevent its spread. Early and adequate treatment limits the CFR of hospitalized patients to less than 1%. WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions on Malawi based on the currently available information. However, as the outbreak is taking place in border areas where there is a significant cross-border movement, WHO encourages Malawi and its neighbouring countries to ensure cooperation and regular information sharing so that any spread across the border is quickly contained.",

        "Date Reported": "3 November 2022",
        "Location": "Spain",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "Public health authorities in Spain reported the detection of influenza A(H5N1) in two poultry workers on a single farm, following an outbreak in poultry confirmed on 20 September. Given the potential impact on public health, a multisector response including measures for control, prevention, and early detection was initiated in the poultry farm. The detection of influenza A(H5N1) in these individuals was likely due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. No evidence of human-to-human transmission of influenza A(H5N1) virus in this event has been identified to date.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 27 September 2022, the Ministry of Public Health of Spain notified WHO of a case of influenza A(H5N1) in an individual working at a poultry farm in the province of Guadalajara. An outbreak of avian influenza A(H5N1) in poultry had been confirmed on the farm on 20 September. Nasopharyngeal samples were subsequently collected from all 12 farm workers on 23 September and influenza A(H5N1) virus was detected in a sample from one of the workers (a 19-year-old male) on 27 September. He remained in isolation until 28 September when a second sample tested negative by RT-PCR. On 28 September, samples from one close contact of the case were collected, which tested negative for avian influenza by RT-PCR.Following response measures on the farm, all workers were tested again on 13 October. Influenza A(H5N1) virus was detected in a nasopharyngeal sample from another worker (a 27-year-old male involved in the control measures including cleaning and disinfection whilst wearing personal protection equipment) on 13 October. He had initially tested negative during the first round of testing on 23 September. He remained in isolation until 22 October when a second sample tested negative by RT-PCR. Two close contacts of his were identified and tested negative on respiratory sampling.Both cases did not have any symptoms. Samples were tested using RT-PCR at the National Microbiology Center.",
        "Epidemiology": "Zoonotic influenza infections in humans may range from asymptomatic or mild upper respiratory infection (fever and cough) to rapid progression to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, shock and even death.Human cases of infection with avian influenza viruses are usually the result of direct or indirect exposure to infected live or dead poultry or contaminated environments.From 2003 to 21 October 2022, a total of 868 human cases of infection with influenza A(H5N1), including these two cases, and 456 deaths have been reported globally from 21 countries. A total of three human cases of infection with influenza A (H5N1), one case from the United Kingdom in 2021 and two cases from Spain in 2022 have been reported in Europe to date.",
        "Public Health Response": "Coordination and response: A multisector response including measures for control, prevention, and early detection have been carried out in poultry farms according to the Practical Operations Manual of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Surveillance: A follow-up response including passive and active surveillance of exposed workers and close contacts has been initiated. Excluding the reported cases, all other individuals who were exposed at the affected poultry farm were monitored for seven days following the last day of exposure to infection and have not developed any symptoms. Laboratory: Virus characterization, and serological studies are in process. The samples from both cases were sent on 24 October 2022 to the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza at the Crick Worldwide Influenza Centre in London, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Infection prevention and control: In the affected farms, measures related to the control of the outbreak have been undertaken, including on-site slaughter of the birds, the destruction of contaminated materials that could carry the virus, and the cleaning and disinfection of the facilities. All participants involved in the culling process wore personal protective equipment.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Individuals are at risk of becoming infected with avian influenza viruses if they are exposed to infected birds or virus-contaminated fomites or environments.Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk for sporadic infection and small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. Therefore, sporadic human cases are not unexpected. The\u00a0detection of influenza A(H5) virus\u00a0in\u00a0nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal samples collected from\u00a0individuals in close contact with infected poultry or other birds, whether the individuals are symptomatic or not,\u00a0is\u00a0not unexpected.\u00a0Good quality serological investigations may be useful in\u00a0differentiating infection from contamination in these cases\u00a0and allow\u00a0for a better\u00a0assessment\u00a0of\u00a0the risk of\u00a0human infection.\u00a0\u00a0There was no evidence of human-to-human transmission in this event.In the current outbreak of HPAI A(H5N1) on a poultry farm in Spain, both human and animal health agencies have implemented public health measures. Based on the available information, WHO assesses that the risk for the general population posed by this virus is low, and for occupationally exposed persons, it is low to moderate.",
        "WHO Advice": "The reports of these two influenza A (H5N1) cases do not change the current WHO recommendations on public health measures and surveillance of influenza.WHO does not advise special traveler screening at points of entry or restrictions with regard to the current situation of influenza viruses at the human-animal interface.Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect and monitor virological, epidemiological, and clinical changes associated with emerging or circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health and timely virus sharing for risk assessment.When avian influenza viruses are circulating in an area, people involved in high-risk tasks such as sampling sick birds, culling, and disposing of infected birds, eggs, litters and cleaning of contaminated premises should be trained in the proper use of and provided with appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). All persons involved in these tasks should be registered and monitored closely by local health authorities for seven days following the last day of contact with poultry or their environments. In the case of a confirmed or suspected human infection caused by a novel influenza virus with pandemic potential, including a variant virus, a thorough epidemiologic investigation (even while awaiting the confirmatory laboratory results) of history of exposure to animals, of travel, and contact tracing should be conducted. The epidemiological investigation should include early identification of unusual respiratory events that could signal person-to-person transmission of the novel virus and clinical samples collected from the time and place that the case occurred should be tested and sent to a WHO Collaboration Centre for further characterization.Currently, there is no vaccine to protect against avian influenza in humans. WHO recommends that all people involved in work with poultry or birds should have a seasonal influenza vaccination to reduce the theoretical risk of a reassortment event. Travelers to countries with known outbreaks of animal influenza should avoid farms, contact with animals in live animal markets, entering areas where animals may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with animal faeces. General precautions include regular hand washing and good food safety and food hygiene practices. Should infected individuals from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during travel or after arrival. If this were to occur, further community-level spread is considered unlikely as this virus has not acquired the ability to transmit easily among humans.All human infections caused by a novel influenza subtype are notifiable under the International Health Regulations (IHR) and State Parties to the IHR (2005) are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic.

        "Description of the Situation": "On 20 September 2022, the health authorities in the Republic of Uganda declared an outbreak of Ebola disease caused by Sudan ebolavirus (SUDV), after a case was confirmed in a village in Madudu sub-county in Mubende district, central Uganda on 19 September.As of 26 October, a total of 115 confirmed and 21 probable cases, including 32 confirmed and 21 probable deaths (CFR among confirmed cases: 27.8%) have been reported. Overall, 15 cases with four deaths have been reported among healthcare workers.As of 26 October, 1844 contacts were under surveillance in nine districts of the country. A cumulative total of 3166 contacts have been listed since the start of this outbreak, of which 1194 (37.7%) have completed the follow-up period of 21 days.A total of 94 safe and dignified burials (SDB) have been undertaken since the beginning of the outbreak, of which 97.9% (n=92) were community burials.Figure 1. Confirmed and probable cases of SVD by date of illness onset and outcome (dead/alive), 20 September \u2013 26 October 2022.The most affected district is Mubende, which has reported 54.7% (n=63) of all confirmed cases, and in particular Madudu sub-county with 21 confirmed cases reported (18.2% of all confirmed cases). Since the previous week (20 October 2022), two additional districts reported new cases, bringing the total number of affected districts to seven.Table 1.

        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "For further information about the public health response in Uganda by the Ministry of Health, WHO and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa: https://www.afro.who.int/countries/publications?country=879 Vaccine developmentWHO initiated international consultations with vaccine developers to identify vaccine candidates against the Sudan ebolavirus that could be tested in randomized clinical studies in Uganda. Three candidate vaccines under consideration: cAd3, cAdOX1, and rVSV SUDV GP. The clinical study protocols are under review by the ethical and regulatory committees in Uganda.At each stage of the clinical study, WHO prioritization committee will be reviewing evidence collected on the effectiveness and safety of the vaccine candidates to inform response activities.Preparedness and operational readiness in neighboring countriesThe Ministry of Health in the six neighboring countries (Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, and the United Republic of Tanzania), in-country and international partners, and WHO are supporting Sudan Virus Disease (SVD) readiness actions. These include the activation of multi-sectoral coordination mechanisms for SVD; refresher training of rapid response teams; refresher laboratory training; activation/strengthening of community-based surveillance systems for SVD; community engagement and risk communication; reinforcement of points of entry (PoE) and assessment and reinforcement of case management capacities, among other activities.Countries are requested to cascade the operational readiness activities to the sub-national levels in the high-risk districts/states to stop the introduction of SUDV into their communities. A new online readiness assessment tool to measure key performance indicators has been developed to quantify and document the functionality of the readiness capacities in multiple high-risk districts in Uganda and the six countries neighboring Uganda to facilitate real-time monitoring of the actual readiness status.Additionally, readiness shall be assessed jointly by external stakeholders in these six countries. The Joint Assessment Missions (JAM) shall assess readiness at the national level as well as at the high-risk subnational level districts/states. The JAM reports will give a granular picture of readiness capacities across all pillars and throughout all subnational areas at risk.WHO is developing a checklist for community readiness to support early detection and local containment through enhanced community-based surveillance and readiness actions at border areas and communities in neighboring countries.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Uganda has experience in responding to outbreaks of Zaire ebolavirus and Sudan ebolavirus and necessary action has been initiated quickly. The current outbreak is the first outbreak of Sudan ebolavirus in Uganda since 2012. In the absence of licensed vaccines and therapeutics for prevention and treatment of Sudan virus disease, the risk of potential serious public health impact is high.On 21 September 2022, WHO assessed the risk of this event as high at the national level and low at the regional and global levels. The\u00a0WHO\u00a0rapid risk assessment (RRA) will be revised in the coming days based on available and shared information; however, considering the geographical expansion of the SVD outbreak to urban settings,\u00a0currently\u00a0the risk can\u00a0be\u00a0assessed\u00a0to be very high at the national level and high at the regional level and\u00a0remaining\u00a0low at the global level.",
        "WHO Advice": "Successful SVD outbreak control relies on applying a package of interventions, including clinical management, surveillance and contact tracing, a good laboratory service, implementation of IPC measures in health care and community settings, safe and dignified burials and community engagement and social mobilization. Upon identification of a case, early initiation of supportive treatment has been shown to significantly reduce deaths from SVD.WHO advises against any restrictions on travel and/or trade to Uganda based on available information for the current outbreak.",

        "Date Reported": "20 October 2022",
        "Location": "Mauritania",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "Between 30 August and 17 October 2022, a total of 47 confirmed cases of Rift Valley fever (RVF), mostly among animal breeders, including 23 deaths, have been reported from nine of Mauritania\u2019s 15 wilayas (regions). Circulation of the virus that causes RVF in animals (small ruminants, camels and cattle) has been confirmed in eight wilayas of Mauritania. Altogether, 12 wilayas have reported confirmed human or animal cases, including nine that share borders with three neighboring countries\u2014Mali, Senegal and Algeria. A One Health approach is being used to manage the epidemic response.\nThere has been a constant circulation of RVF virus in Mauritania with the country experiencing previous outbreaks in 1987, 2010, 2012, 2015 and 2020. Regional spread of the outbreak cannot be ruled out given the proliferation of the vector in the majority of wilayas, the animal density, and high human population and animal movement to neighboring countries.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 30 August 2022, the Ministry of Health (MoH) of Mauritania notified WHO of an outbreak of Rift Valley fever (RVF) following laboratory confirmation of a case by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at the National Institute for Public Health Research on 29 August. The case was a 25-year-old male who was an animal breeder from Tintane moughataa (also known as district), Hodh El Gharbi wilaya (also known as region). He initially presented to a health center on 25 August with hemorrhagic syndrome (epistaxis) with severe thrombocytopenia and was transferred the following day to a regional hospital, where he died two days later on 29 August.As of 17 October 2022, a total of 47 confirmed cases including 23 deaths (CFR 49%)\u2014mostly among animal breeders\u2014 have been reported from nine of Mauritania\u2019s 15 wilayas (Figure 1, Table 1). Among the 47 confirmed cases, there are more men than women (sex ratio of M:F cases = 4.4:1). The median age of the cases is 22 years, ranging from 3 to 70 years. Among the 23 deaths, nearly all occurred in hospitals and had symptoms that included severe thrombocytopenia and fever associated with the hemorrhagic syndrome (petechiae, hematemesis, gingivorrhagia).Figure 1. Geographical distribution of confirmed human cases of Rift Valley fever (n=47) and deaths (n=23) from nine affected wilayas in Mauritania, 30 August - 17 October 2022. Table 1. Number of confirmed human Rift Valley fever cases and deaths, per the nine affected wilayas, Mauritania, 30 August - 17 October 2022.Figure 2. Confirmed cases (n=47) and deaths (n=23) of Rift Valley fever by confirmation date, Mauritania, 30 August to 17 October 2022. Animal cases of Rift Valley feverWhile human cases of RVF have been reported in nine wilayas as of 17 October 2022, confirmed and suspected animal cases have been reported in 12 wilayas (eight confirmed; four suspected) (Table 2). An alert of potential animal RVF cases resulted from sentinel herd monitoring which notified animal deaths and abortions in Aioun moughataa, Hodh El Gharbi wilaya. The outbreak of RVF in animal populations was subsequently identified in Hodh El Gharbi and additional seven wilayas: Adrar, Assaba, Guidimakha, Hodh Echargui, Tagant, Tiris Zemmour, and Trarza. Between 18 August and 10 October 2022, a total of 1148 samples of animal origin\u2014cattle, camel and small ruminants\u2014were analyzed. Overall positivity was 24.1% (277/1148). Test positivity by animal group: 5.2% (5/96) were positive by ELISA IgM in cattle; 25.8% (113/438) were positive by RT-PCR in camels; 25.9% (159/614) were positive by ELISA IgM in small ruminants.Table 2.\u00a0Number of animals (cattle, camels and small ruminants) tested for RVF and results, by the 12 wilayas with reported cases, Mauritania, 18 August to 10 October 2022.",
        "Epidemiology": "RVF is a viral disease most commonly seen in domesticated animals in sub-Saharan Africa, such as cattle, sheep, goats and camels. RVF primarily affects animals but also has the capacity to infect humans.While some human infections have resulted from the bite of infected mosquitoes, most human infections result from contact with the blood or organs of infected animals. Occupational groups such as herders, farmers, slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians are at higher risk of infection.Humans may also become infected by ingesting the unpasteurized or uncooked milk of infected animals. No human-to-human transmission of RVF has been documented.\u00a0Although RVF often causes severe illness in animals, in humans, the disease ranges from a mild flu-like illness to severe haemorrhagic fever that can be lethal. Most people with RVF have either no symptoms or a mild illness (fever, weakness, back pain, and dizziness). However, a small percentage (8-10%) of people with RVF develop severe symptoms, including eye disease, hemorrhage and encephalitis (swelling of the brain).An outbreak of RVF occurred in Mauritania from September to November 2020, which involved 78 reported human cases and 25 deaths (CFR 32%)[1]. A total of 186 animal cases of RVF were reported: 94 camels, 89 small ruminants and three cattle.",
        "Public Health Response": "A\u00a0One Health approach is being used to manage the epidemic response, including the establishment of a One Health technical committee for a coordinated response at the national level. In the affected wilayas, coordination meetings bringing together the human health and animal health sectors are held weekly.The following priority activities are being implemented: Organization of daily meetings of the One Health technical committee for the management of this epidemic under the coordination of the Ministry of Health. Organization of in-depth epidemiological and entomological investigations.Development of regular situation reports.Sensitization of affected communities, in particular at-risk populations (animal breeders and butchers), on preventive measures and what to do in the event of abortions and deaths within herds, or the occurrence of a haemorrhagic syndrome in a person and active search finding.Supplying drugs and personal protective equipment (PPE) to health facilities in affected areas.Reinforcement of diagnostic and management capacities of health facilities in affected areas.Mobilization of partners for material and financial support resources.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "RVF is not unusual in Mauritania. The country previously experienced outbreaks in 1987, 2010, 2012, 2015 and 2020. Transmission can occur through carrier mosquito bites, contact with contaminated blood or tissues, and during the slaughter of animals. Confirmation of virus circulation in animals from several areas the majority of wilayas presents a significant risk of amplifying the disease in humans.The precarious environmental conditions, inadequate sanitation services in the affected localities, and high animal density contribute to the proliferation of vectors and the spread of the virus. The abundant rainfall recorded this year and flooding in most of these wilayas, combined with the dumping of waste tires, used containers and garbage, enhances the proliferation of vector breeding sites.The risk of spread at the regional level is moderate. Mauritania is an agro-pastoral country, and the movement of animals in search of water and pasture increases the risk of disease spread. Recurrent cross-border pastoral movements increase the risk of regional spread of the disease into neighboring countries. Fourteen of Mauritania\u2019s 15 wilayas have reported either confirmed human, confirmed animal or suspected animal cases[2], of which nine border Mali, Senegal or Algeria; specifically, the wilayas of Assaba, Adrar, Hodh El Chargui, Hodh El Gharbi, Guidimakha and Tiris Zemmour border Mali; the wilayas of Brakna, Gorgal, Guidimakha and Trarza border Senegal, and the wilaya of Tiris Zemmour borders Algeria. Moreover, RVF is not among the diseases subject to vaccination control of cattle at the borders; and transhumance\u2014 a practice characterized by pastoralism and movement of livestock under the care of herders \u2014is frequent within Mauritania and across the borders into Mali and Senegal. Livestock markets in some countries in the sub-region are supplied from Mauritania.The global risk is estimated to be low.",
        "WHO Advice": "Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a zoonosis that mainly affects domestic animals, in particular cattle, sheep, camels and goats. Human cases often occur close to outbreaks in livestock, in an environment conducive for local transmission of the virus by mosquito vectors. Most human infections result from direct or indirect contact with the blood or organs of infected animals. Precautions should be taken when in contact with sick animals or patients, as well as with their products and laboratory samples. No human-to-human transmission of RVF has been documented.\u00a0Public health messaging. Information campaigns on the risk factors for RVF transmission as well as protective measures, such as vector control and protection against mosquito bites, are essential to reducing the number of infections and deaths among people. Public health messages aimed at reducing risk should focus on the following:\u00a0 Reduce the risk of animal-to-human transmission through safer animal husbandry and slaughter practices, including practicing hand hygiene, wearing gloves and other appropriate PPE when handling sick animals or their tissues, or when animals are slaughtered.Reduce the risk of animal-to-human transmission from unsafe consumption of fresh blood, raw milk, or animal tissues. In epizootic regions, all animal products (blood, meat, and milk) must be carefully cooked before being consumed.Implementation of vector control activities (e.g. elimination of larvae in breeding sites), and use of insecticide-treated bed nets and repellents. Wear light-coloured clothing (long-sleeved shirts and pants) and avoid outdoor activities during times when the vector species is most frequently active/biting.Restrict or prohibit the movement of livestock to reduce the spread of the virus from infected to uninfected areas.\u00a0Animal vaccination. When implemented before an outbreak, routine animal vaccination can prevent RVF epizootics. Vaccination campaigns are not recommended during an epizootic because this represents a risk to generate virulent reassortments. As RVF epizootics in animals precede human cases, the establishment of an active animal health surveillance system is essential to provide early warning to veterinary and human public health authorities.\u00a0 Healthcare workers. Although no human-to-human transmission of RVF has been observed, there is a theoretical risk of transmission of the virus to healthcare personnel through contact with contaminated blood or tissue from infected patients. Thus, healthcare workers confronted with suspected or confirmed cases of RVF should apply standard precautions when handling specimens from their patients.\u00a0WHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions to Mauritania or the affected regions, based on information currently available on this event.",

        "Date Reported": "19 October 2022",
        "Location": "Lebanon",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "This report was revised on 21 October 2022 and the calculated case fatality rate has been deleted as it didn't include all confirmed and probable cases.\nThe Ministry of Public Health of Lebanon notified WHO on 6 October 2022 of two laboratory culture-confirmed cholera cases reported from the northern part of the country. As of 13 October, a total of 18 cases have been confirmed, including two probable deaths. This represents the first cholera outbreak in Lebanon since 1993. Responding to the current cholera outbreak may overwhelm the already fragile health system in the country.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 6 October 2022, the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) of Lebanon, notified WHO of two laboratory-confirmed cholera cases, confirmed by bacteria culture test, reported from North and Akkar governorates, northern Lebanon. The index case, a 51-year-old Syrian man living in an informal settlement in Minieh-Danniyeh district (North governorate), was reported to the MoPH on 5 October 2022. The patient was admitted to the hospital on 1 October with rice water stool and dehydration. Following a possible healthcare-associated transmission, the second case, a 47-year-old health worker, was reported, representing the first nosocomial infection of this outbreak.Immediately following the confirmation of the first two cases, active case finding in the informal settlement where the index case lived, identified 10 additional cases confirmed by bacteria culture test. In addition, Vibrio cholerae was found in potable water sources, irrigation, and sewage. These positive cultures were confirmed on 9 October.In Halba (the capital of Akkar Governorate), an additional two cases were culture-confirmed among Lebanese nationals. On 10 October, an additional four cases were culture-confirmed among Syrian nationals living in an informal settlement in Aarsal town of the Baalbek district.As of 13 October, a total of 18 confirmed cases have been reported. The most affected age group are children under 5 years (44.4%; n=8), followed by persons aged 45 to 64 years (22.2%; n=4), 25-44 years (16.7%; n=3) and 5-15 years (16.7%; n=3). Females are disproportionally affected in the outbreak (72%; n=13). Of the total cases, 11 (61.1%) were reported from the district of Minieh - Danniyeh, four cases (22.2%) from Baalbek district and three cases (16.7%) from Akkar district (Figure 1).In parallel, sewage water testing conducted in Ain Mraisseh in Beirut, Ghadir station in Mount Lebanon, and Bourj Hammoud also in Mount Lebanon, confirmed the presence of V. cholerae in all three sources, indicating that cholera has spread to two other regions of the country (Beirut Area and Mount Lebanon) located far from the initial confirmed cases.Figure 1. Map of confirmed cholera cases by district, Lebanon (n=18), as of 18 October 2022. This is the first outbreak of cholera in Lebanon since the last case was reported in 1993 with no local transmission documented since then.At this stage of the outbreak, laboratory confirmation of cases is done by bacterial culture and MALDI-TOF spectrometry which is conducted at the Department of Experimental Pathology, Immunology, and Microbiology at the American University of Beirut, a WHO collaborating centre.",
        "Epidemiology": "Cholera is an acute enteric infection caused by ingesting the bacteria\u00a0Vibrio cholerae\u00a0present in contaminated water or food. Cholera transmission is closely linked to inadequate access to clean water and poor sanitation facilities or can be linked to the consumption of contaminated food items. \u00a0V. cholerae\u00a0can spread rapidly, depending on the frequency of exposure, the exposed population and the setting. Cholera affects both children and adults, and can be fatal if untreated.The incubation period is between 12 hours and five days after ingestion of contaminated food or water. Due to the short incubation period of cholera, outbreaks can develop rapidly.Most people infected with\u00a0V. cholerae\u00a0do not develop any symptoms, although the bacteria are present in their faeces for 1-10 days after infection and are shed back into the environment, potentially infecting other people. Among people who develop symptoms, the majority have mild or moderate symptoms, while a minority develop acute watery diarrhoea with severe dehydration, which, if left untreated, can lead to death within hours.Cholera is an easily treatable disease. Most people can be treated successfully through prompt administration of oral rehydration solution (ORS).The consequences of a humanitarian crisis \u2013 such as disruption of water and sanitation systems, or the displacement of populations to overcrowded camps with inadequate access to clean water and sanitation \u2013 can increase the risk of cholera transmission, should the bacteria be present or introduced.A multi-sectoral approach including a combination of surveillance, water, sanitation and hygiene, social mobilization, treatment, and oral cholera vaccines is essential to control cholera outbreaks and to reduce deaths.",
        "Public Health Response": "The Ministry of Public Health has established a coordination mechanism with multi-sector partners including the Ministry of Energy and Water, WHO, UNICEF, and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).Response measures implemented, include the following:Intensification of active surveillance and case finding in high-risk camps, informal settlements and hotspot areas, including water quality monitoring (free residual chlorine).Training of trainers for the central and peripheral teams of the surveillance unit was held on 10 and 11 October, and will be followed by training of registered local physicians, hospitals, medical centers and public health centers (PHCs) at central and peripheral levels from 19 to 25 October.Updating of surveillance protocols.Designation of nine referral governmental hospitals to act as cholera treatment centers.Development of a cholera preparedness and response plan, in collaboration with WHO and UNICEF and in agreement with all healthcare partners, that includes the following, but not limited to:Improving capacity for early detection and ensuring proper linkages with WASH response through the support of integrated multisectoral field mission in the Akkar region.Circulars have been issued to hospitals, health centres and health workers regarding the necessity of informing MoPH of any suspected case. Distribution of 1000 Bioline rapid diagnostic tests.Initial stock of medicines required to treat 400 cases was secured.MoPH is exploring a potential request to the International Coordinating Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision for oral cholera vaccine (OCV) doses to cover 400 000 refugees and hosting communities including potential vaccination for prisons.The functionality of water testing laboratories is being assessed in eight hospital laboratories as a first stage to allow for quick, decentralized case identification in various Lebanese regions.A crisis cell was formed to coordinate the provision of clean water, water quality monitoring, and access to adequate sanitation, targeting vulnerable groups living in informal settlements.The associations of doctors and nurses and the Lebanese Society of Bacterial Diseases were contacted to develop training courses for healthcare workers on case management and methods of infection prevention and control, especially within health institutions.Collaboration with relevant ministries, especially energy and water, interior, municipalities, and the environment, to provide safe water and sanitation.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Lebanon\u2019s health system has been hard-hit by a three-year financial crisis and an explosion at the port of Beirut in August 2020 that destroyed essential medical infrastructure in the capital. In this context, responding to a cholera outbreak may overwhelm the already fragile health system in the country.According to The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Lebanon hosts the largest number of refugees in the world per capita and square kilometre, with 1.5 million Syrian refugees and about 13 715 refugees of other nationalities. Additionally, there is a large population of Palestinian refugees that are particularly exposed due to unsafe WASH services in various camps (Beqaa, Trablos, Beirut, Saida, Sour), possibly with limited medical services provided.Due to porous borders allowing free movement between Lebanon and neighbouring countries, the exportation of cholera cases is highly likely.The current cholera outbreak in Lebanon was reported six weeks after a cholera outbreak was declared in neighbouring Syria. On 15 September 2022, WHO assessed the risk of the cholera outbreak in Syria and predicted that due to shortages of drinking water and a fragile and limited health system in Lebanon, there was a risk of a cholera outbreak should the disease be introduced into the country. Power cuts, water shortages, and inflation have strained the already fragile health system in Lebanon. Poverty has also worsened for many Lebanese, with many families frequently rationing water, unable to afford private water tanks for consumption and domestic use.Since the last cholera outbreak in Lebanon occurred in 1993, there is a need to update cholera surveillance and case management guidelines and re-train healthcare workers.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO recommends improving access to proper and timely case management of cholera cases, improving infection, prevention, and control in healthcare facilities, improving access to safe drinking water and sanitation infrastructure, as well as, improving hygiene practices and food safety in affected communities as the most effective means of controlling cholera.Oral cholera vaccine should be used in conjunction with improvements in water and sanitation to control cholera outbreaks and for prevention in targeted areas known to be at high risk for cholera. Key public health communication messages should be provided to the population.Surveillance for early case detection, confirmation and response in other provinces and regions of Lebanon should be reinforced especially at the district level while expanding community-based surveillance.WHO does not recommend any restrictions on international travel or trade to or from Lebanon based on the currently available information.",

        "Outbreak name": "Malaria",
        "Date Reported": "17 October 2022",
        "Location": "Pakistan",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "From January through August 2022, more than 3.4 million suspected cases of malaria were reported in Pakistan compared with the 2.6 million suspected cases reported in 2021. Over 170 000 cases were laboratory confirmed, with the majority reported as Plasmodium vivax. A rapid upsurge in cases was observed in Balochistan and Sindh provinces after the devastating floods in mid-June 2022, together accounting for 78% of all confirmed cases. The risk is assessed as very high considering the current flood crisis affecting the capacity of the national health system.",
        "Description of the Situation": "Malaria is endemic in Pakistan. Between January and August 2022, over 3.4 million suspected cases of malaria were reported in Pakistan compared with the 2.6 million reported over the course of 2021. Over 170 000 cases were laboratory confirmed, of which 77% are due to Plasmodium vivax, and 23% due to Plasmodium falciparum, which is associated with the most severe and fatal cases. Pakistan was hit by devastating floods in June 2022 which resulted in over 33 million people being affected, 81 districts being declared as calamity hit and the health infrastructure being badly impacted. A rapid upsurge in reported malaria cases was observed after the floods. In Sindh province, confirmed malaria cases in August 2022 reached 69 123 compared to 19 826 cases reported in August 2021. In Balochistan province, 41 368 confirmed cases were reported in August 2022 compared to 22 032 confirmed cases in August 2021. These two provinces together account for 78% of all reported confirmed cases in Pakistan in 2022. Reports from 62 high-burden districts indicate that additional 210 715 cases were reported in September 2022, compared to 178 657 cases reported in the same districts in August 2022.",
        "Epidemiology": "Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to people through the bites of infected female\u00a0Anopheles\u00a0mosquitoes. Malaria transmission is also possible through blood transfusion, organ transplantation, or the sharing of needles or syringes contaminated with infected blood. Malaria can also be transmitted from mother to child before or during delivery.There are five parasite species that cause malaria in humans, of which two of these species pose the greatest public health threat, namely\u00a0Plasmodium\u00a0falciparum\u00a0and\u00a0Plasmodium\u00a0vivax.\u00a0Both parasite species are reported in Pakistan, with\u00a0P. vivax\u00a0representing the most predominant parasite (>80%).The first symptoms \u2013 fever, headache and chills \u2013 usually appear within 10\u201315 days after the infective mosquito bite and may be mild and difficult to recognize as malaria. Left untreated, malaria can progress to severe illness and death within a period of 24 hours.",
        "Public Health Response": "The Government of Pakistan is leading the response with support from WHO and other implementing partners. The following actions have been implemented:Health needs assessment was conducted in July 2022 together with other UN agencies.Implementation and strengthening of integrated disease surveillance and response (IDSR) activities in flood-affected districts and utilization of DHIS2 tool for daily reporting of diseases.Mass distribution campaign for long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) was conducted in 13 outbreak and flood-hit districts by the provincial disaster management authority. An additional 600 000 LLINs have been handed over to health authorities in Sindh and Balochistan provinces for distribution to displaced populations in flood-affected districts.Additional teams were deployed to support vector surveillance.WHO provided support through coordination at multiple high-level meetings for health authorities, including enhancing liaison and coordination with provinces and partners, and the constitution of a national task force for emergency response.WHO has mobilized rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and antimalarial medicines to the provinces; about 230 000 RDTs have been provided for malaria and other diseases including acute watery diarrhea, dengue, hepatitis A & E, and chikungunya.WHO is supporting the development of a 6-month contingency plan for submission to the Global Fund.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Malaria is one of the leading causes of illness and death in Pakistan. Intense transmission occurs mainly in districts located in regions bordering the Islamic Republic of Iran and Afghanistan and along the coastal belt in Sindh and Balochistan provinces. In addition, there is high population movement between Pakistan and its border countries (Afghanistan and the Islamic Republic of Iran), particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province with over 1 million Afghani refugees. Of these, nearly 800 000 refugees live in districts officially notified as calamity hit by floods, therefore the risk of international spread of the disease cannot be ruled out.Over 33 million people have been affected by the floods and 81 districts have been declared as calamity hit. The health infrastructure was also damaged with rapid assessments indicating some 1543 health facilities and their contents have been damaged.Given the current situation in Pakistan and limited access to health facilities and insufficient healthcare workers and essential medical supplies, there is an increased risk of serious health impacts from malaria and other ongoing outbreaks including COVID-19, acute watery diarrhoea, typhoid, measles, leishmaniasis, HIV, and polio. The risk is assessed as very high considering the current flood crisis affecting the capacity of the national health system. Many challenges to response measures surfaced when some flood-affected districts reported a doubling in incidence rates, a high P. falciparum ratio, and limited stocks of emergency medicines, insecticides and supplies accompanied with a long lead time for procurement. The lack of resources to adequately scale-up precautionary vector-control measures will certainly increase the spread of malaria and other vector-borne diseases.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO recommends malaria prevention tools and strategies including effective vector control and the use of preventive antimalarial drugs to reduce the global burden of the disease. Also, strengthening malaria surveillance is important to identify high-risk areas or populations prone to infection, enable the monitoring of changing disease patterns, and assist in designing effective public health interventions. Continued delivery of key public health messages on reducing the risk of malaria transmission among the population represents another important tool for malaria prevention and control.Early diagnosis and treatment of malaria reduce disease severity, prevent deaths, and contribute to reducing onward malaria transmission. WHO recommends that all suspected cases of malaria be confirmed using parasite-based diagnostic testing (through either microscopy or a rapid diagnostic test). Diagnostic testing enables health providers to swiftly distinguish between malarial and non-malarial fevers, facilitating appropriate treatment.At this stage, case management of malaria represents a critical priority to respond to the malaria situation in Pakistan, including the availability of medicines and RDTs. Preventative measures to reduce malaria transmission also include the use of LLINs and indoor residual spraying (IRS). Vector control is a vital component of malaria control and elimination strategies as it is highly effective in preventing infection and reducing disease transmission. However, there is a limited number of LLINs available, and the distributed ones are not enough; also, the usage of LLIN by flood-affected people is not high. Additionally, available resources for IRS are extremely limited at this stage.Since October 2021, WHO also recommends the broad use of the RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine among children living in regions with moderate to high P. falciparum malaria transmission. The vaccine has been shown to significantly reduce malaria, and deadly severe malaria infection, among young children.WHO does not recommend any general travel or trade restrictions to Pakistan based on the information available for this event.",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "Between 1 January and 27 September 2022, a total of 25 932 confirmed dengue cases and 62 deaths (CFR 0.25%) were reported in Pakistan, with 74% of these cases reported in the month of September alone. The current surge in cases follows unprecedented flooding that began in mid-June 2022. With the current flood crisis affecting the national health system capacity and the growing humanitarian situation, there is a high risk of serious health impacts from dengue fever and other concurrent disease outbreaks. High population movement between Pakistan and bordering countries (in particular, Afghanistan and the Islamic Republic of Iran) means that the international transmission of dengue fever cannot be ruled out.",
        "Description of the Situation": "Dengue fever is endemic to Pakistan, which experiences year-round transmission with seasonal peaks. However, triggered by the worst flooding in the country\u2019s history that began in mid-June, the number of reported dengue cases is significantly\nhigher in 2022 (between January and September) as compared to the same period during the four previous years.Between 1 January to 27 September\u00a02022, according to the National Institute of Health-Islamabad, a cumulative total of 25 932 confirmed dengue cases and 62 deaths have been reported nationally. Three-quarters (74%) of these cases were reported\nduring the month of September alone. As of 22 September, the distribution of cases by province was available for 83% (n=21 777) of the total cases, of which 32% (n=6888) were reported from Sindh, 29% (n=6255) from Punjab (including the Islamabad\nCapital Territory), 25% (n=5506) from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and 14% (n=3128) from Balochistan (Figure 1).Figure 1. Distribution of confirmed dengue cases in Pakistan by province, 1 January to 22 September 2022.",
        "Epidemiology": "Dengue is a viral infection transmitted by mosquitoes caused by four types of dengue virus (DENV 1, DENV 2, DENV 3, DENV 4).\u00a0Infection with one serotype provides long-term immunity to the homologous serotype, but not to other serotypes; sequential infections put people at greater risk of severe dengue. DENV can cause an acute flu-like illness, many DENV infections produce only mild illness; over 80% of cases are asymptomatic.There is no specific treatment for dengue, however, timely detection of cases, identifying any warning signs of severe dengue infection, and appropriate case management are key elements of care to prevent patient death and can lower fatality rates of severe infection to below 1%.Dengue fever is endemic\u00a0in Pakistan, with seasonal outbreaks and the circulation of the four serotypes in different areas of the country.\u00a0Aedes aegypti\u00a0and\u00a0Aedes albopictus\u00a0are widely adapted vectors for urban and\u00a0peri-urban\u00a0environments.\u00a0As dengue is recurrent in the country, the population may be at risk of re-infection and therefore,\u00a0serious complications may occur if not managed promptly and correctly.",
        "Public Health Response": "The Ministry of Health, in collaboration with the Global Fund, is conducting vector surveillance and control activities as a part of Integrated Vector Management, including:Technical weekly committee meetings chaired by the Ministry of Health.Activation of \u2018dengue counters\u2019 in all health facilities; designated areas in emergency departments allocated for receiving suspected dengue cases. Enhancement of vector surveillance activities in Lahore and other districts.Provision of additional teams to support vector surveillance activities including the daily situation analysis.The WHO is providing support including:Coordination at multiple high-level meetings for health authorities including visits and meetings of the WHO representative. Strengthening of\u00a0laboratory\u00a0and hospital-based disease surveillance across all provinces in the country has been initiated. Training of selected\u00a0health\u00a0care providers from all provinces in the country is being held on case management of\u00a0dengue fever. Training on vector surveillance and vector control\u00a0including source reduction during house visits is underway.Provision of 230 000 rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for dengue and other diseases, including malaria, acute watery diarrhoea, chikungunya, hepatitis A and E.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Pakistan is experiencing an abnormal monsoon rainfall and unprecedented floods. One-third of the country and an estimated 33 million people have been impacted in 84 calamity declared districts. More than 2 million houses have been destroyed and an estimated 1460 health facilities have also reportedly been damaged. Some 7.9 million people are reportedly displaced, 12 900 people injured, and 1600 people have died. Heavy rains and floods have left millions of people without access to healthcare and medical treatment.With the current flood crisis affecting the national health system capacity, there is a high risk of serious health impacts from dengue fever.\u00a0 Currently, there is a need for improved vector surveillance, enhanced laboratory capacity for better detection, sensitization of health care providers on case management (including warning signs of severe dengue) and improved surveillance of acute febrile illness to better define disease burden and seasonality patterns. Vector-borne epidemics \u2013 including dengue \u2013 after flooding is a well-known phenomenon, as the stagnant water provides favorable habitats for mosquitoes to breed. The lag time is usually around 3-4 weeks before the occurrence of dengue cases.Ongoing disease outbreaks in Pakistan, including acute watery diarrhoea, dengue, malaria, measles, polio, and COVID-19 are being further aggravated, particularly in internally displaced persons and refugee camps and where water and sanitation facilities have been damaged.Dengue fever is the most rapidly spreading mosquito-borne virus infection in the world. There is high population movement between Pakistan\u2014in particular, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province\u2014 and bordering countries, especially the Islamic Republic of Iran and Afghanistan. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province is also home to 1 200 000 Afghani refugees, of which 800 000 live in districts officially notified as calamity hit by floods. The transmission of dengue fever from Pakistan to border countries cannot be ruled out.",
        "WHO Advice": "The proximity of mosquito vector breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for dengue virus infection.\u00a0There is no specific treatment for dengue infection, but early detection and access to appropriate healthcare reduce mortality.\u00a0Furthermore, the prevention and control of dengue depend on effective vector surveillance and control.\u00a0WHO promotes the strategic approach known as Integrated Vector Management (IVM) to control mosquito activity and population, including\u00a0Aedes\u00a0spp.\u00a0(the vector of dengue).\u00a0IVM activities should be enhanced to remove potential breeding sites, reduce vector populations, and minimize individual exposure.\u00a0This should involve vector control strategies for larvae and adults (i.e.\u00a0environmental management and source reduction, and chemical control measures), as well as strategies for protecting people and households.\u00a0Vector control activities should focus on all areas where there is human-vector contact (place of residence, workplaces, schools and hospitals).\u00a0Vector control activities can include covering, draining and cleaning household water storage containers on a weekly basis.\u00a0In addition, this may include chlorination of drinking water and application of suitable larvicides/insecticides for water storage in outdoor containers.\u00a0Where indoor biting occurs,\u00a0application of mosquito repellent lotion or sprays on the skin, use of\u00a0household insecticide aerosol products, mosquito coils, or other insecticide vaporizers\u00a0are recommended. Household fixtures such as window and door screens and air conditioning can also reduce bites. Since\u00a0Aedes\u00a0spp mosquitoes (the primary vector for transmission) are\u00a0day biters with peak activity at dawn and dusk, personal protective measures such as\u00a0the\u00a0use of clothing\u00a0to minimize\u00a0skin exposure\u00a0are\u00a0recommended.\u00a0During outdoor activities, mosquito repellents may be applied to exposed skin or to clothing.\u00a0Insecticide-treated nets offer good protection to people who sleep outside or during the day (e.g.\u00a0infants, people confined to bed, and night\u00a0workers) and at night to prevent mosquito bites.\u00a0In addition, vector and human case surveillance should continue to be enhanced in all affected areas and across the country.\u00a0Key public health messages on reducing the risk of dengue transmission among the population are expected to continue to be provided.\u00a0WHO does not recommend any general travel or trade restrictions\u00a0to\u00a0Pakistan based on the information available for this\u00a0event.",

        "Date Reported": "12 October 2022",
        "Location": "Haiti",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "After more than 3 years with no reported cases of cholera in Haiti, on 2 October 2022, the national authorities reported two confirmed cases of Vibrio cholerae O1 in the greater Port-au-Prince area.\nThe current cholera outbreak is taking place in Port-au-Prince and Cit\u00e9 Soleil. These are areas that are experiencing civil unrest with several thousand people having been displaced as a result of the increase in violence.",
        "Description of the Situation": "Between 25 September and 8 October 2022, the Haiti Ministry of Public Health and Population (MSPP per its acronym in French) reported 32 laboratory-confirmed cases of Vibrio cholerae (including two identified as serogroup O1), and 224 suspected cases from Port-au-Prince and Cit\u00e9 Soleil. A total of 189 cases have been hospitalized, of which 16 deaths have been reported. Of the total reported cases, 55% are males and 49% are aged 19 years or younger. The most affected age group is 1 to 4-year-olds (Figure 3).The first cholera outbreak was reported in Haiti in October 2010. Nationally, a total of 820 000 cases of cholera including 9792 deaths were reported between October 2010 and February 2019 (Figure 4). The last confirmed case of cholera was reported in January 2019 in I\u2019Est\u00e8re in the Artibonite department of Haiti. The country did not report a single confirmed case of cholera in the three years from January 2019 to January 2022.",
        "Epidemiology": "Cholera is an acute enteric infection caused by ingesting the bacteria\u00a0Vibrio cholerae\u00a0present in contaminated water or food. It is mainly linked to inadequate sanitation and insufficient access to safe drinking water. It is an extremely virulent disease that can cause severe acute watery diarrhoea resulting in high morbidity and mortality, and can spread rapidly, depending on the frequency of exposure, the exposed population and the setting. Cholera affects both children and adults and can be fatal if untreated.The incubation period is between 12 hours and five days after ingestion of contaminated food or water. Most people infected with\u00a0V. cholerae\u00a0do not develop any symptoms, although the bacteria are present in their faeces for 1-10 days after infection and are shed back into the environment, potentially infecting other people. Among people who develop symptoms, the majority have mild or moderate symptoms, while a minority develop acute watery diarrhoea with severe dehydration. Cholera is an easily treatable disease. Most people can be treated successfully through prompt administration of oral rehydration solution (ORS).The consequences of a humanitarian crisis \u2013 such as disruption of water and sanitation systems, or the displacement of populations to inadequate and overcrowded camps \u2013 can increase the risk of cholera transmission, should the bacteria be present or introduced.A multisectoral approach including a combination of surveillance, water, sanitation and hygiene, social mobilization, treatment, and oral cholera vaccines is essential to control cholera outbreaks and to reduce deaths.",
        "Public Health Response": "Emergency response activities are being conducted by the Ministry of Health, WHO and other partners as below.The Incident Management Support Team (IMST) has been activated for outbreak response activitiesRegular epidemiological alerts are being published by WHO for enhanced information sharing and wider community awareness about the current epidemiological situation.Updated information on the event has been provided to the other Member States through the International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Points (NFPs) network.Support has been provided to Haiti health authorities for control and response actions as well as resources such as cholera kits.Event-based surveillance has been strengthened to monitor official and unofficial reports for information regarding the local situation. The multisectoral response plan has been developed with a focus on case management, water, hygiene and sanitation (WASH), vaccination, communication and psychosocial support, strengthening preparedness in unaffected departments, and advocating to improve security conditions to facilitate the response.WHO is working in coordination with the public health authorities to characterize this event and support the response.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "The current cholera outbreak in Haiti, combined with the ongoing crisis related to gang violence, social unrest, and insecurity, has strained the health system\u2019s response capacity. In addition, the country is highly vulnerable and at risk of natural hazards, which have exacerbated previous humanitarian crises.The overall risk assessed for this outbreak is very high at the national level, due to the following reasons:The current socio-economic situation, ongoing humanitarian crisis and poor health conditions are affecting a large proportion of the population leaving them vulnerable to the risk of cholera infection and recurrence of cholera. \u00a0In the affected areas of Port-au-Prince metropolitan area and southern departments, there are 24 200 internally displaced people\u00a0who have been displaced due to gang violence.Limited access of the general population to safe drinking water and to sanitation facilities.Due to the insecurity, the public health system and international partners have limited human resources in Haiti, reducing the capacity to respond.Logistics issues and lack of access to fuel and insecurity lead to difficulties to import supplies and challenges to access the affected areas. Therefore, timely assessment of the epidemiological situation is complex. Additionally, for the same reasons the shipment of biological samples from healthcare facilities to reference laboratories could also be hampered.The risk at the regional level is assessed as moderate, due to the following reasons:Since 2010, confirmed cases of cholera have predominantly been reported from Haiti, followed by the Dominican Republic, Cuba, and Mexico. Sporadic imported cases have also been reported in other countries in the Region. However, there is greater capacity in other countries to detect and control outbreaks of cholera. Neighboring Dominican Republic which is likely the most at risk of an increase in cases, has the capacity to detect and control cholera.The risk at the global level was assessed as low.WHO will continue to evaluate the epidemiological situation in Haiti.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO recommends improving access to proper and timely case management of cholera cases, improving access to safe drinking water and sanitation infrastructure, as well as improving infection, prevention, and control in healthcare facilities. These measures along with the promotion of preventive hygiene practices and food safety in affected communities are the most effective means of controlling cholera. Targeted public health communication messages are a key element for a successful campaign.Oral cholera vaccine (OCV) should be used in conjunction with improvements in water and sanitation to control cholera outbreaks and for prevention in targeted areas known to be at high risk for cholera. Given the re-emergence of cholera in Haiti, WHO recommends that Member States strengthen and maintain surveillance for cholera for the early detection of suspected cases and to provide adequate treatment and prevent its spread. Early and adequate treatment limits the case fatality ratio (CFR) of hospitalized patients to less than 1%.WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions on Haiti based on the currently available information.",

        "Description of the Situation": "Between January and 28 September 2022, a total of 28 109 suspected and confirmed cases of dengue fever including 38 confirmed deaths (overall CFR 0.13%) have been reported from all seven provinces of Nepal, affecting all 77 districts in Nepal (Figure 1). Bagmati province which is the second-most populous province has reported the highest number of cases (78.2%) and deaths (68.4%).According to the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division (EDCD) of the Ministry of Health and Population, the highest number of new cases in 2022 have been reported in the districts of Kathmandu (n=9528; 33.8%), Lalitpur (n=6548; 23.2%), and Makwanpur (n=2776, 9.8%).Data on demographics was available for 23% of cases (n= 6734) of which 76% (5175/6734) were aged 15-59 years old, and 54% were males (n=3637). As of 28 September, 38 deaths have been verified, of which males and cases aged 15 \u2013 59 years old each accounted for 55% (n=21) of reported deaths. Cases aged over 60 years old accounted for 39% (n=15) of reported deaths.Dengue cases have increased since July coinciding with the rainy season with majority of the cases reported during September (83.6%; n=23 514).Figure 1. \u00a0Number of Dengue cases reported from districts of Nepal from 1 January- 28 September 2022. Figure 2. \u00a0\u00a0Number of dengue cases reported by months in Nepal from 1 January to 28 September 2022",
        "Epidemiology": "Dengue is a viral infection transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes and is found in tropical and sub-tropical climates worldwide, mostly in urban and semi-urban areas. The primary vectors that transmit the disease are\u00a0Aedes aegypti\u00a0mosquitoes and, to a lesser extent,\u00a0Aedes albopictus.Dengue virus (DENV) has four serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4) and it is possible to be infected by each. Infection with one serotype provides long-term immunity to the homologous serotype but not to the other serotypes; sequential infections put people at greater risk for severe dengue. Many DENV infections produce only mild illness; over 80% of cases are asymptomatic. DENV can cause an acute flu-like illness.There is no specific treatment for dengue; however, timely detection of cases, identifying any warning signs of severe dengue infection, and appropriate case management are key elements of care to prevent patient death and can lower fatality rates of severe infection to below 1%.",
        "Public Health Response": "The Epidemiology and Diseases Control Division of the Ministry of Health and Population initiated the following actions to manage and coordinate the response:Overall response: The Ministry of Health and Population (MoHP) together with WHO and hospitals convened a meeting to review the preparedness and map out strategic interventions for the dengue outbreak in the country. Virtual meetings have been conducted with provinces, districts, and local levels of the MoHP to review the current epidemiology and the responses required. WHO drafted the multisectoral engagement plan to accelerate the Dengue Response and submitted it to the EDCD for review and implementation of action plans.Vector Control measures: WHO assisted in the development of a standard operating procedure for vector control activities. Technical working group meetings have been convened to facilitate dengue response and to strengthen vector surveillance activities in high-risk/high-case reporting districts in Kathmandu valley (which is in Bagmati province) and Lumbini province). Search and destroy campaigns for mosquitoes in municipalities including Lalitpur and Kathmandu (prioritizing main breeding containers) have been initiated. Vector surveillance and sample collection in high-case reporting districts in Kathmandu have been initiated. Laboratory: A total of 39 000 diagnostic kits have been provided through WHO and Government funding. \u00a0WHO facilitated sample collection for serotyping from ten identified hospitals nation wise in collaboration with EDCD and National Public Health Laboratory (NPHL).Clinical Management: A total of 200 physicians and medical officers were trained in September, in the case management of dengue fever, referral of dengue patients, and reporting for the dengue surveillance system. \u00a0This included in-person attendance of 70 healthcare workers (HCWs) from major hospitals in Kathmandu Valley and an additional 130 HCWs from all Provinces who joined virtually. The video recording of the orientation has been disseminated by EDCD for its wider use.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Nepal reported its first dengue case in a traveller returning from India in 2004. Since then, dengue has been endemic in Nepal. The country has expertise and experience in managing dengue, however, WHO considers the overall risk for the current dengue outbreak high at the national level due to the following reasons: As dengue is recurrent in the country, the population may be at risk of re-infection and therefore,\u00a0serious complications may occur if not managed promptly and correctly.\u00a0 At present, severe dengue cases and case-fatality rates appear to be increasing, likely due to the limited hospital capacity in-country and limited access to and use of health care services. With the current increase in other vector-borne diseases in Nepal this year, such as Japanese Encephalitis and Scrub typhus, affecting\u00a0the national health system capacity, there is a high risk of serious health impacts from dengue fever. Dengue virus has the potential to cause epidemics resulting in high morbidity and mortality.\u00a0 There is no specific treatment. Early recognition of dengue virus infection and appropriate clinical management can reduce the severity of disease and mortality among dengue patients.The current circulating serotype is unknown at this stage, although further laboratory tests are planned. Infection with one serotype provides long-term immunity to the homologous serotype, however, the risk for severe dengue is high in a second infection with a different DENV serotype.Current data suggests that dengue cases are increasing in magnitude and expanding out of the lowland areas typically suitable for the breeding of Aedes mosquitoes to higher elevations, potentially due to climate changes and rapid urbanization.This outbreak underscores the need for improved vector surveillance, enhanced laboratory capacity for better case detection, and improved\u00a0surveillance of acute febrile illness in Nepal to effectively control the outbreak.\u00a0There is frequent population movement across the Nepal-India land border. Dengue is endemic in many parts of India including northern Indian States, which share the border with Nepal.\u00a0 Given the high incidence in Nepal, it is possible that dengue may spread across the border into India, although its consequences may depend on a number of factors such as the density of vectors, circulating serotypes, and level of public health response in the neighbouring Indian states. Nepal is a popular tourist destination, hence, spread through international travellers cannot be ruled out as Nepal is easing international travel restrictions imposed in response to COVID-19.",
        "WHO Advice": "The proximity of mosquito vector breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for dengue virus infection.\u00a0 Although dengue does not spread from human to human, mosquitoes can become infected after biting infected individuals. This cycle, therefore, makes the infected mosquito capable of spreading the dengue virus among households and in the neighbourhood, leading to clusters of cases.The prevention and control of dengue depend on effective vector control. WHO promotes a strategic approach known as Integrated Vector Management (IVM) to control mosquito vectors, including Aedes subspecies (the vector of dengue). IVM should be enhanced to remove potential breeding sites, reduce vector populations, and minimize individual exposure. This should involve vector control strategies for larvae and adults (i.e., environmental management and source reduction, and chemical control measures), as well as strategies for protecting people and households. Vector control activities should focus on all areas where there is a risk of human-vector contact (place of residence, workplaces, schools and hospitals, and construction sites in Kathmandu Valley). Vector control activities can include covering, draining, and cleaning household water storage containers on a weekly basis. Space spraying with insecticide can be deployed as an emergency measure. Chlorination and application of suitable larvicides/insecticides for water storage in outdoor containers should also be considered.Personal protective measures during outdoor activities include the application of repellents to exposed skin or clothing, and the wearing of long sleeves shirts and trousers. Indoors, additionally, protection can include the use of household insecticide aerosol products or mosquito coils. Window and door screens, as well as air conditioning, can reduce the probability of mosquitoes entering the house. Insecticide-treated nets offer good protection to people against mosquito bites while sleeping during the day. Since Aedes mosquitoes are active at dawn and dusk, personal protective measures are recommended particularly at these times of the day.There is no specific treatment for dengue infection, but early detection of warning signs and timely access to appropriate clinical management (including referral to an appropriate health care facility) reduce the risk for severe dengue complications and mortality. Vector and human case surveillance should continue to be enhanced in all affected areas and across the country. Where feasible, resources should be allocated for the strengthening of a sample referral mechanism for the confirmation and sub-typing of dengue virus.WHO does not recommend that any general travel or trade restrictions be applied to Nepal based on the information available for this event.",

        "Date Reported": "29 September 2022",
        "Location": "Democratic Republic of the Congo",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 27 September 2022, the Ministry of Health (MoH) of the Democratic Republic of the Congo declared the end of the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak that affected Butanuka health area, Beni health zone, North Kivu province. In accordance with WHO recommendations, the declaration was made 42 days (twice the maximum incubation period for Ebola virus infections) after the burial of the last and only confirmed case.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 21 August 2022, the MoH of the Democratic Republic of the Congo declared an Ebola outbreak following laboratory confirmation via reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of Ebola virus in a fatal case in Beni health zone, North Kivu province.The case was a 46-year-old woman hospitalized and treated from 23 July to 15 August (23 days) for symptoms that included cough, headache, polyarthralgia (joint pain), and physical asthenia (general fatigue), thought to be related to her known co-morbidities. The patient died in hospital on 15 August 2022. The body was returned to the family and buried in a traditional manner on 16 August prior to receipt of the laboratory results.Samples of blood and oropharyngeal secretions tested positive for Zaire ebolavirus by RT-PCR at the National Institute for Biomedical Research in Beni (INRB) on 15 August and these were confirmed at Rodolphe M\u00e9rieux INRB Laboratory in Goma on 16 August. The outbreak was declared by the MoH following EVD confirmation testing and genetic sequencing.No additional confirmed or probable cases have been identified since 16 August. Of the 182 contacts of the case, 172 were identified and monitored for 21 days. The 10 contacts who were not followed up were unable to be reached.Investigations are still ongoing to determine the source of the outbreak.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "Overall response:\u00a0The MoH, together with WHO and other partners, conducted response measures to control the outbreak and prevent further spread. National and district emergency management committees were activated to coordinate the response. Multidisciplinary teams were deployed to actively search and provide care for cases; identify, reach and follow-up contacts; and sensitize communities on outbreak prevention and control interventions.Alerts and testing: During this outbreak, from 21 August to 27 September 2022, a total of 9173 alerts were reported from Beni health zone, and all (100%) were investigated, including 607 (7%) validated as suspected cases of EVD. A total of 682 samples were tested for EVD.Points of entry: A total of 2390 (92%) of 2608 travelers registered at points of entry were screened for EVD, and no alerts were detected.Vaccination: As of 27 September, 550 persons in the affected health zone have been vaccinated against EVD using the ring strategy, targeting contacts and contacts of contact. Frontline health care workers made up the majority of those vaccinated (483).",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "This latest EVD outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is declared over, with no new cases reported for 42 days after the burial of the last and only confirmed case on 16 August 2022. This case is genetically linked to the 2018-2020 outbreak in North Kivu, Ituri and South Kivu provinces. (For more information on this outbreak, please see the WHO outbreak account related to the 2018-2020 event). The source of this most recent outbreak has not yet been identified.A future outbreak is not unexpected given that EVD is endemic in the country. Ebola virus is enzootic and a resurgence from viral persistence in survivors described in recent epidemics. Re-emergence of EVD is a major public health concern in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; gaps remain in the country's capacity to recover, prepare for, and respond to outbreaks. The concurrent outbreaks in the country (COVID-19, cholera, measles, polio, yellow fever, monkeypox, etc) as well as the protracted humanitarian situation in the Eastern part of the country have put increasing pressure on the health system and the available resources.A confluence of environmental and socioeconomic factors \u2014 including community mistrust, weak health systems, and political instability \u2014 in some specific areas such as North Kivu province can increase the risk for new outbreaks of EVD. Moreover, improved capacities in detection, laboratory confirmation and increased surveillance may explain the increased frequency in detecting EVD outbreaks. Nevertheless, WHO is concerned that ongoing challenges regarding insecurity as well as health system challenges (epidemiological surveillance, IPC programmes and practices in health care settings), coupled with the emergence of COVID-19 and other ongoing outbreaks, may jeopardize the country's ability to rapidly detect and respond to any re-emergence.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO advises the following risk reduction measures as an effective way to reduce EVD transmission in humans:Reduce the risk of wildlife-to-human transmission from contact with infected fruit bats or non-human primates and the consumption of their raw meat. Animals should be handled with gloves and other appropriate protective clothing.Reduce the risk of human-to-human transmission from direct or close contact with people with Ebola symptoms, particularly with their bodily fluids. Appropriate personal protective equipment should be worn when taking care of ill patients. Regular hand washing is required after visiting patients in hospital, as well as after touching or coming into contact with any body fluids.Continue training and retraining of health personnel for early detection, isolation and treatment of EVD cases as well as retraining on safe and dignified burials.Reduce the risk of possible transmission from virus persistence in some body fluids of survivors. WHO recommends providing medical care, psychological support and biological testing (until two consecutive negative tests) through an EVD survivors care programme. WHO does not recommend isolation of male or female convalescent patients whose blood has been tested negative for the Ebola virus.Reduce amplification of transmission through health care by strengthening IPC programmes within the health care system.Provide ongoing training of the health workforce for early detection, isolation, and treatment of EVD cases as well as re-training on safe and dignified burials and the IPC ring approach.Engage with communities to reinforce safe and dignified burial practices.Build and maintain capacities for logistic support in at-risk areas or countries.Based on the\u00a0current risk assessment and prior evidence on Ebola outbreaks, WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.",

        "Date Reported": "26 September 2022",
        "Location": "Ghana",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 16 September 2022, the Ministry of Health (MoH) of Ghana declared the end of the Marburg Virus Disease (MVD) outbreak that affected the country\u2019s Ashanti, Savannah and Western regions. In accordance with WHO recommendations the declaration was made 42 days (twice the maximum incubation period for Marburg infection) after the second negative test of the last confirmed case on 5 August 2022.",
        "Description of the Situation": "Between 28 June and 16 September 2022, the Ministry of Health of Ghana reported three confirmed cases of Marburg Virus Disease (MVD) including two deaths (CFR 67%). All three cases were from the same household.The Ministry of Health of Ghana declared the outbreak on 7 July 2022, after confirmation of Marburg virus on 1 July 2022 in a 26-year-old male (the index case) by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research (NMIMR). Blood samples were sent to Institute Pasteur, Dakar for confirmation. The onset of his symptoms was the 22 June with subsequent bleeding from the nose and mouth. The patient was admitted to a hospital on 26 June 2022 and died the following day.The second patient, a 14-month-old child, developed symptoms and was admitted on 17 July; he died on the third day of admission. The third patient, a 24-year-old female was admitted to a government-designated isolation center on 26 July 2022. \u00a0\u00a0A total of 198 contacts were identified, monitored, and completed their recommended initial 21-day observation period which was then extended for another 21 days by the health authorities.On 16 September 2022, the MoH declared the end of the outbreak, 42 days (twice the maximum incubation period) after the second negative test of the last confirmed case on 5 August 2022.",
        "Epidemiology": "Marburg Virus Disease (MVD) is an epidemic-prone disease associated with high case fatality ratios (CFR; 24-88%). In the early course of the disease, the clinical diagnosis of MVD is difficult to distinguish from many other tropical febrile illnesses due to the similarities in the clinical symptoms. Other VHFs need to be excluded, including Ebola virus disease, as well as malaria, typhoid fever, leptospirosis, rickettsial infections, and plague. Human MVD infection can result from prolonged exposure to mines or caves inhabited by Rousettus bat colonies. Marburg virus spreads through human-to-human transmission via direct contact (through broken skin or mucous membranes) with infected people's blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids, and surfaces and materials (e.g. bedding, clothing) contaminated with these fluids.Although no vaccines or antiviral treatments are approved to treat the virus, supportive care \u2013 rehydration with oral or intravenous fluids \u2013 and treatment of specific symptoms improve survival. A range of potential treatments are being evaluated, including blood products, immune therapies, and drug therapies.In 2021,\u00a0an outbreak of MVD was reported for the first time in West Africa in Guinea. Genetic sequencing results indicated that the Marburg virus (MARV) genomes from Ghana are related to the sequence from the 2021 outbreak and overall, group with sequences obtained from bats in Sierra Leone and an outbreak that occurred in Angola in 2004-2005.",
        "Public Health Response": "Overall Response: The MoH established a national coordination mechanism and response activities were initiated by WHO and other key partners, US Center for Disease Control, UNICEF and United Kingdom, Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO). Technical experts were deployed by WHO to support the country in strengthening Infection Prevention and Control (IPC), coordination, surveillance, and to conduct investigations and risk assessment.Surveillance and Contract Tracing: An integrated disease surveillance and response (IDSR) system was in place and reported alerts were tested. Surveillance activities were implemented including epidemiological investigation and 198 contacts were followed up.Infection Prevention and Control: Health care workers were sensitized on case definition and infection prevention.Laboratory: Samples of all suspected cases were tested at the laboratory of NMIMR. Genomic sequencing was performed on samples from two of the confirmed cases at NMIMR and IPD.Community Engagement: Orientation was held for community-based surveillance volunteers to enhance surveillance in the community.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "The current outbreak of MVD in Ghana has been declared over, with no new cases reported for 42-days after the second negative test of the last confirmed case on 5 August 2022. This was the first MVD outbreak reported in Ghana. Outbreaks of MVD are not frequent in West Africa. The most recent MVD outbreak was reported in the Republic of Guinea (one confirmed case) in August 2021. Countries in the African Region that have previously reported outbreaks of MVD include Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, South Africa, and Uganda. \u00a0The epidemiological investigation has not yet identified the source of this outbreak, which highlights the need to intensify community-based surveillance.\u00a0The risk of this outbreak at its onset was assessed high at the national level, moderate at the regional level, and low at the global level.",
        "WHO Advice": "Human-to-human transmission of Marburg virus is primarily associated with direct contact with blood and/or bodily fluids of infected persons, and health care related transmission of Marburg virus has been reported when appropriate infection control measures have not been implemented.Infection Prevention and Control at Health Care Facilities: Health care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed Marburg virus disease should apply standard and transmission-based IPC precautions to avoid any exposure to blood and/or bodily fluids, as well as unprotected contact with the possibly contaminated environment. IPC precautions include:Early recognition (screening, triage) and isolation of suspected cases.Appropriate isolation capacity (including infrastructure and human resources).Health care workers\u2019 access to hand hygiene resources (i.e., soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub).Appropriate and accessible PPE for health care workers.Safe injection practices (emphasize on single-use only needles).Procedures and resources for decontamination and sterilization of medical devices.Appropriate management of infectious waste.Integrated disease surveillance and response activities, including community-based surveillance, must continue to be strengthened within all affected health zones.Community Awareness for Infection prevention and control: Raising awareness of the risk factors for Marburg virus disease and the protective measures individuals can take to reduce human exposure to the virus are the key measures to reduce human infections and deaths. Key public health communication messages include:Reducing the risk of human-to-human transmission in the community arising from direct contact with infected patients, particularly with their bodily fluids.Avoiding close physical contact with patients who have Marburg virus disease.Any suspected case should not be managed at home, but immediately transferred to a health facility for treatment and isolation. During this transfer, health care workers should wear appropriate PPE.Regular hand washing should be performed after visiting sick relatives in hospital.Communities affected by Marburg should make efforts to ensure that the population is well informed, both about the nature of the disease itself to avoid further transmission, community stigmatization, and encourage early presentation to treatment centers and other necessary outbreak containment measures, including safe burial of the dead. People who have died from Marburg should be promptly and safely buried.Reduce the risk of wildlife-to-human transmissions, such as through contact with fruit bats, monkeys, and apes:Handle wildlife with gloves and other appropriate protective clothing.Cook animal products such as blood and meat thoroughly before consumption and avoid consumption of raw meat.During work, research activities or tourist visits in mines or caves inhabited by fruit bat colonies, people should wear gloves and other appropriate protective clothing including masks.",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 20 September 2022, Uganda health authorities declared an outbreak of Ebola disease, caused by Sudan virus, following laboratory confirmation of a patient from a village in Madudu sub-county, Mubende district, central Uganda.\nAs of 25 September 2022, a cumulative number of 18 confirmed and 18 probable cases have been reported from Mubende, Kyegegwa and Kassanda districts, including 23 deaths, of which five were among confirmed cases (CFR among confirmed cases 28%). This is the first Ebola disease outbreak caused by Sudan virus (SUDV) in Uganda since 2012.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 20 September 2022, the health authorities in Uganda declared an outbreak of Ebola disease caused by Sudan virus (SUDV), after a case was confirmed in a village of Madudu sub-county in Mubende district, central Uganda.The case was a 24-year-old male who developed a wide range of symptoms on 11 September including high-grade fever, tonic convulsions, blood-stained vomit and diarrhoea, loss of appetite, pain while swallowing, chest pain, dry cough and bleeding in the\neyes. He visited two private clinics, successively between 11-13 and 13-15 September without improvement. He was then referred to the Regional Referral Hospital (RRH) on 15 September where he was isolated as a suspected case of viral haemorrhagic\nfever. A blood sample was collected on 17 September and sent to the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) in Kampala where RT- PCR tests conducted were positive for SUDV on 19 September. On the same day, the patient died.Results of preliminary investigations identified a number of community deaths from an unknown illness in Madudu and Kiruma sub-counties of Mubende district reported in the first two weeks of September. These deaths are now considered to be probable cases\nof Ebola caused by SUDV.As of 25 September 2022, a cumulative number of 36 cases (18 confirmed and 18 probable cases) have been reported from Mubende (14 confirmed and 18 probable), Kyegegwa (three confirmed cases) and Kassanda (one confirmed case) districts. Twenty-three deaths\nhave been recorded, of which five were among confirmed cases (CFR among confirmed cases 28%). Of the total confirmed and suspected cases, 62% are female and 38% are male. There are currently 13 confirmed cases hospitalized. The median age of the cases\nis 26 years (range 1 year to 60 years). A cumulative number of 223 contacts have been listed.Map of confirmed (n=18) and suspected (n=18) cases of Ebola disease caused by Sudan virus, by district, Uganda (as of 25 September 2022).",
        "Epidemiology": "According to the International Classification of Disease for filoviruses (ICD-11) released in May 2019, Ebola disease is now sub-categorized depending on the causative virus. Outbreaks of Ebola disease caused by Sudan virus are named Sudan Virus Disease (SVD) outbreaks. Prior to May 2019 all viruses causing Ebola disease were grouped together. Based on the results of laboratory tests, this outbreak is caused by Sudan virus.Sudan virus disease is a severe, often fatal illness affecting humans. Sudan virus was first reported in southern Sudan in June 1976, since then the virus has emerged periodically and up to now, seven outbreaks caused by SUDV have been reported, four in Uganda and three in Sudan. The estimated case fatality ratios of SVD have varied from 41% to 100% in past outbreaks.The virus is introduced into the human population through close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals such as fruit bats, chimpanzees, gorillas, monkeys, forest antelope or porcupines found ill or dead or in the rainforest. The virus then spreads through human-to-human transmission via direct contact (through broken skin or mucous membranes) with either blood or body fluids of a person who is sick with or has died from SVD or objects that have been contaminated with body fluids (like blood, faeces, vomit) from a person sick with SVD or the body of a person who died from SVD.The incubation period ranges from 2 to 21 days. People infected with Sudan virus cannot spread the disease until they develop symptoms, and they remain infectious as long as their blood contains the virus. Symptoms of SVD can be sudden and include fever, fatigue, muscle pain, headache, and sore throat later followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, symptoms of impaired kidney and liver function. In some cases, the patient might present both internal and external bleeding (for example, bleeding from the gums, or blood in the stools).The diagnosis of SVD can be difficult, as early nonspecific manifestation of the disease may mimic other infectious diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever and meningitis. Confirmation is made using numerous diagnostic methods including RT-PCR. Supportive care - rehydration with oral or intravenous fluids - and treatment of specific symptoms improve survival.There are no licensed vaccines or therapeutics for the prevention and treatment of Sudan virus disease.Uganda has reported four SVD outbreaks, in 2000, 2011 and 2012 (two outbreaks). Uganda also reported a Bundibugyo virus disease outbreak in 2007 and an Ebola virus disease outbreak in 2019.",
        "Public Health Response": "CoordinationThe Ministry of Health (MOH) established a National Task Force, with WHO providing technical support The Incidence Management Team was activated both within the MOH and the WHO country officeThe MOH Incident Commander has been deployed to Mubende District to support response efforts in the affected regionWHO is supporting the orientation of the leadership at the Regional Referral Hospital and the district health team on early identification and case managementA response plan is being developed and priority actions have been identifiedSurveillance and LaboratoryWHO has supported the activation of surveillance structures in districtsContact tracing and active case finding are ongoing WHO has deployed a technical team in Mubende district to support surveillanceCase ManagementWHO has supported the assessment of the isolation unit at the regional referral Hospital and dispatched an Ebola disease kit and tent for the isolation of patientsWHO has deployed a central team of experts to support the establishment of a treatment unit in the Regional Referral HospitalInfection prevention and control (IPC) teams were deployed to support capacity building of health workers in IPC and the establishment of screening and triage at all health facilities in affected districtsCommunication and Risk CommunicationAs part of the communication and risk communication activities, WHO provided technical support for the organization of the press conference on Ebola and the development and dissemination of a press statement by the Ministry of HealthCurrently, WHO is supporting the review of Information, Education and Communication (IEC) material for dissemination to the public",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Uganda has experience in responding to Ebola virus disease and Sudan virus disease outbreaks, and necessary action has been initiated quickly. The current outbreak is the first Ebola disease outbreak caused by Sudan virus in Uganda since 2012.\u00a0 In the absence of licensed vaccines and therapeutics for prevention and treatment of Sudan virus disease, the risk of potential serious public health impact is high. Community deaths and care of patients in private facilities and hospitals and other community health services with limited protection and infection prevention and control measures entail a high risk of many transmission chains. Investigations are ongoing to determine the scope of the outbreak and the possibility of spreading to other districts. Importation of cases to neighbouring countries cannot be ruled out at this stage.According to the information currently available, the overall risk has been assessed as high at national level considering: (i) the confirmed Sudan virus and the lack of an authorized vaccine (ii) the possibility that the event started three weeks before the identification of the index case and several transmission chains \u00a0have not been \u00a0not tracked; (iii) patients presented at various facilities with suboptimal infection, prevention and control (IPC) practices including inadequate use of personal protective equipment (PPE); the patients died and were traditionally buried with large gathering ceremonies; (iv) although the country has developed an increased capacity to respond to Ebola outbreaks over recent years, and has a local capacity that can be easily mobilized and organised with\u00a0 available resources to mount a robust response, the system could be overwhelmed if\u00a0 the number of cases increases and the outbreak spreads to other sub-counties, districts and regions, as the country simultaneously responds to multiple\u00a0 emergencies, including anthrax, COVID-19, Rift Valley fever and Yellow fever, as well as flooding and prevailing food insecurity.In addition, the outbreak was detected among individuals living around an active local gold mine. Mobility among traders of this commodity is likely to be high, and the declaration of the outbreak may cause some miners already incubating the disease to flee.The currently affected Mubende district has no international borders. Nevertheless, the risk of international spread cannot be ruled out due to the active cross-border population movement. In addition, investigations are ongoing to establish transmission chains and the scope of the outbreak is yet to be determined.At Regional and Global levels, the overall risk has been assessed as low.",
        "WHO Advice": "Effective outbreak control relies on applying a package of interventions, including case management, surveillance and contact tracing, an optimal laboratory service, implementation of infection prevention and control measures in health care and community settings, safe and dignified burials and community engagement and social mobilization. Community engagement is essential to successfully controlling outbreaks. Raising awareness of risk factors for Ebola infection and protective measures that individuals can take is an effective way to reduce human transmission. Early initiation of supportive treatment has been shown to significantly reduce deaths from Ebola disease. There is a need to strengthen surveillance and other response activities to contain the possibility of exponential spread. Based on available evidence the ERVEBO vaccine \u2014 used in the recent responses against the Ebola virus disease outbreaks \u2014 will not provide cross-protection against the Sudan virus disease.The Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) vaccine called Zabdeno/Mvabea against Ebola has only been approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) against Ebola virus disease and has not been tested against Sudan virus disease. This vaccine is administered on a two-dose schedule and requires 56 days between the two doses. The first dose provides protection against the Zaire ebolavirus and the second dose was designed to provide protection against other species of the virus, including Sudan. However, this multiantigen protection has not been demonstrated with clinical data.\u00a0 Even if the vaccine was tested and proved to be effective against Sudan ebolavirus, it would only provide protection some days after the second dose is administered. This means the vaccine is not appropriate for outbreak response. WHO advises against any restrictions on travel and/or trade to Uganda based on available information for the current outbreak.",

        "Description of the Situation": "In the past few months, there have been several genetically linked Sabin-like type 2 poliovirus (SL2) detections from environmental samples in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (hereafter the United Kingdom) and the United States of America.\u00a0\u00a0In the United Kingdom, since February 2022, the WHO Global Polio Laboratory Network (GPLN) located at the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC) in London has consistently detected Sabin-like type 2 poliovirus isolates in sewage samples collected from London. Samples collected on 24 and 31 May had sufficient mutations to qualify as vaccine derived polio virus type 2 (VDPV2). Subsequently, due to a new detection of the virus more than two months later, these samples were classified as \u2018circulating\u2019 VDPV2 on 8 August.\u00a0 As of 5 September, no human case associated with VDPV2 has been reported in the United Kingdom.\u00a0\u00a0In the United States of America, Sabin-like type 2 poliovirus has been consistently detected in environmental samples collected between 21 April to 26 August 2022 from Rockland County, New York State, and nearby counties. In late July, a case of VDPV2 was reported in an unvaccinated individual in Rockland County, who presented with paralysis. The case had no recent history of international travel. This is the first case of poliomyelitis reported in the country since 2013. Due to detection of environmental viral sequences (collected on 3 August and 11 August) containing more than five nucleotide changes, and both linked to the case reported in Rockland County \u2013 these viruses are now being classified as \u2018circulating\u2019 VDPV2.\u00a0 \u00a0The virus detected in environmental samples in New York State, United States of America is genetically linked to viruses detected in sewage samples from London, United Kingdom and in sewage samples collected between January to June 2022 from Jerusalem District, Israel1.\u00a0 \u00a0Figure-1 Detection of genetically linked cVDPV2 isolates in the United Kingdom and the United States of America from February to August 2022",
        "Epidemiology": "Polio is a highly infectious disease that largely affects children under five years of age, causing permanent paralysis (approximately 1 in 200 infections) or death (5-10% of those paralyzed).\u00a0\u00a0The virus is transmitted from person-to-person, mainly through the fecal-oral route or, less frequently, by a common vehicle (e.g., contaminated water or food) and multiplies in the intestine, from where it can invade the nervous system and cause paralysis and death. Initial symptoms of polio include fever, fatigue, headache, vomiting, stiffness of the neck and pain in the limbs. In a small proportion of cases, the disease causes paralysis, which is often permanent. There is no cure for polio but it can be prevented by immunization.\u00a0The incubation period is usually 7\u201310 days but can range from 4\u201335 days. Up to 90% of those infected are either asymptomatic or experience only mild symptoms and the disease often goes unrecognized.\u00a0Vaccine-derived poliovirus is a well-documented type of poliovirus that has mutated from the strain originally contained in the oral polio vaccine (OPV). The OPV contains a live, weakened form of poliovirus. On rare occasions, when replicating in the gastrointestinal tract, OPV strains genetically change and may spread in communities that are not fully vaccinated against polio, especially in areas where there is poor hygiene, poor sanitation, or overcrowding. Further changes occur as these viruses spread from person to person. The lower the population immunity, the longer this virus survives and the more genetic changes it undergoes. In very rare instances, the vaccine-derived virus can genetically change into a form that can paralyze \u2013 this is what is known as a vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV).\u00a0The detection of VDPV in at least two different sources and at least two months apart, that are genetically linked, showing evidence of transmission in the community, should be classified as \u2018circulating\u2019 vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2).\u00a0 cVDPV2 continues to affect different areas of the world.",
        "Public Health Response": "WHO, in coordination with national authorities, will continue to evaluate the genetic and epidemiological situation to determine the possible spread of the virus and the potential risk associated with these isolates detected from different locations around the world.\u00a0\u00a0Public health measures in the United Kingdom The United Kingdom Health Security Agency (UKHSA) is conducting further investigations including assessing the public health risk and implementing response measures. These measures include:\u00a0Strengthening the environmental, clinical and laboratory surveillance for polio.\u00a0\u00a0A catch-up campaign targeted at children aged less than 5 years of age in London was implemented in June 2022, and a supplementary booster inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) campaign targeting children aged 1 to 9 years in London was launched in August 2022.\u00a0Public health professionals, health professionals, and laboratory staff alerted to the detection of VDPV2 in London.\u00a0Health professionals reminded of the importance of checking newly registered children and adult routine immunizations are up-to-date, with an emphasis on under-immunized populations (new migrants, asylum seekers and refugees).\u00a0Local and regional laboratories requested to refer all enterovirus positive stool samples to the UKHSA.\u00a0Enhancing environmental sampling to assess the extent of the spread of the virus across London. In addition, a range of additional sewage sampling sites are being stood up across the country.Public health measures in the United States of America\u00a0Enhancing polio wastewater surveillance.\u00a0Ongoing activities to support polio vaccination and increase vaccination coverage in Rockland and Orange Counties in New York State. Planning underway to launch an immunization campaign to provide IPV to residents of Rockland County who have potentially been exposed to poliovirus.\u00a0Conducting testing for poliovirus in wastewater samples in New York and neighbouring States, as well as providing confirmatory testing for clinical specimens.\u00a0Coordinating surveillance for Acute Flaccid Myelitis (AFM) throughout the United States of America and enhancing surveillance for paralytic and non-paralytic polio in areas where poliovirus has been detected in wastewater.\u00a0Health advisories including information on polio, the situation in New York State, and polio immunization, have been released to health providers and hospitals across the State and in the immediate county of residence of the case.\u00a0On 9 September, a state disaster emergency due to polio was declared in New York State. The declaration allows additional health professionals, such as pharmacists, to administer polio vaccine and allows health practitioners to issue standing orders for polio vaccinations.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "The emergence of cVDPV2 in the United Kingdom and in the United States of America is a reminder that until polio is eradicated, polio-free countries will remain at risk of polio re-infection or re-emergence. The detection of this VDPV2 strain underscores the importance of;\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 maintaining high levels of routine polio vaccination coverage at all levels and in all communities to minimize the risk and consequences of any poliovirus circulation.\u00a0\u2022 having sensitive surveillance systems for the timely detection of VDPV importation or VDPV emergence.\u00a0Based on the WHO UNICEF estimates, the vaccine coverage for three routine doses of polio vaccine evaluated in children aged 12 months in the United Kingdom and United States of America were 93% and 92% respectively in 2021.WHO will continue to support the ongoing investigation, risk assessment and outbreak response by national authorities.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO reiterates to all Member States the importance of reaching and maintaining polio vaccination coverage of more than 95% in each district or municipality; maintaining high quality for three main surveillance indicators: acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) rate, percentage of cases investigated within 48 hours, and percentage of cases with an adequate sample; optimizing supplementary (environmental and enterovirus) poliovirus surveillance and updating national poliovirus outbreak response plans in order to rapidly detect and respond to new virus importations or VDPV emergence to minimize the consequences of poliovirus transmission and facilitate a rapid response. The thirty-second polio IHR Emergency Committee meeting held in June 2022, convened under the International Health Regulations (2005), agreed that the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and recommended the extension of Temporary Recommendations for a further three months.",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 11 May 2022, Germany\u202fnotified WHO of one laboratory-confirmed human case of infection with a swine-origin influenza A(H1N1) virus\u202fin North Rhine-Westphalia, in the west of Germany. The case was detected during routine sentinel surveillance for influenza. No further cases have been reported in connection to this case and the patient has fully recovered. Although infections with A(H1N1) variant viruses occasionally occur, it is still considered a rare and unusual event.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 11 May 2022, Germany notified WHO of one laboratory-confirmed human case of infection with a swine-origin influenza A(H1N1) virus in North Rhine-Westphalia state, Germany. The case is an adult aged 30-40 years, who was detected during routine sentinel surveillance for influenza. On 21 March, the case developed influenza-like illness symptoms including fever, cough, sore throat, headache and muscle pain. On 24 March, a nasal swab sample was collected, and on 29 March, influenza A virus was detected.\u00a0\u00a0The sample was tested at the National Influenza Centre at the Robert Koch Institute in Germany. Influenza A virus was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). On 5 May, whole genome sequencing pointed to a Eurasian avian-like swine A(H1N1) virus. Further virus characterization is underway.\u00a0The case was not hospitalized and has since recovered. Although the case had no direct contact with swine, the individual lived in a region with many swine farms and had contacts who were swine farmers.",
        "Epidemiology": "Influenza A(H1) viruses are enzootic in swine populations in most regions of the world. Human cases of infection with swine influenza viruses have sporadically been detected in several countries in Europe in recent years, of whom most had reported exposure to swine.\u00a0 Influenza A viruses in swine do not usually infect humans because influenza viruses that infect pigs may be different from human influenza viruses. Thus, influenza vaccines made against human influenza viruses are generally not expected to protect people from influenza viruses that normally circulate in pigs. When an influenza virus that normally circulates in swine is detected in a person, it is called a \u201cvariant influenza virus\u201d. Sporadic human infections with variant viruses have been reported, usually after direct or indirect exposure to pigs or contaminated environments. Human infections with variant viruses tend to result in mild clinical illness, although some cases have been hospitalized with more severe disease and some have been fatal.\u00a0\u00a0There have been several influenza A(H1) virus infections detected in Europe in recent years. Although infections with A(H1N1) variant virus occasionally occur, it is still considered a rare and unusual event.",
        "Public Health Response": "The German health authorities contacted family members of the case and offered serological tests to close contacts, including a circle of friends who are in the farming community. Authorities are also conducting retrospective epidemiological investigation. No other measures were implemented by the German authorities because the case has recovered and there is currently no evidence of ongoing transmission.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Based on currently available information, this is a sporadic case and there is no evidence of disease spread so far. WHO assesses the risk to the general population posed by this virus to be low and the risk to occupationally exposed persons to be low-to-moderate. As the investigations are still being conducted by the national authority, the risk level will be amended accordingly if warranted.\u00a0Pigs are susceptible to avian, human and swine influenza viruses; they potentially may be infected with influenza viruses from different species at the same time. If this happens, it is possible for the genes of these viruses to mix and create a new virus. This type of major change in the influenza A viruses is known as antigenic shift. If this new virus causes illness in people and can be transmitted easily from person-to-person with no population immunity, an influenza pandemic may occur.\u00a0Should individuals infected with a variant influenza virus travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during travel or after arrival. If this were to occur, further community level spread is considered unlikely as this virus has not acquired the ability to transmit easily among humans.",
        "WHO Advice": "Surveillance:\u00a0\u00a0This case does not change the current WHO recommendations on public health measures and surveillance of seasonal influenza.\u00a0WHO does not advise special traveler screening at points of entry or restrictions with regard to the current situation of influenza viruses at the human-animal interface.\u00a0Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect virological, epidemiological and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health and timely virus sharing for risk assessment.\u00a0Notification and investigation:\u00a0\u00a0All human infections caused by a novel influenza subtype are notifiable under the International Health Regulations (IHR) and State Parties to the IHR (2005) are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic. Evidence of illness is not required.\u00a0In the case of a confirmed or suspected human infection caused by a novel influenza virus with pandemic potential, including a variant virus, a thorough epidemiologic investigation of history of exposure to animals, of travel, and contact tracing should be conducted. The epidemiologic investigation should include early identification of unusual respiratory events that could signal person-to-person transmission of the novel virus. Clinical samples collected from the time and place that the case occurred should be tested and sent to a WHO Collaboration Center for further characterization.\u00a0Travel and trade:\u00a0\u00a0WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel and/or trade for Germany based on the currently available information.\u00a0\u00a0Prevention measures for travelers:\u00a0\u00a0Travelers to countries with known outbreaks of animal influenza should avoid farms, contact with animals in live animal markets, entering areas where animals may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with animal feces. Travelers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travelers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 13 May 2022, WHO was notified of two laboratory confirmed cases and one probable case of monkeypox, from the same household, in the United Kingdom. On 15 May, four additional laboratory confirmed cases have been reported amongst Sexual Health Services attendees presenting with a vesicular rash illness in men who have sex with men (MSM).\nAs response measures, an incident team has been established to coordinate contact tracing efforts.\nIn contrast to sporadic cases with travel links to endemic countries (see Disease outbreak news on Monkeypox in the United Kingdom published on 16 May 2022), no source of infection has been confirmed yet. Based on currently available information, infection seems to have been locally acquired in the United Kingdom. The extent of local transmission is unclear at this stage and there is the possibility of identification of further cases.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 13 May 2022, the United Kingdom notified WHO of two laboratory confirmed cases and one probable case of monkeypox to WHO. All three cases belong to the same family.\u00a0The probable case is epidemiologically linked to the two confirmed cases and has fully recovered. The first case identified (index case) developed a rash on 5 May and was admitted to hospital in London, the United Kingdom on 6 May. On 9 May, the case was transferred to a specialist infectious disease centre for ongoing care. Monkeypox was confirmed on 12 May. Another confirmed case developed a vesicular rash on 30 April, confirmed to have monkeypox on 13 May, and is in a stable condition.\u00a0The West African clade of monkeypox was identified in the two confirmed cases using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR) on vesicle swabs on 12 May and 13 May.\u00a0On 15 May, WHO was notified of four additional laboratory confirmed cases, all identified among MSM attending Sexual Health Services and presenting with a vesicular rash. All four were confirmed to have the West African clade of the monkeypox virus.",
        "Epidemiology": "Monkeypox is a sylvatic zoonosis with incidental human infections that usually occur in forested parts of Central and West Africa. It is caused by the monkeypox virus which belongs to the orthopoxvirus family. Monkeypox can be transmitted by droplet exposure via exhaled large droplets and by contact with infected skin lesions or contaminated materials. The incubation period of monkeypox is usually from 6 to 13 days but can range from 5 to 21 days.\u00a0 The disease is often self-limiting with symptoms usually resolving spontaneously within 14 to 21 days. Symptoms can be mild or severe, and lesions can be very itchy or painful. The animal reservoir remains unknown, although is likely to be among rodents. Contact with live and dead animals through hunting and consumption of wild game or bush meat are known risk factors.There are two clades of monkeypox virus: the West African clade and Congo Basin (Central African) clade. Although the West African clade of monkeypox virus infection sometimes leads to severe illness in some individuals, disease is usually self-limiting. The case fatality ratio for the West African clade has been documented to be around 1%, whereas for the Congo Basin clade, it may be as high as 10%. Children are also at higher risk, and monkeypox during pregnancy may lead to complications, congenital monkeypox or stillbirth.Milder cases of monkeypox may go undetected and represent a risk of person-to-person transmission. There is likely to be little immunity to the infection in those travelling or otherwise exposed, as endemic disease is normally geographically limited to parts of West and Central Africa. Historically, vaccination against smallpox was shown to be protective against monkeypox. While one vaccine (MVA-BN) and one specific treatment (tecovirimat) were approved for monkeypox, in 2019 and 2022 respectively, these countermeasures are not yet widely available, and populations worldwide under the age of 40 or 50 years no longer benefit from the protection afforded by prior smallpox vaccination programmes.",
        "Public Health Response": "Health authorities in the United Kingdom have established an incident management team to coordinate the extensive contact tracing which is currently underway in health care settings and the community for those who have had contact with the confirmed cases. Contacts are being assessed based on their level of exposure and followed up through active or passive surveillance for 21 days from the date of last exposure to a case. Vaccination is being offered to higher risk contacts.A detailed backwards contact tracing investigation is also being carried out to determine the likely route of acquisition and establish whether there are any further chains of transmission within the United Kingdom for all cases. Sexual contacts and venues visited are actively being investigated for the four recent cases.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "No source of infection has yet been confirmed for either the family or MSM clusters. Based on currently available information, infection seems to have been locally acquired in the United Kingdom. The extent of local transmission is unclear at this stage and there is the possibility of identification of further cases. However, once monkeypox was suspected, authorities in the United Kingdom promptly initiated appropriate public health measures, including isolation of the cases and extensive forward and backward contact tracing to enable source identification.In the United Kingdom, there have been eight previous cases of monkeypox reported: all importations were related to a travel history to or from Nigeria. In 2021, there were also two separate human monkeypox cases imported from Nigeria reported by the United States of America. During an outbreak of monkeypox in humans in 2003 in the United States of America, exposure was traced to contact with pet prairie dogs that had been co-housed with monkeypoxvirus-infected small mammals imported from Ghana.",
        "WHO Advice": "Intensive public health measures should continue in the United Kingdom. In addition to the ongoing forward and backward contact tracing and source tracing, case searching, and local rash-illness surveillance should be strengthened in the MSM and wider community, as well as in primary and secondary health care settings. Any patient with suspected monkeypox should be investigated and isolated with supportive care during the presumed and known infectious periods, that is, during the prodromal and rash stages of the illness, respectively. Timely contact tracing, surveillance measures and raising awareness among health care providers, including sexual health and dermatology clinics, are essential for preventing further secondary cases and effective management of the current outbreak. Additionally, deployment of pharmaceutical countermeasures under investigational protocols can be considered.Health workers and other care givers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed monkeypox should implement standard, contact and droplet infection control precautions. Samples taken from people with suspected monkeypox or animals with suspected monkeypox virus infection should be safely handled by trained staff working in suitably equipped laboratories.\u00a0Any illness during travel or upon return from an endemic area should be reported to a health professional, including information about all recent travel and immunization history. Residents and travellers to endemic countries should avoid contact with sick animals (dead or alive) that could harbour monkeypox virus (rodents, marsupials, primates) and should refrain from eating or handling wild game (bush meat). The importance of hand hygiene by using soap and water or alcohol-based sanitizer should be emphasized.International travel or trade: WHO does not recommend any restriction for travel to and trade with the United Kingdom based on available information at this time.WHO continue to closely monitor as the situation is evolving rapidly.",

        "Date Reported": "17 May 2022",
        "Location": "Oman",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 28 April 2022, WHO was notified of a case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), in a 34-year-old male, from Al Dhahira Governorate in Oman. The case had a history of direct contact with animals including dromedaries, sheep and goats at his family farm in Oman. The condition of the case remains critically unstable. As of 28 April, a total of six close community and 27 health care workers had been listed as contacts and were followed for 14 days from the date of last exposure with the case. No secondary cases have been reported to date.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 28 April 2022, the National IHR Focal point of Oman notified WHO of one case of MERS-CoV from Al Dhahira Governorate in Oman.The case, a 34-year-old male, non-health care worker who is a resident of Al Dhahira Governorate, developed symptoms including shortness of breath, high-grade fever, and dry cough on 18 April which lasted for six days. On 24 April, he was taken to the emergency department of a hospital. Upon examination and assessment, he was found to be in severe respiratory distress, febrile, and hypotensive and diagnosed with clinical pneumonia with fluid collection in the lungs and was admitted to the isolation ward. The condition of the patient deteriorated, and he was immediately transferred to a negative pressure isolation room, in the medical ward on the same day. On 25 April, his condition worsened, and he was then transferred to an isolation room in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and placed on mechanical ventilation. Respiratory samples were tested for several viral pathogens, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. A sepsis workup including blood and urine tests was performed and tested positive for MERS-CoV by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on 27 April.\u00a0As of 8 May, the condition of the patient remains critically unstable and he continues to be mechanically ventilated in an isolation room in the ICU. The patient has no known co-morbidities. There was no history of contact with similar cases, no history of travel nor previous hospitalization. However, the patient has a history of direct contact with animals including dromedaries, sheep and goats at his family farm in Oman.",
        "Epidemiology": "Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory infection that is caused by a coronavirus called Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease resulting in high mortality. Approximately 35% of patients with MERS have died, but this may be an overestimate of the true mortality rate, as mild cases of MERS-CoV may be missed by existing surveillance systems and until more is known about the disease, the case fatality rates are counted only amongst the laboratory-confirmed cases.Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedary camels who are the natural host and zoonotic source of the MERS-CoV infection. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts and in health care settings. Outside of the healthcare setting there has been limited human-to-human transmission.MERS-CoV infections range from showing no symptoms (asymptomatic) or mild respiratory symptoms to severe acute respiratory disease and death. A typical presentation of MERS-CoV disease is fever, cough and shortness of breath. Pneumonia is a common finding, but not always present. Gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhoea, have also been reported. Severe illness can cause respiratory failure that requires mechanical ventilation and support in an intensive care unit. The virus appears to cause more severe disease in older people, persons with weakened immune systems and those with chronic diseases such as renal disease, cancer, chronic lung disease, and diabetes.No vaccine or specific treatment is currently available, although several MERS-CoV specific vaccines and treatments are in development. Treatment is supportive and based on the patient\u2019s clinical condition.",
        "Public Health Response": "As of 28 April, a total of six close community and 27 health care workers were listed as contacts and followed up for 14 days from the last date of exposure to the MERS-CoV patient. All high-risk contacts, such as healthcare workers, were monitored for symptoms and screened for MERS CoV by RT-PCR as per the Ministry of Health Infection Prevention and Control guideline for MERS-COV exposures and cases. No secondary cases have been reported to date from Oman.\u00a0 \u00a0Infection, prevention and control (IPC)measures were implemented in the hospital where the patient was admitted.\u00a0\u00a0Healthcare workers were educated on MERS and a refresher training course on IPC measures was provided.Family members identified as close contacts of the case were educated on personal and respiratory hygiene to prevent further transmission\u00a0The Ministry of Agriculture has investigated the farms of the patient\u2019s family and close relatives; samples from the dromedaries have been collected for testing. As of 8 May 2022, results remain pending.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Cases of MERS-CoV infection are rare in Oman. Since June 2013, a total of 25 MERS-CoV cases, including the current case, and seven deaths, have been reported to WHO from Oman.As of 15 May 2022, the total number of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection cases reported globally to WHO is 2591 including 894 associated deaths. The majority of the reported cases have occurred in countries in the Arabian Peninsula. Outside of this region, there has been one large outbreak in the Republic of Korea, in May 2015, during which 186 laboratory-confirmed cases (185 in Republic of Korea and 1 in China) and 38 deaths were reported. The global number reflects the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths reported to WHO under International Health Regulations (2005) to date.The notification of this case does not change the overall risk assessment for MERS. It is expected that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East and/or other countries where MERS-CoV is circulating in dromedaries, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who were exposed to the virus through contact with dromedaries or their products (for example, consumption of camel\u2019s raw milk), or in a healthcare setting.\u00a0WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts a risk assessment based on the latest available information.",
        "WHO Advice": "Surveillance: Based on the current situation and available information, WHO re-emphasizes the importance of strong surveillance by all Member States for acute respiratory infections, including MERS-CoV, and to carefully review any unusual patterns.Infection prevention and control in health care settings: Human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV in healthcare settings has been associated with delays in recognizing the early symptoms of MERS-CoV infection, slow triage of suspected cases and delays in implementing IPC measures. IPC measures are therefore critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV between people, particularly in health care facilities.\u00a0Healthcare workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, at every interaction in healthcare settings:\u2022 Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection.\u2022 Contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection.\u2022 Airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol-generating procedures or in settings where aerosol-generating procedures are conducted.Case management: Early identification, case management and isolation of cases, quarantine of contacts, together with appropriate infection prevention and control measures in health care settings and public health awareness can prevent human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV.MERS-CoV appears to cause more severe disease in people with underlying chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons. Therefore, people with these underlying medical conditions should avoid close contact with animals, particularly dromedary camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. Timely, effective, and safe supportive management of patients with MERS should be provided, particularly for those at risk of more severe disease.\u00a0Infection prevention and control in the community: General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to. Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.International travel and trade: WHO does not advise specific MERS-CoV screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.",

Monkeypox was suspected and the case was immediately isolated. Monkeypox was suspected and the case was immediately isolated. As of 11 May, extensive contact tracing has been undertaken to identify exposed contacts in healthcare settings, the community and the international flight. These individuals are being followed up for 21 days from the date of last exposure with the case. None has reported compatible symptoms so far.\nSince the case was immediately isolated and contact tracing was performed, the risk of onward transmission related to this case in the United Kingdom is minimal. However, as the source of infection in Nigeria is not known, there remains a risk of ongoing transmission in this country.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 7 May 2022, the National IHR Focal Point for the United Kingdom notified WHO of a confirmed case of monkeypox in an individual who travelled from United Kingdom to Nigeria from late April to early May 2022 and stayed in Lagos and Delta States in Nigeria. The case developed a rash on 29 April and arrived in the United Kingdom on 4 May, departing Nigeria on 3 May.\u00a0 On the same day (4 May), the case presented to hospital. Based on the travel history and rash illness, monkeypox was suspected at an early stage and the case was isolated immediately.\u00a0 Appropriate use of personal protective equipment was ensured during hospitalization. Monkeypox (West African clade) was laboratory confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on a vesicular swab on 6 May by the United Kingdom Health Security Agency (UKHSA) Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory.",

Post-exposure prophylaxis with vaccination is being offered to the higher risk contacts.\u2022 Nigerian authorities were informed about this case and travel history in Nigeria on 7 May. The case did not report contact with anyone with a rash illness or known monkeypox in Nigeria. Details of travel and contacts within Nigeria have been shared with authorities in Nigeria for follow up as necessary.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "In the United Kingdom, there have been seven cases of monkeypox previously reported; all importations were related to a travel history to or from Nigeria. In 2021, there were also two separate human monkeypox cases imported from Nigeria reported by the United States of America.Since September 2017, Nigeria has continued to report cases of monkeypox. From September 2017 to 30 April 2022, a total of 558 suspected cases have been reported from 32 states in the country. Of these, 241 were confirmed cases, and among these there were eight deaths recorded (Case Fatality Ratio: 3.3%). From 1 January to 30 April 2022, 46 suspected cases have been reported of which 15 were confirmed from seven states - Adamawa (three cases), Lagos (three cases), Cross River (two cases), Federal Capital Territory (FCT) (two cases), Kano (two cases), Delta (two cases) and Imo (one case). No death has been recorded in 2022.In the present case, the source of infection is currently unknown and the risk of further transmission in Nigeria cannot be excluded. Once monkeypox was suspected in the United Kingdom, authorities promptly initiated appropriate public health measures, including isolation of the case and contact tracing. The risk of potential onward spread related to this case in the United Kingdom is therefore minimal. As the source of infection in Nigeria is not known, there remains a risk of further transmission in Nigeria.Importations of monkeypox from an endemic country to another country has been documented on eight previous occasions. In this instance, the confirmed case has a history of travel from Delta state in Nigeria, where monkeypox is endemic.",
        "WHO Advice": "Any illness during travel or upon return from an endemic area should be reported to a health professional, including information about all recent travel and immunization history. Residents and travelers to endemic countries should avoid contact with sick animals (dead or alive) that could harbour monkeypox virus (rodents, marsupials, primates) and should refrain from eating or handling wild game (bush meat). The importance of hand hygiene using soap and water, or alcohol-based sanitizer should be emphasized. While a vaccine and specific treatment have recently been approved for monkeypox, in 2019 and 2022 respectively, these countermeasures are not yet widely available.A patient with monkeypox should be isolated and provided with supportive care during the presumed and known infectious periods, that is during the prodromal (early signs) and rash stages of the illness, respectively. Timely contact tracing, surveillance measures and raising awareness of imported emerging diseases among health care providers are essential for preventing further secondary cases and effective management of monkeypox outbreaks.Health workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed monkeypox should implement standard, contact and droplet infection control precautions. This includes all workers such as cleaners and laundry personnel who may be exposed to the patient care setting, bedding, towels, or personal belongings. Samples taken from people with suspected monkeypox or animals with suspected monkeypox virus infection should be handled by trained staff working in suitably equipped laboratories.International travel and trade: WHO does not recommend any restriction for travel to and trade with Nigeria or the United Kingdom based on available information at this time.",

        "Date Reported": "16 May 2022",
        "Location": "Cameroon",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "Cameroon is among several countries in West and Central Africa experiencing recurrent cholera outbreaks. Between 29 October 2021 and 30 April 2022, a total of 6652 suspected cases including 134 deaths (case fatality ratio 2%) have been reported.\nSeveral risk factors can be attributed to the ongoing cholera outbreaks in Cameroon, including wide circulation of Vibrio cholerae in the country, limited access to safe drinking water in some areas, a seasonal pattern of cholera occurrence and inadequate WASH conditions.",
        "Description of the Situation": "Cameroon has been reporting suspected cases of cholera since the beginning of 2021. The outbreak was declared by health authorities on 29 October 2021 and has been ongoing since then. As of 30 April 2022, 6652 suspected cases of cholera including\n134 deaths (CFR 2%) have been reported from six regions - the South-West (4617 cases, 77 deaths), Littoral (1704 cases, 51 deaths), South (183 cases, two deaths), Central (125 cases, four deaths), North (15 cases, no death) and Far North (eight\ncases, no death) regions. Of the 6652 suspected cases, 5960 cases (90%) including 93 deaths (69%) have been reported in 2022. Between 29 October 2021 and 30 April 2022, a total of 1008 stool samples were tested from all six regions and 40 % (403)\nwere confirmed positive for Vibrio cholerae O1 by culture.Although the cholera outbreak started in late October, the number of weekly suspected cases increased from less than 200 in week nine of 2022 (ending 6 March) to 1262 in week 12 (ending 27 March). The overall CFR reported so far in 2022 (CFR 2%) is\nlower than CFR reported in 2021 (CFR 3.6%), however, it remains higher than the CFR of 1% expected during a cholera outbreak when timely treatment is available.\u00a0 Furthermore, the Central and Littoral regions continue to report high CFRs (CFR\n2.9% and 3%, respectively).While two regions, Central and South-West, reported cases of cholera in 2021, there has been a geographical expansion of the outbreak to five regions (Central, Littoral, North, South, South-West) since March 2022.\u00a0As of 30 April, the South-West region continues to be the most affected region with 4617 cases (69%) including 77 deaths (CFR 1.6%), of which 4069 cases (88%) were reported in 2022.\u00a0 Littoral is the second most affected region with 1704 (26%) cases\nand 51 deaths (CFR 3%), including 1684 (99%) cases reported in 2022.Figure-1: Epi curve of cholera cases by date of symptom onset and outcome, Cholera, from 29 October to 30 April (n=6652)Note: SE corresponds to Epidemiological week.

        "Epidemiology": "Cholera is an acute enteric infection caused by ingesting the bacteria\u00a0Vibrio cholerae\u00a0present in contaminated water or food. It is mainly linked to insufficient access to safe drinking water and inadequate sanitation. It is an extremely virulent disease that can cause severe acute watery diarrhoea resulting in high morbidity and mortality, and can spread rapidly, depending on the frequency of exposure, the exposed population and the setting. Cholera affects both children and adults and can be fatal if untreated.The incubation period is between 12 hours and five days after ingestion of contaminated food or water. Most people infected with V. cholerae do not develop any symptoms, although the bacteria are present in their faeces for 1-10 days after infection and are shed back into the environment, potentially infecting other people. Among people who develop symptoms, the majority have mild or moderate symptoms, while a minority develop acute watery diarrhoea with severe dehydration. Cholera is an easily treatable disease. Most people can be treated successfully through prompt administration of oral rehydration solution (ORS).Cholera can be endemic or epidemic. A cholera-endemic area is an area where confirmed cholera cases were detected during the last three years with evidence of local transmission (cases are not imported from elsewhere). A cholera epidemic can occur in both endemic countries and in non-endemic countries.The consequences of a humanitarian crisis \u2013 such as disruption of water and sanitation systems, or the displacement of populations to inadequate and overcrowded camps \u2013 can increase the risk of cholera transmission, should the bacteria be present or introduced. Uninfected dead bodies have never been reported as the source of epidemics.A multifaceted approach including a combination of surveillance, water, sanitation and hygiene, social mobilization, treatment, and oral cholera vaccines is essential to control cholera outbreaks and to reduce deaths.",
        "Public Health Response": "WHO has deployed teams of experts to support the response and is providing technical, logistical and financial support to the government. In addition, The national incident management system is conducting regular coordination meetings with partners at the central and regional levels to support district teams.A response plan was developed by the Ministry of Health and includes response partners.Cholera kits have been provided to aid the response.Advocacy meetings continue to be conducted with local and international partners.Response teams were deployed to major outbreak sites to support the response activities and conduct investigations.From 18 to 23 February, the first round of an oral cholera vaccine (OCV) campaign was organized in four health districts in South-West region. This campaign targeted 204 800 people with 85.5% administrative coverage. The vaccination campaign was extended to 11 more districts in the Littoral, South and the South-West Regions from 8 to 12 April 2022, targeting 842 086 people with an administrative coverage of 89%. This was combined with WASH interventions including distribution of water purification tablets (Aquatabs). Mass chemoprophylaxis with OCV was performed in a prison region where a cholera outbreak was reported in late March.Surveillance activities have been strengthened for active case finding and patient referrals in affected districts.Decontamination of outbreak sites and households of confirmed cases have been conducted.Community members and leaders were trained on hand washing, purification of water and disinfection of homes and public spaces.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Cameroon is among several countries in West and Central Africa experiencing recurrent cholera outbreaks. Several risk factors including circulation of Vibrio cholerae especially in the North, Littoral, Central, and South-West regions, limited access to safe drinking water in some areas including in the capital city of Yaound\u00e9, as well as cultural practices that contribute to unsafe WASH conditions exist in the country. There is a seasonal pattern of cholera occurrence in Cameroon that varies by region.\u00a0 In South-West and Littoral, currently the most affected regions, cholera is most often reported during the rainy season (November - April) or the transition between the rainy and the dry season. In the Central region, cholera is more frequently reported during the rainy season that occurs in May-June and October-November. The ongoing rainy season may increase the likelihood of further transmission in the country.In addition, some affected areas of the country are insecure which further reduces the access to services making outbreak response more complex.The cholera outbreak began surging in late October 2021, deteriorated further in March 2022 with the South-West region reporting 70% of cases. Limited geographic accessibility of some areas, security constraints, and suboptimal communication networks lead to irregular epidemiological updates and potential underreporting of cases. Additionally, high population movement of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), weak health system, insufficient human resources, poor knowledge of treatment protocols and low risk communication for cholera continue to pose challenges.Furthermore, in the northern areas, Cameroon is bordered by Adamawa, Borno and Taraba states of Nigeria and there is frequent and substantial cross border movement posing a risk of transmission. There is also a risk of further international spread especially to the Republic of Chad which borders both Nigeria and Cameroon.The country is conducting cholera vaccination which should help contain the outbreak, however, additional efforts supplemented by other interventions including access to adequate treatment and clean water are needed in order to control the outbreak.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO recommends improving access to clean water and sanitation, good waste management, food safety practices and hygienic practices to prevent the transmission of cholera. Oral cholera vaccines should be used in combination with improvements in water and sanitation to control cholera outbreaks and for prevention in areas known to be high risk for cholera. Strengthening surveillance, especially at the community level, is advised. Appropriate case management, including improving access to care, should be implemented in outbreak-affected areas to reduce mortality. There is a need to ensure that countries are ready to quickly detect and respond to this cholera outbreak to reduce the risk of spread to new areas. Setting up oral rehydration points (ORPs) in communities is also critical to provide early management through oral rehydration, screening and referral of patients. As the outbreak is occurring in border areas where there is significant cross border movement, WHO encourages the respective countries to ensure cooperation and regular information sharing.International travel or trade: WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel and trade to and from Cameroon based on the information available on the current outbreak.",

        "Date Reported": "13 May 2022",
        "Location": "Guinea",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 22 April 2022, the Ministry of Health and Public Hygiene of Guinea declared a Lassa fever outbreak following the laboratory confirmation of two cases from the Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou prefecture in the southeast of Guinea. Lassa fever is endemic in several countries in West Africa and Guinea has previously reported outbreaks as well as sporadic cases. Given that the Guinean health system has been overwhelmed due to several concurrent emerging and re-emerging infectious disease outbreaks since last year, this current outbreak may have a serious public health impact. To date, no deaths have been reported.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 20 April 2022, local health authorities were notified of a suspected case of hemorrhagic fever in Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou prefecture, southeast Guinea (Figure 1). The case was a 17-year-old female who experienced fever and loss of appetite on 12 April. From 16 to 17 April, the case additionally reported chest pain and physical weakness. On 18 April, the case sought medical care, and was admitted to a hospital on 19 April. The case received home care for five days since symptom onset and consulted two health facilities, which resulted in 141 reported contacts. On 20 April, a blood sample was collected from the suspected case, and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses were performed at the Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou hemorrhagic fever laboratory for Ebola, Marburg and Lassa fever. The case tested negative for Ebola and Marburg on 20 April but was confirmed positive for Lassa fever on 21 April. On 22 April, a second test was conducted at the reference laboratory in Conakry, which tested positive again. On the same day, the Minister of Health and Public Hygiene declared a Lassa fever outbreak. The case is currently receiving care at a health facility in Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou.On 28 April, a second confirmed case of Lassa fever, with no known epidemiological link to the first case, was reported in Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou prefecture. The case was a 24-year-old male. On 16 April, he presented with chest pain and insomnia and sought care at a private clinic on 18 April. On 28 April, he sought care at the provincial hospital for symptoms including fever, headache, vomiting, thoracic pain and bloody stools. On 29 April, he was confirmed positive for Lassa fever by laboratory testing in a treatment facility in Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou. Epidemiological investigations are underway to determine the source of the infection.Figure 1. Distribution of confirmed cases (n=2) of Lassa fever reported in Guinea in April 2022",
        "Epidemiology": "Lassa fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic disease caused by the Lassa virus. It is primarily transmitted to humans either through direct contact with infected\u00a0Mastomys\u00a0rodents, or through food or household items contaminated with the urine or faeces of infected rodents. Although to a lesser extent, transmission can also occur from human-to-human through direct contact with blood or bodily fluids of an infected person, mainly in a hospital setting, due to the lack of adequate infection prevention and control measures. Most cases (approximately 80%) are asymptomatic or mild, but the virus can cause severe disease in the remaining 20% of patients with a case fatality ratio (CFR) of approximately 15% among severely ill patients. \u00a0Early supportive care for patients is critical and improves survival. There is currently no vaccine that protects against Lassa fever.Lassa fever is endemic in the West African countries of Benin, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria, and is likely to be present in other West African countries as well. In Guinea, Lassa fever was first diagnosed in October 2011. Since then, outbreaks and sporadic cases have been reported in Guinea. The last reported outbreak of Lassa fever in Guinea was in 2021, with 8 cases and 7 deaths (88% CFR) reported in the prefectures of N'Z\u00e9r\u00e9kor\u00e9, Beyla, Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou and Yomou.",
        "Public Health Response": "The Ministry of Health and Public Hygiene, in collaboration with WHO and other partners, has responded to the outbreak by strengthening prevention activities in the region. The Ministry of Health and Public Hygiene has:Developed a response plan and is mobilizing funds to finance it. Delivered drugs and case management supplies to the field. Deployed a rapid response team to support the response activities. Implemented standard interventions, including isolation of suspected cases, laboratory confirmation, infection prevention and control in health facilities, and social mobilization and community engagement.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "The risk for this outbreak at the national level is considered high, because Lassa virus is endemic in the country associated with the presence of the animal host reservoir, Mastomys rats. In addition, there are limited financial, human and logistical resources and the Guinean health system has been severely overwhelmed since last year. In 2021, Guinea experienced several concurrent emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases such as Ebola, Marburg, Lassa fever, measles, meningitis, yellow fever, vaccine-derived polio type 1, and COVID-19. This outbreak could have a serious impact on public health due to the already fragile health system. The results of preliminary epidemiological investigations suggest that there is a risk of nosocomial and community transmission from the first case. At the regional and global level, the risk of spread is considered low due to the primary mode of transmission of the disease, being the exposure to rodents. Although Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou is located in proximity to the international borders with Liberia and Sierra Leone, the risk of cross-border transmission of cases can be considered low. However, since Lassa fever is endemic in Liberia and Sierra Leone due to the presence of Mastomys rodents, the risk of exposure is present in these two countries.",
        "WHO Advice": "Prevention in communities: Good community hygiene is important to prevent rodents from entering homes. Effective measures include storing grain and other food in rodent-resistant containers, disposing of garbage away from homes, keeping homes clean, and keeping cats.Health care settings: Health care providers should always follow standard precautions for the prevention and control of health care-associated infections, regardless of the presumed diagnosis. These precautions include basic hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, personal protective equipment, injection safety, and safe funeral practices.Health workers caring for suspected or confirmed cases of Lassa fever should take additional infection control measures to avoid contact with the patient's blood or body fluids and contaminated surfaces or materials such as clothing and bed linens. When within one meter of patients, they should wear face protection (face shield or surgical mask and goggles), a clean, non-sterile, long-sleeved gown, and gloves (sterile for certain medical procedures).Surveillance and clinical management: In all countries where Lassa fever is endemic, it is important to improve early detection and clinical management of cases to reduce case fatality.\u00a0\u00a0Travel: WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel or trade in Guinea based on the current epidemiological situation.",

        "Outbreak name": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus",
        "Date Reported": "12 May 2022",
        "Location": "Qatar",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "From 22 March to 3 April 2022, two laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), including one death, were reported to the WHO by the National IHR Focal Point of Qatar. Both cases had frequent close contact with dromedary camels and consumption of their raw milk in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. The Qatar Ministry of Public Health immediately initiated case investigation and contact tracing. These are the first cases of MERS-CoV infection reported from Qatar since February 2020. The notification of these cases reiterates the need for global awareness of MERS-CoV but does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East and/or other countries where MERS-CoV is circulating in dromedaries.",
        "Description of the Situation": "Between 22 March and 3 April 2022, the National IHR Focal Point of Qatar reported two laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection to the WHO.The first case was a 50-year-old male, working and living in a camel farm in Al Shaniya Doha. On 16 March, the case presented to the emergency department at Hamad Medical Corporations in Doha with a history of productive cough for one-week, high grade fever and shortness of breath. The patient was admitted to the medical ward on 17 March, and on 18 March due to a deterioration of the health status was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). A nasopharyngeal swab was collected and tested positive for MERS-CoV by reverse transcription polymecercarase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (upE and Orf1a genes) at the virology laboratory, Hamad Medical Corporation on 19 March. The patient has no comorbidities, and reported frequent close contact with dromedary camels and consumption of their raw milk in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms.\u00a0 No recent travel history was reported for the case or any of the case\u2019s contacts. None of the identified four contacts reported symptoms of the disease and all tested MERS-CoV negative. No further information on the health status of the case is available at the time of writing.The second case was an 85-year-old male, dromedary camel owner living in Doha. On 18 March, the patient presented to the emergency department at Hamad Medical Corporations with a history of productive cough for one-week, high grade fever and shortness of breath, and was admitted to the medical ward on the same day, during which the clinical status of the patient deteriorated. A nasopharyngeal swab was collected and tested positive for MERS-CoV by RT-PCR (upE and ORF1a genes) at the Hamad Medical Corporation virology laboratory on 19 March. On 22 March, the patient was intubated and transferred to the ICU where he died on 14 April. The patient had comorbidities including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. The epidemiological investigation revealed that 14 days prior to admission to the hospital the case had travelled with his camel to Saudi Arabia, where he visited other dromedary camel owners. The case also reported frequent contact with dromedary camels, as well as consuming raw milk from dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia. The case initially presented to a health centre while he was in Saudi Arabia, with symptoms including vomiting, loss of appetite, fever, and chills. He was subsequently diagnosed with an acute urinary tract infection. The medical staff at the health center in Saudi Arabia referred him to a hospital, but he decided to return to Qatar immediately. Investigation of 12 household contacts and health care workers has been completed and all have tested negative for MERS-CoV . The IHR-NFP of Saudi Arabia has also been notified.Before these notifications, the last MERS-CoV infection reported from Qatar was in February 2020.\u00a0 Since 2012, Qatar has reported a total of 28 human cases of MERS-CoV, and 7 deaths, including the two new reported cases. There have been no hospital outbreaks or reported infections among healthcare workers.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "According to the national protocol for management of MERS-CoV cases, both patients were isolated, and the infection prevention and control protocol was activated. The Ministry of Public Health immediately initiated case investigation and contact tracing. Respiratory swabs were collected from 12 household contacts, 4 co-workers and 15 health care workers and all tested negative for MERS-CoV. None of the above contacts reported any symptoms of MERS-CoV. All contacts have been monitored until the end of their monitoring period (14 days from the last exposure to the patients) and no secondary cases were identified. Infection prevention and control measures in all health facilities have been reinforced by the Ministry of Public Health. Health education messages about appropriate preventive measures will be shared with all contacts and they will be advised to comply with the recommended public health measures for MERS-CoV and to report to the health authorities if they develop any respiratory symptoms. The Animal Health Resources Department has been notified and investigation of dromedary camels is ongoing.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "MERS-CoV is a viral respiratory infection of humans and dromedary camels which is caused by a coronavirus called Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus. Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease resulting in high mortality. Approximately 35% of reported patients with MERS-CoV have died, but this may be an overestimate of the true mortality rate, as mild cases of MERS-CoV may be missed by existing surveillance systems and the case fatality rates are counted only amongst the laboratory-confirmed cases.Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedaries who are the natural host and zoonotic source of MERS-CoV infection. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans but it has, so far, mainly occurred in health care settings and to a limited extent among close contacts. One of the new reported cases had travel history outside of Qatar and it is likely that the infection was acquired as a result of zoonotic infection from direct or indirect contact with infected dromedary camels. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be exported from countries where MERS-CoV is circulating in dromedaries by travelers who may acquire infection after exposure to: 1) infected dromedaries or dromedary products (for example, following contact with camels); or 2) to infected humans (for example, in a health care setting). As of 12 May 2022, the total number of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection cases reported globally to WHO is 2591 including 894 associated deaths and reflects the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths reported to WHO under IHR (2005) to date. The majority of the reported cases have occurred in countries in the Arabian Peninsula. Outside of this region, there has been one large outbreak in the Republic of Korea, in May 2015, during which 186 laboratory-confirmed cases (185 in Republic of Korea and 1 in China) and 38 deaths were reported. The notification of these cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East and/or other countries where MERS-CoV is circulating in dromedaries, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who were exposed to the virus through contact with dromedaries or their products (for example, consumption of camel\u2019s raw milk), or in a healthcare setting. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessments based on the latest available information.",
        "WHO Advice": "Based on the current situation and available information, WHO re-emphasizes the importance of strong surveillance by all Member States for acute respiratory infections, including MERS-CoV, and to carefully review any unusual patterns.As a general precaution, anyone visiting farms, markets, barns or other places where dromedaries are present, should practice general hygiene measures, including regular hand washing after touching animals, avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with hands, and avoiding contact with sick animals. People may also consider wearing protective gowns and gloves while professionally handling animals.The consumption of raw or undercooked animal products, including milk, meat, blood and urine, carries a high risk of infection from a variety of organisms that might cause disease in humans. Animal products processed appropriately through proper cooking or pasteurization are safe for consumption but should also be handled with care, to avoid cross-contamination with uncooked foods.Human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV in healthcare settings has been associated with delays in recognizing the early symptoms of MERS-CoV infection, slow triage of suspected cases and delays in implementing infection, prevention and control (IPC) measures. IPC measures are therefore critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV between people in health care facilities.Early identification, case management and isolation of cases, quarantine of contacts, together with appropriate infection prevention and control measures in health care setting and public health awareness can prevent human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV.Healthcare workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, at every interaction in healthcare settings.Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection;Contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection;Airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures or in settings where aerosol generating procedures are conducted.MERS-CoV appears to cause more severe disease in people with underlying chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons. Therefore, people with these underlying medical conditions should avoid close contact with animals, particularly dromedaries, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.",

        "Date Reported": "9 May 2022",
        "Location": "China",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 25 April 2022, the National Health Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China notified WHO of one confirmed case of human infection with an avian influenza A(H3N8) virus. This case appears to be the first reported case of human infection with an avian influenza A(H3N8) virus. No further cases have yet been detected among close contacts. Further epidemiological and virological investigation of this event is underway. Currently limited available epidemiologic and virologic information suggests that this avian influenza A(H3N8) virus has not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans, therefore, the risk at the national, regional and international level of disease spread among humans is assessed as low.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 25 April 2022, the National Health Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China notified WHO of one confirmed case of human infection with an avian influenza A(H3N8) virus. The case is a 4-year-old boy from Henan Province. He developed fever, cough, shortness of breath on 5 April 2022, and was admitted to the hospital in critical condition on 10 April 2022 with severe pneumonia with respiratory failure. The case was then transferred to the ICU where antivirals were administered. Samples collected from the patient after hospitalization were tested for respiratory viruses (including influenza) and influenza A(H3N8) was detected in several samples. No other respiratory viruses were detected.On 24 April 2022, The National Influenza Center of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention tested the specimen sent from Henan Province. It confirmed that the influenza A virus in the sample was the A(H3N8) subtype and all genes were of avian origin.Before his onset of illness, the case had consumed chickens that were kept in the backyard but did not have direct exposure to them prior to illness onset. Clinical observation and sampling of the case\u2019s close contacts, environment, local poultry market, and wild bird habitat were conducted, and no infection or any symptoms of illness were found. Further epidemiological and virological investigation (i.e., animals and environmental testing) of this event is underway.",
        "Epidemiology": "This case appears to be the first reported case of human infection with an avian influenza A(H3N8) virus. No further cases have yet been detected among close contacts. There is limited information on the relatedness of the virus infecting this case to other avian influenza A(H3) viruses circulating in animals.Influenza type A viruses are classified into subtypes according to different virus surface proteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). So far, there are 18 different hemagglutinin subtypes and 11 different neuraminidase subtypes, with only a few of these subtypes circulating in humans (seasonal influenza). Depending on the origin host, influenza A viruses can also be classified as avian influenza, swine influenza, human influenza, etc., or other types of animal influenza viruses. When animal influenza viruses infect humans, these are called zoonotic infections.Zoonotic influenza type A infections may cause diseases ranging from mild upper respiratory infection (fever and cough) to rapid progression to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, shock, and even death.In terms of transmission, human infections with avian and other zoonotic influenza viruses, though rare, have been reported. Human infections are primarily acquired through direct contact with infected animals or contaminated environments but do not result in the efficient transmission of these viruses between people. The primary risk factor for human infection appears to be direct or indirect exposure to infected animals or contaminated environments, such as live bird markets. Slaughtering, defeathering, handling carcasses of infected poultry, and preparing poultry for consumption are also likely to be risk factors.Avian A(H3N8) influenza viruses are commonly detected globally in animals and represent one of the most frequently found subtypes in wild birds, causing minimal to no sign of disease in domestic poultry or wild birds. Cross-species transmission events of avian A(H3N8) influenza viruses have been reported for various mammal species, for example, equine and canine lineage of A(H3N8) viruses cause outbreaks in horses and dogs respectively.",
        "Public Health Response": "The Chinese government has taken the following monitoring, prevention, and control measures:Testing of close contacts, animals, and environment around the case;Conducting a risk assessment;Strengthening joint prevention and control;Strengthening surveillance and epidemiological investigation;Treatment of the patient;Carrying out a study on the origin of disease;Public risk communication activities to improve public awareness and adoption of self-protection measures.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Currently, limited available epidemiologic and virologic information suggests that this avian influenza A(H3N8) virus has not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans. Therefore, the risk at the national, regional and international level of disease spread is assessed as low. However, further sporadic human cases can be expected as long as the virus continues to be detected in poultry populations. Additional information from human and animal investigations and studies is needed to better assess the current risk posed to public health.The risk assessment will be reviewed in case further epidemiological or virological information indicates possible human-to-human transmission.",
        "WHO Advice": "Prevention: Countries should raise public awareness to avoid contact with high-risk environments such as live animal markets/farms and live poultry or surfaces that might be contaminated by poultry or bird feces.Personal protective measures include:Regular handwashing with proper drying of the handsGood respiratory hygiene \u2013 covering mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, using tissues and disposing of them correctlyEarly self-isolation of those feeling unwell, feverish, and having other symptoms of influenzaAvoiding close contact with sick peopleAvoiding touching one\u2019s eyes, nose, or mouthRespiratory protection when at-risk environmentAppropriate infection prevention and control measures in health care settings should always be applied. Health care workers performing aerosol-generating procedures should use airborne precautions. Standard contact and droplet precautions and appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) should be available during epidemics.Travelers to countries and people living in countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should, if possible, avoid poultry farms, contact with animals in live poultry markets, entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, and contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Good food safety and hygiene practices should be followed. Travelers returning from affected regions should report to local health services if respiratory symptoms zoonotic influenza virus infection.Surveillance: Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect virological, epidemiological, and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health and timely virus and information sharing for risk assessment. A thorough investigation of every human infection and timely virus sharing with a WHO Collaborating Centre for reference and research on influenza and genetic and antigenic characterization is essential.International Health Regulations: All human infections caused by a new subtype of influenza virus are notifiable under the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005). A novel influenza A virus is considered to have the potential to cause a pandemic, and Member State Parties are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a human infection caused by such an influenza A virus. This event does not change the current WHO recommendations on public health measures and influenza surveillance.International travel or trade: WHO does not recommend any travel and/or trade restrictions based on the currently available information.",

        "Outbreak name": "Avian Influenza A(H5N1)",
        "Date Reported": "6 May 2022",
        "Location": "United States of America",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "WHO was notified of a human case of avian influenza A (H5) in Colorado State in the United States of America on 29 April 2022. The case was involved in culling of poultry at a farm where influenza A (H5N1) virus was confirmed in the poultry. Avian influenza A (H5) was confirmed in the case on 27 April by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and subtype N1 was confirmed subsequently by sequence analysis. The close contacts and people involved in culling of poultry have been identified, tested and are currently being followed up. Based on available information, WHO assesses the risk to the general population posed by this virus to be low and for occupationally exposed persons it is considered to be low-to-moderate.\nThis is the first human case of influenza A (H5N1) virus reported in the United States of America.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 29 April 2022, the National IHR Focal Point of the United States of America notified WHO of a laboratory confirmed human case of avian influenza A(H5), in a male from Colorado State.The case developed fatigue on 20 April, during participation in slaughtering poultry from 18 to 22 April, at a commercial poultry facility in Colorado where influenza A (H5N1) virus had been confirmed in the poultry.Upon request of the organization providing personnel for culling of poultry at this facility, a respiratory sample was collected from the case on 20 April. The sample was received by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment Laboratory Services on 22 April and testing was completed on 25 April. Influenza A virus was detected by reverse transcriptase- polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The sample was sent to the Influenza division of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for further confirmation. Influenza A(H5) virus was confirmed by RT-PCR on 27 April and subtype N1 was subsequently confirmed by sequence analysis.\u00a0On 26 April 2022, the patient was isolated and treated with antivirals. The patient did not report symptoms other than fatigue, was not hospitalized and has since recovered.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "On 20 April 2022, a total of nine samples from close contacts of the case and persons who participated in culling of poultry at the same facility were collected; all tested negative for influenza. Additional respiratory specimens were obtained on 28 April from the same nine contacts and tested negative for influenza.\u00a0Virus characterization including genetic analysis to compare the virus sequence obtained from the human sample to virus sequences obtained from the poultry outbreak and antigenic analysis to compare with existing candidate H5 vaccine viruses are ongoing.The close contacts of the patient have been recommended to receive influenza antiviral prophylaxis. The investigation is ongoing to determine if there are additional close contacts.All individuals who were exposed to poultry and involved in depopulation activities at this facility are being monitored for symptoms for 10 days following the last date of their last exposure and will be tested if symptomatic in accordance with the US CDC guidelines and US Department of Agriculture guidance. Close contacts of the index case are also being monitored.\u00a0Thus far, no evidence of human-to-human transmission of influenza A (H5N1) virus in this event has been identified.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Since 2003 to 31 March 2022, a total of 864 cases and 456 deaths of influenza A(H5N1) human infection have been reported worldwide from 18 countries, however, this is the first reported case in the United States of America. The most recent case in humans prior to the current case, was reported in January 2022 in a case who had symptom onset in December 2021, from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\u00a0Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk for sporadic infection and small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. Therefore, sporadic human cases are not unexpected.The virus has not been detected in humans beyond this single case in the United States of America. Public health measures from both the human and animal health agencies have been implemented. Based on available information, WHO assesses the risk to the general population posed by this virus to be low and for occupationally exposed persons it is considered to be low-to-moderate.\u00a0There are no specific vaccines for preventing influenza A(H5N1) in humans. Candidate vaccines to prevent influenza A(H5) virus infection in humans have been developed for pandemic preparedness purposes. Close analysis of the epidemiological situation, further characterization of the most recent viruses (human and poultry) and serological investigations are critical to assess associated risk and to adjust risk management measures in a timely manner.",
        "WHO Advice": "This case does not change the current WHO recommendations on public health measures and surveillance of influenza.Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect and monitor virological, epidemiological and clinical changes associated with emerging or circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health and timely virus sharing for risk assessment.In the case of a confirmed or suspected human infection caused by a novel influenza virus with pandemic potential, including a variant virus, a comprehensive epidemiologic investigation (even while awaiting the confirmatory laboratory results) of history of exposure to animals, of travel, and contact tracing should be conducted. The epidemiologic investigation should include early identification of unusual respiratory events that could signal person-to-person transmission of the novel virus and clinical samples collected from the time and place that the case occurred should be tested and sent to a WHO Collaboration Center for further characterization.When avian influenza viruses are circulating in an area, people involved in specific, high-risk tasks such as sampling sick birds, culling and disposing of infected birds, eggs, litters and cleaning of contaminated premises should be trained on the proper use of and provided with appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). All persons involved in these tasks should be registered and monitored closely by local health authorities for seven days following the last day of contact with poultry or their environments.Travelers to countries with known outbreaks of animal influenza should avoid farms, contact with animals in live animal markets, entering areas where animals may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with animal feces. Travelers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travelers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices. Should infected individuals from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during travel or after arrival. If this were to occur, further community level spread is considered unlikely as this virus has not acquired the ability to transmit easily among humans.All human infections caused by a novel influenza subtype are notifiable under the International Health Regulations (IHR) and State Parties to the IHR (2005) are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic. Evidence of illness is not required for this report.International travel or trade: WHO does not advise special traveler screening at points of entry or restrictions with regard to the current situation of influenza viruses at the human-animal interface.",

        "Outbreak name": "Japanese encephalitis",
        "Date Reported": "28 April 2022",
        "Location": "Australia",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "As of 28 April 2022, a cumulative of 37 human cases of Japanese encephalitis (25 laboratory-confirmed cases and 12 probable cases) have been reported in four states in Australia with symptom onset dating back to 31 December 2021. This outbreak represents the first locally-acquired cases detected on the Australian mainland since 1998. Enhanced and targeted surveillance activities are ongoing to better understand the extent of transmission and to inform control activities. Further investigations are needed to assess the ongoing risk in Australia.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 7 March 2022, the Australian health authorities notified WHO of three laboratory-confirmed human cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE). The first human JE case was reported on 3 March 2022 from Queensland. As of 28 April 2022, the Australian Government\u2019s Department of Health reported 37 cumulative confirmed and probable human cases of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection, including three deaths (2 confirmed, 1 probable). Twenty-five confirmed cases were reported from four states: New South Wales (11 cases, 1 death), Queensland (2 cases), South Australia (3 cases) and Victoria (9 cases and 1 death). In addition, 12 probable cases have been reported from: New South Wales (2 cases), Queensland (2 cases), South Australia (5 cases, 1 death) and Victoria (3 cases) (Figure 1).Figure 1. Distribution of confirmed (n=25) and probable (n=12) human cases and deaths (n=3) of Japanese encephalitis (JE) and states in which JE virus has been detected in pigs, Australia, 2022.The number of JE cases and deaths reported in 2022 is unusually high as compared to only 15 cases notified in Australia\u00a0in the ten years prior to this outbreak. Of these 15 cases, only one case was acquired in Australia in the Tiwi Islands, Northern Territory; the remaining 14 cases were acquired overseas. These are also the first known locally-acquired detections of JE in humans in these states of Australia and the first detections in mainland Australia since a single case was detected in 1998 in Cape York, Queensland.JEV, which infects both humans and animals, has also been detected in animals in Australia. In late February 2022, JEV was confirmed in commercial pig farms in\u00a0the states of New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria, then in South Australia in early March. Affected piggeries had experienced unusual levels of reproductive losses and neonatal deaths. As of 20 April, JEV has been detected in 73 pig farms across the four states. Prior to February 2022, infection with JEV has not been previously detected in animals further south in mainland Australia than the northern peninsula area of Cape York.",
        "Epidemiology": "Although a rare disease in humans, JE is a serious viral infection caused by the JEV spread by infected\u00a0Culex\u00a0spp.\u00a0mosquitos in Asia (e.g.\u00a0Culex tritaeniorhynchus) and parts of the West Pacific (e.g.\u00a0Culex annulirostris). Numerous wild and domestic animal species can become infected, although most do not develop clinical signs and only a few develop sufficient viraemia (when the virus is present in bloodstream) to infect the mosquito vector which can result in further transmission. In natural cycles, wading birds such as herons and egrets are the important amplifying hosts, although pigs also develop significant viraemia that can infect vectors. The species most important in the ecology of the disease in Australia are yet to be determined.JEV cannot be transmitted from human to human, or by consuming meat from an infected animal. Prior to this outbreak, JEV was considered unusual in\u00a0Australia. Previously, JE was only rarely reported in humans in the north of Australia in Queensland (Torres Strait Islands and northern parts of Cape York Peninsula), with only 15 cases notified in\u00a0Australia\u00a0in the past ten years prior to this outbreak; only one of these cases acquired their infection in Australia with the remainder acquired overseas. In early 2021, one human case was reported from the Northern Territory (Tiwi Islands). The source of infection for this case remains unknown. The population of Australia is unlikely to have any significant natural immunity from prior infection, including asymptomatic infection, because the virus is not endemic to mainland Australia.The vast majority of JEV infections are asymptomatic. There are no treatments for JE and the case fatality rate among symptomatic cases can be as high as 30%. Permanent neurologic or psychiatric sequelae can occur in 30\u201350% of cases with encephalitis. In an immunologically na\u00efve population, all age groups are at risk for JEV infection. There are two JE vaccines for humans registered for use in Australia only advised for risk groups. There is no vaccine for animals registered for general use in Australia. A vaccine is available for use under permit in horses intended for export, and work is underway to make this vaccine available under an emergency use permit so that horse owners can protect their animals.",
        "Public Health Response": "The\u00a0Australian Government\u2019s Departments of Health and Agriculture, Water and Environment are working closely with state and territory government counterparts and affected animal industries to ensure a coordinated response across human and animal health.\u00a0The\u00a0Australia\u00a0Government has declared the JE outbreak a Communicable Disease Incident of National Significance under the Emergency Response Plan for Communicable Disease Incidents of National Significance. Epidemiological investigations are ongoing with increased and targeted surveillance activities being carried out. Australian authorities are implementing vector control activities to remove potential mosquito breeding sites, reduce vector populations and minimize individual exposures.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Human, animal and environmental investigations are ongoing to understand the increased transmission of JEV in humans and animals in Australia in 2022 and better assess the current and future risk. Serological evidence of JEV exposure is periodically detected in animals in the Torres Strait Islands off the north coast of Queensland, but transmission on the mainland has not been previously established. The current event therefore represents a significant change in the presence of the virus in Australia. Local transmission of JEV to humans requires environmental conditions capable of sustaining an enzootic cycle, thus, the risk of infection can vary substantially within any endemic country. JE transmission intensifies during the rainy season, during which vector populations increase. Internationally, there has not yet been evidence of increased JEV transmission following major floods or tsunamis.Thirty-seven confirmed and probable cases of infection with JEV including three deaths have been identified in Australia with symptom onsets from 31 December 2021. The latest symptom onset of the cases was 14 March 2022. The cases were reported from four different states, three of which had no history of past local JE virus transmission. Vaccination against JEV is not used for the general population in Australia and is usually only advised for people travelling to endemic regions and for people undertaking activities with increased risk of exposure, thus, the immunologically naive population could be more susceptible to severe disease. As the colder months approach in southern Australia, a reduction in mosquito populations, and with that, a reduction in transmission is expected in all susceptible species.The risk at the regional and global level is assessed as low. The JEV does not transmit between humans, therefore the likelihood of international disease spread among humans is low. However occasional overseas acquired cases have been reported among unvaccinated individuals returning from an area with active transmission.",
        "WHO Advice": "Vector control: WHO recommends increased public awareness of JEV in the affected states and the implementation of activities to remove potential mosquito breeding sites, reduce vector populations and minimize individual exposures, including vector control strategies targeting both the immature and adult stages of the mosquito. Vector control should include environmental management (eliminating stagnant pools of water including waste/polluted water) and chemical control (including larval control and adult vector control including residual spraying of walls of animal shelters with approved insecticides). Homes near pig farms or animal shelters should be protected with mosquito-proof screens on windows and doors.Personal protective measures: The peak biting period of Culex vectors is during the evening (after sunset) and night. Personal protective measures including use of mosquito repellent, should be encouraged. Insecticide-treated mosquito nets provide good protection during sleep at night.Surveillance:Strengthened surveillance is needed to assess the burden of JE, identify cases, inform vaccination strategies, monitor vaccine safety, and monitor the impact and effectiveness of JE vaccines. All JE-endemic countries are encouraged to carry out at least sentinel surveillance with laboratory confirmation of JE.Seroprevalence studies in pigs and feral pigs populations in affected states are needed to assess the magnitude of the risk. If seroprevalence in pigs is high, further seroprevalence studies in at-risk human communities are needed.Entomological surveillance using simple ovitraps with hay infusion near farms will support vector surveillance and monitoring the impact of control methods.Vaccination: Vaccine strategies should be designed and implemented with due consideration for the fact that, in an immunologically na\u00efve population, all age groups are at risk for JEV infection.During outbreaks: The value of reactive vaccination campaigns during outbreaks of JE has not been studied. If an outbreak occurs in a country or region where JE vaccination has not been introduced, an assessment needs to be made of whether it is appropriate to implement an immediate vaccine response, including considerations such as the size of the outbreak, timeliness of the response, population affected, and programmatic capacity. Due to the need for rapid production of protective antibodies, rapid deployment of at least one dose of live attenuated or live recombinant vaccines should be used.Routine immunisation: JE vaccination should be integrated into national immunization schedules in all areas where JE is recognized as a public health priority. Even if the number of JE confirmed cases is low, vaccination should be considered where there is a suitable environment for JEV transmission, i.e. presence of animal reservoirs, ecological conditions supportive of virus transmission, and proximity to other countries or regions with known JEV transmission. Adjunctive interventions, such as bednets and mosquito control measures, should not divert efforts from childhood JE vaccination. As JE is not transmitted person-to-person, vaccination does not induce herd immunity and high vaccination coverage for individual protection should be achieved and sustained in populations at risk of the disease. This will allow JE disease in humans to be virtually eliminated despite ongoing virus circulation in the animal cycle.Endemic areas: The most effective immunization strategy in JE endemic settings is a one-time campaign (possibly wide age range) in the primary target population, followed by the introduction in routine immunization for infant birth cohorts as defined by local epidemiology. Travel and trade: WHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions based on the current information available on this event.",

        "Date Reported": "28 April 2022",
        "Location": "Democratic Republic of the Congo",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "The Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo declared an outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in the country after a case was confirmed from Mbandaka, Equateur province. The onset of symptoms was on 5 April. The case subsequently died on 21 April, and a safe and dignified burial was performed. The second case, a family member, was confirmed on 25 April. As of 27 April, 267 contacts have been identified; other measures, including contact tracing, further investigations, decontamination of households and health facilities, are ongoing.\nThis is the third EVD outbreak in Equateur province and the sixth in the country since 2018. Previous outbreaks in Equateur province occurred in 2020 and 2018, with 130 and 54 confirmed and probable cases recorded, respectively.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 23 April 2022, the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo declared an outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) after laboratory confirmation of a case, a 31-year-old male from Mbandaka.\u00a0 a city of approximately 1.2 million people\nin the north-western Equateur province. The case had symptoms onset on 5 April, with fever and headache, and was under home treatment with antimalarial drugs and antibiotics before being admitted to two health facilities between 16 and 21 April, where\ninfection prevention and control (IPC) measures were inadequate. Given the persistence of symptoms and appearance of haemorrhagic signs on 21 April, he was admitted to the General Referral Hospital in Wangata. He died on 21 April after which a safe\nand dignified burial was conducted. A blood sample taken by the provincial laboratory in Mbandaka tested positive for Ebola virus by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on 21 April, and an oral swab analysed on 22 April also tested\npositive for Ebola virus. For confirmation, blood samples and oral swabs were sent to the reference laboratory, the National Institute of Biomedical Research (INRB) in Kinshasa and tested positive for Ebola virus by RT-PCR.On 25 April, health authorities confirmed a second EVD case, a 25-year-old woman from Mbandaka who was a family member of the first case. She developed symptoms on 13 April and was treated at home for five days. While symptomatic, she visited a prayer\nhouse, a health center, a pharmacy and a nurse\u2019s home. She died on 25 April and a safe and dignified burial was performed on the same day.\u00a0Ebola virus disease is present in animal reservoirs in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and before this EVD outbreak, the country had reported 13 EVD outbreaks since 1976. The current outbreak is the third EVD outbreak in Equateur province and\nthe sixth in the country since 2018. The last outbreak in the Equateur Province was declared over in November 2020, after 130 confirmed and probable cases were recorded and nearly six months after the first cases were reported (more details, published\nin\u00a0Disease outbreak news on 18 November 2020).\u00a0\u00a0Full genome sequencing was performed at the INRB in Kinshasa and results indicate that this outbreak represents a new spill-over from the animal population. Figure-1: Confirmed cases of EVD in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as of 27 April",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "The Ministry of Health (MoH), in coordination with WHO and other partners have initiated measures to control the outbreak and prevent further spread. The MoH has activated the national and provincial emergency management committees to coordinate the response. Multidisciplinary teams are being reassigned to manage this outbreak. Outbreak control interventions are being organized in the field and include case investigation, contact tracing, surveillance at points of entry and checkpoints, isolation of suspected cases, laboratory confirmation, IPC measures in health facilities as well as community engagement and social mobilization.\u00a0EVD response interventions include:\u00a0Strong engagement with communities focusing on EVD prevention, early recognition of symptoms and care seeking and vaccination.Case investigations and contact tracing activities including on-going in-depth interventions around the two confirmed cases. To date 267 contacts have been identified of which two suspected cases have tested negative for EVD.Alert system is being set-up in the affected areas.Sixteen points of control have been activated in Mbandaka.\u00a0A functional laboratory is established in Mbandaka, and supplies have been delivered.On 24 April, the International Coordinating Group on vaccine provision received and approved the use of 1307 doses of the Ervebo licensed vaccine stored in Goma. On 26 April, 200 doses of Ervebo vaccine and matching injection devices arrived in Mbandaka.\u00a0 Ring vaccination started on 27 April. Further doses will be shipped as needed and as ultra-cold chain capacities are strengthened in Mbandaka. On-going assessment and rehabilitation of Mbandaka Ebola Treatment Centre and strengthening of screening, triage and isolation capacities of other health facilities.\u00a0Twenty treatment courses of monoclonal antibodies were received in Mbandaka on 26 April.Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) measures have been initiated and include decontamination of health facilities, assessment and support to health facilities and training of health care workers on implementation of IPC measures, and water and sanitation rehabilitation.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Preliminary information indicates that the first confirmed case was treated at home from the onset of symptoms before being admitted to two health facilities between 16 to 21 April. Since the case was isolated after the onset of haemorrhagic signs, there is a risk of EVD spread in the province. Additionally, due to inadequate IPC measures in place at the health facilities there is also the risk of spread among health workers and co-patients of the two facilities which the patient visited prior to the confirmation of EVD.The exposure of the first case remains unknown, and therefore, it is difficult to assess the extent of the outbreak at this stage.The current resurgence is not unexpected given that EVD is endemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Ebola virus is present in animal reservoirs in the region. A confluence of environmental and socioeconomic factors such as poverty, community mistrust, weak health systems, and political instability may be accelerating the rate of the emergence of EVD in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.Although Mbandaka has experienced two EVD outbreaks in 2020 and 2018, some of the improvements achieved by establishing capacities such as IPC measures in health facilities during previous outbreaks have not been maintained over time to tackle the current outbreak. There is a need to support the province's health professionals to conduct an effective response. In addition, logistical support is needed to reactivate the health infrastructure that was put in place during previous epidemics.The risk of regional and international spread of this epidemic is not precluded as the city of Mbandaka borders the Congo River and has river and land connections with the capital Kinshasa, the Republic of Congo, the Central African Republic, and Angola. Mbandaka also has air connections with Sud Ubangi province bordering Central African Republic and the Republic of Congo and the capital Democratic Republic of the Congo - Kinshasa.\u00a0The risk associated with EVD in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is high due to the presence of animal reservoirs or intermediate hosts implicated in previous spill-over events, the high frequency of these outbreaks, environmental and anthropogenic factors1 , and reduced capacity of the public health sector due to other ongoing outbreaks of cholera, measles, monkeypox, and COVID-19 pandemic in the context of\u00a0 a protracted humanitarian crisis due to ongoing violence and conflict.The risk at regional and global level is assessed to be moderate and low respectively. WHO is closely monitoring the situation and the risk assessment will be updated as more information becomes available.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO advises the following risk reduction measures as an effective way to reduce Ebola virus disease transmission in humans:Reducing the risk of wildlife-to-human transmission from contact with infected fruit bats or monkeys/apes and the consumption of their raw meat. Animals should be handled with gloves and other appropriate protective clothing. Animal products (blood and meat) should be thoroughly cooked before consumption.Reducing the risk of human-to-human transmission from direct or close contact with people with Ebola symptoms, particularly with their bodily fluids. Urgently refer any suspected cases to health care facility where patient should be screened, triaged and isolated accordingly. Appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) should be worn when taking care of patients suspected or confirmed with EVD. Regular hand washing is required after visiting patients in hospital, as well as after touching or coming into contact with any body fluids.\u00a0Reducing the risk of possible sexual transmission, based on further analysis of ongoing research and consideration by the WHO Advisory Group on the Ebola Virus Disease Response. WHO recommends that male survivors of EVD practice safe sex for 12 months from onset of symptoms or until their semen tests negative twice for Ebola virus. Contact with body fluids should be avoided and washing with soap and water is recommended. WHO does not recommend isolation of male or female convalescent patients whose blood has tested negative for Ebola virus.All EVD control intervention should be grounded into strong community engagement, aiming at building trust with affected populations and supporting them to implement preventive measures and adhere to response interventions.\u00a0Continue training and re-training of the health workforce for early detection, isolation, and treatment of EVD cases as well as re-training on safe and dignified burials and the IPC ring approach.Ensure availability of PPE and assess IPC capacities (including WASH and waste management) in all healthcare settings to manage ill patients and for decontamination.Prepare for ring vaccination of contacts and contacts of contacts of confirmed cases and of frontline workers.Engage with communities to reinforce safe and dignified burial practices.International travel or trade:WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel or trade to Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the current situation.",

        "Date Reported": "27 April 2022",
        "Location": "Somalia",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "Measles is endemic in Somalia with cases reported every year. In 2022, between epidemiological week 1 and 9, a cumulative of 3509 suspected measles cases have been reported from 18 regions in the country. Response activities are ongoing with WHO providing technical support on surveillance, vaccination, laboratory, case management, training of care health workers and risk communication. Given the low levels of vaccination coverage and a high prevalence of both malnutrition and vitamin A deficiency among children aged under 5 years, the overall risk for measles at the national level is assessed as very high. This risk is further aggravated by a complex humanitarian crisis caused by conflict and droughts, and related displacements.",
        "Description of the Situation": "Between 2 January and 5 March 2022, a cumulative of 3509 suspected measles cases have been reported from 18 regions in the country, largely from drought-affected districts. Of these 18 regions, six regions including Bay (1194 suspected cases), Mudug (796 suspected cases), Banaadir (559 suspected cases), Bari (277 suspected cases), Lower Shabelle (121 suspected cases) and Gedo (141 suspected cases) reported the highest number of measles cases.\u00a0 Between 2 January to 5 March, a total of 249 samples were collected and tested at four laboratories in the country (in Garowe, Hargeisa, Kismayo, and Mogadishu).\u00a0 Of these samples, 57% (142 samples) tested positive for measles Immunoglobulin M (IgM); 81% were less than five years of age.Measles is endemic in Somalia and the annual number of cases has varied substantially in recent years. The largest measles outbreak in recent years was recorded in 2017 when 23 039 suspected cases were reported in 118 districts across all six federal states and the Banaadir Regional Administration of Somalia. In the ongoing epidemic in drought affected districts, a total of 2596 suspected measles cases were reported to WHO in 2020, while a total of 7494 suspected measles cases were reported in 2021.According to the WHO-UNICEF national estimates of immunization coverage, coverage with the first dose of the measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) is suboptimal in Somalia, estimated at around 46% for the last 10 years. The measles-containing vaccine second dose (MCV2) was introduced to the routine immunization program in November 2021 \u2013 but it is not yet introduced in Somaliland.Figure 1: Epi curve of suspected measles cases reported in drought affected districts of Somalia, from 2020 to 5 March 2022\u00a0\u00a0Note: Data for 2022 does not include newly detected suspected cases that are pending classification\u00a0Figure-2: Geographic distribution of suspected measles cases in Somalia reported from 2 January \u2013 5 March 2022\u00a0Note: Data does not include newly detected suspected cases that are pending classification",
        "Epidemiology": "Measles is a highly contagious disease caused by a virus in the paramyxovirus family. It is mainly transmitted through direct contact with infected persons, or indirectly via breathing in contaminated air or touching infected surfaces. The virus infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body.The first sign of measles is usually a high fever, which begins about 10 to 12 days after exposure to the virus and lasts four to seven days. A runny nose, a cough, red and watery eyes, and small white spots inside the cheeks can develop in the initial stage. After several days, a rash erupts, usually on the face and upper neck. Over about three days, the rash spreads, eventually reaching the hands and feet. The rash lasts for five to six days, and then fades. On average, the rash occurs 14 days after exposure to the virus (within a range of 7 to 18 days).Most measles-related deaths are caused by complications associated with the disease. Serious complications are more common in children under the age of five or adults over the age of 30. The most serious complications include blindness, encephalitis (an infection that causes brain swelling), severe diarrhoea and related dehydration, ear infections, or severe respiratory infections such as pneumonia. Severe measles is more likely among poorly nourished young children, especially those with insufficient vitamin A, or whose immune systems have been weakened by HIV/AIDS or other diseases.No specific antiviral treatment exists for measles virus. Severe complications from measles can be reduced through supportive care that ensures good nutrition, adequate fluid intake and treatment of dehydration.Routine measles vaccination for children, combined with mass immunization campaigns in countries with high case and death rates, are key public health strategies to reduce global measles deaths.",
        "Public Health Response": "The overall risk at the national level is assessed as very high due to:\u2022 Sub-optimal vaccination coverage through routine immunization and lack of recent supplemental immunization activities (SIA). The last SIA was conducted more than two years ago.\u2022 High levels of malnutrition and vitamin A deficiency in the context of food insecurity leading to increased morbidity and mortality. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimates that 4.5 million people in 71 districts in the country face food insecurity.\u2022 Shortage of essential medical supplies for the management of reported cases of measles.\u2022 An overstretched healthcare system with limited capacity to respond to the current outbreak.\u2022 Limited access to primary health care services for the high proportion of people displaced due to drought.\u2022 Delays in detection and response to alerts due to suboptimal integrated disease surveillance system and lack of reporting in the Early Warning Alert and Response Network (EWARN) which will likely lead to pockets of undetected transmission.\u2022 Limited laboratory capacity as only four laboratories in the country are conducting confirmatory measles testing.The overall risk at the regional level was assessed as moderate due to the unrestricted movement of people between Somalia and neighbouring countries (Ethiopia, Kenya, and Djibouti) where vaccination coverage is also suboptimal.The overall risk at the global level was assessed as low given the existing response capacity in place.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "",
        "WHO Advice": "Vaccination: Enhanced routine measles vaccination for children and conducting outbreak response mass immunization campaigns are key strategies for effective control of the epidemic and reducing mortality.WHO urges all Member States to:Ensure that routine immunization coverage with MVC1 and MVC2 is at least 95%.Conduct high-quality mass measles immunization campaigns in countries with low vaccine coverage, optimizing opportunities for integration.Ensure high-quality measles case-based surveillance as a critical strategy for outbreak control, early detection and confirmation of measles cases to ensure timely and proper case management to reduce morbidity and mortality and enable implementation of appropriate public health strategies to control further transmission.In countries that are in the elimination phase, provide a rapid response to imported measles cases through the activation of rapid response teams to stop transmission.Administer vitamin A supplementation to all children above six months of age diagnosed with measles to reduce the complications and mortality (two doses of 50 000 IU for children <6 months of age, 100 000 IU for children 6-12 months of age, or 200 000 IU for children 12-59 months of age, immediately upon diagnosis and on the following day).International travel or trade: WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel and trade based on available information.",

        "Date Reported": "27 April 2022",
        "Location": "Malawi",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "The Ministry of Health declared a cholera outbreak in Malawi on 3 March 2022, following laboratory confirmation of a case in in the country. A second case was detected in on 7 March. As of 26 April, 78 cholera cases and four deaths have been reported, of which 97% (76 cases) have been reported from Nsanje district. Several response measures have been implemented including delivery of cholera kits, mapping of hotspot districts.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 3 March 2022, the Ministry of Health Malawi declared a cholera outbreak in the country, following confirmation of a case in a 57-year-old male, from Machinga district, in Southern Malawi.\u00a0 On 28 February, the case developed watery diarrhoea and visited Machinga hospital where cholera was confirmed on 2 March.\u00a0 Samples from the patient tested positive by culture and Vibrio cholerae O1, serotype Inaba was isolated. The case had a history of travel to two cities \u2013 Blantyre and Machinga -- prior to being admitted to the district hospital. Although an epidemiological investigation was carried out, the source of the infection was not identified.On 7 March 2022, a second case was identified in a 11-year-old boy at a local health centre from Nsanje district, Malawi. The case was displaced to Mozambique following floods caused by the tropical storm Ana and cyclone Gombe and returned to Malawi\nwhile symptomatic.\u00a0\u00a0As of 26 April 2022, a total of 78 cholera cases with four deaths (case fatality ratio: 5.1%) have been reported from Nsanje (76 cases; four deaths) and Machinga (2 cases) districts (Figures 1 and 2). Of the 78 cases, 13 have been confirmed by culture,\nand 20 tested positive by rapid diagnostic test (RDT).\u00a0 The age of the cases range between 2 and 57 years, with the 5 to 14 years age group being the most affected.The Southern region of Malawi was severely affected by the tropical storm Ana and cyclone Gombe that caused torrential rains and floods between late January and February 2022. The displaced populations remained with no access to safe drinking water\nand sanitation facilities and thus, at risk of widespread disease outbreaks including cholera.Figure-1: Epi curve of cholera cases by date of symptom onset and outcome, Malawi, from 28 February to 26 April (n=78)Figure- 2: Distribution of cholera cases in Malawi, as of 26 April",
        "Epidemiology": "Cholera is an acute enteric infection caused by ingesting the bacteria Vibrio cholerae present in contaminated water or food. It is mainly linked to insufficient access to safe drinking water and inadequate sanitation. It is an extremely virulent disease that can cause severe acute watery diarrhoea resulting in high morbidity and mortality, and can spread rapidly, depending on the frequency of exposure, the exposed population and the setting. Cholera affects both children and adults and can be fatal if untreated.The incubation period is between 12 hours and 5 days after ingestion of contaminated food or water. Most people infected with V. cholerae do not develop any symptoms, although the bacteria are present in their faeces for 1-10 days after infection and are shed back into the environment, potentially infecting other people. Among people who develop symptoms, the majority have mild or moderate symptoms, while a minority develop acute watery diarrhoea with severe dehydration. Cholera is an easily treatable disease. Most people can be treated successfully through prompt administration of oral rehydration solution (ORS).Cholera can be endemic or epidemic. A cholera-endemic area is an area where confirmed cholera cases were detected during the last 3 years with evidence of local transmission (cases are not imported from elsewhere). A cholera epidemic can occur in both endemic countries and in non-endemic countries.The consequences of a humanitarian crisis \u2013 such as disruption of water and sanitation systems, or the displacement of populations to inadequate and overcrowded camps \u2013 can increase the risk of cholera transmission, should the bacteria be present or introduced. Uninfected dead bodies have never been reported as the source of epidemics.A multifaceted approach including a combination of surveillance, water, sanitation and hygiene, social mobilization, treatment, and oral cholera vaccines is essential to control cholera outbreaks and to reduce deaths.",
        "Public Health Response": "WHO, in coordination with partners, is supporting the implementation of the National Cholera Response Plan in Malawi.Other specific actions undertaken include:\u2022 National and district level emergency operation centres (EOCs) were activated and currently coordinating the response in collaboration with other health sectors and partners.\u2022 Initial mapping of the high risk/ hotspot districts was conducted in late February 2022, after the landfall of tropical storm, and an update was conducted on 25 March 2022.\u2022 The Ministry of Health and WHO jointly completed field supervision including risk and needs assessments. A comprehensive report is being prepared.\u2022 Four data managers and three public health officers were engaged and deployed to the affected districts for data management.\u2022 Cholera preparedness training was conducted from 21 to 22 April 2022 in Nsanje district.\u2022 WHO has provided cholera kits and other supplies to the affected districts.\u2022 A request for an oral cholera vaccine (OCV) submitted to the International Coordination Group (ICG) for 3.9 million doses of vaccines targeting eight high risk districts was approved. The country has received more than 1.9 million doses of OCV for the first round of the campaign planned for early May 2022.\u2022 Supplies for case management and laboratory confirmation of cholera are pre-positioned in health facilities and the district laboratory. Case management has been strengthened through the establishment of treatment structures and the provision of equipment. Two cholera treatment centres have been established in Nsanje district.\u00a0\u2022 The collection and analysis of stool samples for confirmation at the district public health laboratory continues. A total of 13 samples were confirmed by laboratory analysis (culture) as of 26 April 2022.\u2022 Efforts to collaborate with the Mozambique team are underway through the regional coordination in the East, Central and South Africa.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Cholera is endemic in Malawi with seasonal outbreaks being reported from 1998 to 2020. The Southern region, which shares border with Mozambique, remains the hotspot of the recurrent cholera outbreaks. The detection of cholera cases is concerning as Malawi has low population immunity in the districts reporting confirmed cases.The main factors attributed to the initiation and ongoing spread of the cholera epidemics in the two affected districts include:\u2022 Tropical storm and floods\u2022 Inadequate hygiene and sanitation\u00a0 \u00a0\u2022 Limited access to safe drinking water and personal hygiene practices\u2022 Open defecation\u2022 Delay in seeking careOther identified challenges from Nsanje and neighbouring at-risk districts (Balaka and Chikwawa) include poor capacity for sample collection, transportation, and diagnosis in the affected areas mainly due to the difficult access following floods.\u00a0Additionally, Malawi shares international borders with Mozambique, and there is frequent and substantial cross-border population movement, including people displaced following the floods caused by the tropical cyclone. This poses a risk of cross-border transmission of cholera.Close monitoring of the situation with active cross-border coordination and information sharing remains crucial.",
        "WHO Advice": "Prevention and control: WHO recommends improving access to clean water and sanitation, good waste management, food safety practices and hygienic practices to prevent the transmission of cholera. OCV should be used in combination with improvements in water and sanitation to control cholera outbreaks and for prevention in areas known to be at-high risk for cholera.Surveillance: Strengthening surveillance, particularly at the community level, is advised. There is a need to ensure that countries are ready to quickly detect and respond to this cholera outbreak to reduce the risk of spread to new areas. As the outbreak is occurring in border areas where there is significant cross border movement, WHO encourages the respective countries to ensure cooperation and regular information sharing.Case management: Appropriate case management, including improving access to care, should be implemented in outbreak-affected areas to reduce mortality.International travel and Trade: WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel and trade to and from Malawi.",

        "Outbreak name": "Yellow Fever",
        "Date Reported": "25 April 2022",
        "Location": "Uganda",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 6 March 2022, WHO received notification from the Uganda Ministry of Health of four suspected yellow fever cases. As of 25 April 2022, a total of seven suspected cases tested positive for yellow fever antibodies by plaque reduction neutralization test. However, further investigations identified only one laboratory confirmed case of yellow fever reported from Wakiso district, Central Region. The MoH declared an outbreak, and a rapid response team was deployed to the affected districts. Due to the potential of epidemic spread in Uganda and the risk of spread to neighboring countries, WHO assesses the risk to be high at the national and regional levels.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 6 March 2022, the Uganda Ministry of Health (MoH) notified WHO of four suspected yellow fever cases, with specimens collected between 2 January and 18 February 2022, which tested positive for yellow fever antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) at the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI). As of 25 March 2022, three additional samples, with specimens collected between 1 \u2013 13 October 2021, tested positive for antibodies by PRNT at the UVRI. All the seven suspected cases tested negative by Polymerase Chain Reaction.Cases presented with symptoms including fever, vomiting, nausea, diarrhoea, intense fatigue, anorexia, abdominal pain, chest pain, muscle pain, headache, and sore throat. None of the cases presented with severe yellow fever symptoms of acute jaundice.The majority of the suspected cases were females (n=6) with an age range between 15 to 57 years. Five were reported from Wakiso district, and one each from Masaka and Kasese districts.Of the seven suspected cases, epidemiological investigations were conducted for six cases, and investigation is pending on one case. As of 25 April 2022, five of the six cases investigated had a recent history of vaccination and were consequently discarded in the absence of evidence suggesting vaccination failure, and one case (reported from Wakiso district) was confirmed as yellow fever.",
        "Epidemiology": "Yellow fever is an epidemic-prone mosquito-borne vaccine preventable disease caused by an arbovirus transmitted to humans by the bites of infected\u00a0Aedes\u00a0and\u00a0Haemagogus\u00a0mosquitoes. Once contracted, the yellow fever virus incubates in the body for 3 to 6 days. The majority of infections are asymptomatic, but when symptoms occur, the most common are fever, muscle pain with prominent backache, headache, loss of appetite, and nausea or vomiting. In most cases, symptoms disappear after 3 to 4 days.A small proportion of patients, however, can have more severe symptoms of high-grade fever, abdominal pain with vomiting, jaundice and dark urine caused by acute liver and kidney failure. Death could occur within 7 - 10 days in about half of the patients with severe symptoms. There is currently no specific anti-viral drug for yellow fever, but early supportive treatment, such as specific care to treat dehydration, fever, and liver and kidney failure could improve survival rates. \u00a0Forty countries globally, 27 in Africa and 13 in Central and South America are classified as high-risk for yellow fever. Since September 2021, 13 countries in the WHO African Region have reported probable and confirmed yellow fever cases and outbreaks, including an ongoing outbreak under close investigation in neighbouring Kenya. These outbreaks are occurring in large geographic areas of the Western, Central and Eastern regions of Africa. They have affected areas that have previously conducted large-scale mass vaccination campaigns but with persistent and growing gaps in immunity due to lack of sustained population immunity through routine immunization and/or secondary to population movements (newcomers without history of vaccination). These reports indicate a resurgence and intensified transmission of the yellow fever virus.",
        "Public Health Response": "After the Uganda MoH declared a yellow fever outbreak in the country they activated the Public Health Emergency Operation center. They are also deploying a rapid response team to affected districts where all cases were reported to determine the extent of the outbreak, identify the at-risk population, conduct a risk assessment, initiate risk communication and community engagement activities and implement integrated vector control measures.Yellow fever vaccine has not been introduced into the Uganda routine immunization schedule; however, the country has an imminent plan to introduce it in mid-2022, followed by phased mass vaccination campaigns (PMVCs). Pending the evolution of the situation and response planning, a request maybe submitted to the International Coordinating Group (ICG) on vaccine provision for preventive yellow fever vaccination in areas as indicated by ongoing investigations.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Uganda is endemic for yellow fever and is classified as a high-risk country in the Eliminate Yellow Fever Epidemics (EYE) Strategy. The country has history of outbreaks reported in 2020 (Buliisa, Maracha and Moyo districts), 2019 (Masaka and Koboko districts), 2016 (Masaka, Rukungiri, and Kalangala districts) and in 2010 when ten districts were affected in Northern Uganda.The confirmed case is reported from Wakiso district, close to the greater Kampala metropolitan area. The district also includes Entebbe, where the international airport is located.Uganda has not introduced the yellow fever vaccine into routine immunization and the estimated overall population immunity is low (4.2%), and attributable to past reactive vaccination activities supported by ICG in focal districts including Yumbe, Moyo, Buliisa, Maracha, Koboko (2020), Masaka, and Koboko (2019), in limited scope in the Greater Kampala area (2017), Masaka, Rukungiri, and Kalangala districts (2016).Epidemic spread of yellow fever is a risk in Uganda as there could be onward amplification if the virus is introduced in crowded urban areas that are known hubs for travel. There is the risk for further amplification and international spread because of frequent population movements (e.g., between Uganda, Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan), coupled with the low population immunity in some neighbouring countries.The recurrent outbreaks indicate the ongoing risk of zoonotic spill over of yellow fever and risk for disease amplification in both rural and densely settled urban areas in the largely unimmunized population. Despite the yellow fever vaccine being highly effective (99% effective within 30 days of vaccination), the risk of breakthrough cases exists. \u00a0These cases should be investigated to identify and address possible causes of vaccine failure.Considering the above-described scenario, the risk is assessed as high at the national and regional levels, and low at the global level.WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and review the risk assessment based on the latest available information.",
        "WHO Advice": "Surveillance: WHO recommends close monitoring of the situation with active cross-border coordination and information sharing, due to the possibility of cases in neighbouring countries, the presence of a yellow fever outbreak in neighbouring Kenya, and the risk of onward spread. Enhanced surveillance with investigation and laboratory testing of suspect cases is also recommended.Vaccination: Vaccination is the primary means for prevention and control of yellow fever. Completion of the nation-wide population protection through vaccination will help avert the risk of future outbreaks. WHO supports the plan of the Uganda Ministry of Health to introduce the yellow fever vaccine into the national routine immunization schedule, as well as the following implementation of phased mass vaccination campaigns.Vector control: In urban centres, targeted vector control measures are also helpful to interrupt transmission. As a general precaution, WHO recommends avoidance of mosquito bites including the use of repellents and insecticide treated mosquito nets. The highest risk for transmission of yellow fever virus is during the day and early evening. Risk communication: WHO encourages its Member States to take all actions necessary to keep travellers well informed of risks and preventive measures including vaccination. Travellers should be made aware of yellow fever symptoms and signs and instructed to rapidly seek medical advice if presenting signs and symptoms suggestive of yellow fever infection. Infected returning travellers may pose a risk for the establishment of local cycles of yellow fever transmission in areas where a competent vector is present.International travel and trade: WHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions on Uganda. Yellow fever vaccination is required by national authorities for international travellers over one year of age entering Uganda.In accordance with the IHR (2005) third edition, the international certificate of vaccination against yellow fever becomes valid 10 days after vaccination and the validity extends throughout the life of the person vaccinated. A single dose of WHO approved yellow fever vaccine is sufficient to confer sustained immunity and life-long protection against yellow fever disease. A booster dose of the vaccine is not needed and is not required of international travellers as a condition of entry.",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "Please note that this Disease Outbreak News has been revised to correct the WHO working case definition that was published on 23 April 2022.\n\ufeffSince the WHO Disease Outbreak News on Acute hepatitis of unknown aetiology \u2013 the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was published on 15 April 2022, there have been continuing further reports of cases of acute hepatitis of unknown origin among young children. It is not yet clear if there has been an increase in hepatitis cases, or an increase in awareness of hepatitis cases that occur at the expected rate but go undetected. While adenovirus is a possible hypothesis, investigations are ongoing for the causative agent.",
        "Description of the Situation": "As of 21 April 2022, at least 169 cases of acute hepatitis of unknown origin have been reported from 11 countries in the WHO European Region and one country in the WHO Region of the Americas (Figure 1). Cases have been reported in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (the United Kingdom) (114), Spain (13), Israel (12), the United States of America (9), Denmark (6), Ireland (<5), The Netherlands (4), Italy (4), Norway (2), France (2), Romania (1), and Belgium (1).Figure 1. Distribution of cases of acute severe hepatitis of unknown origin by country, as of 23 April 2022.Cases are aged 1 month to 16 years old. Seventeen children (approximately 10%) have required liver transplantation; at least one death has been reported.The clinical syndrome among identified cases is acute hepatitis (liver inflammation) with markedly elevated liver enzymes. Many cases reported gastrointestinal symptoms including abdominal pain, diarrhoea and vomiting preceding presentation with severe acute hepatitis, and increased levels of liver enzymes (aspartate transaminase (AST) or alanine aminotransaminase (ALT) greater the 500 IU/L) and jaundice. Most cases did not have a fever. The common viruses that cause acute viral hepatitis (hepatitis viruses A, B, C, D and E) have not been detected in any of these cases.\u00a0 International travel or links to other countries based on the currently available information have not been identified as factors.Adenovirus has been detected in at least 74 cases, and of the number of cases with information on molecular testing, 18 have been identified as F type 41. SARS-CoV-2 was identified in 20 cases of those that were tested. Furthermore, 19 were detected with a SARS-CoV-2 and adenovirus co-infection.The United Kingdom, where the majority of cases have been reported to date, has recently observed a significant increase in adenovirus infections in the community (particularly detected in faecal samples in children) following low levels of circulation earlier in the COVID-19 pandemic. The Netherlands also reported concurrent increasing community adenovirus circulation.Nevertheless, due to enhanced laboratory testing for adenovirus, this could represent the identification of an existing rare outcome occurring at levels not previously detected that is now being recognized due to increased testing.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "Further investigations are ongoing in countries that have identified cases and include more detailed clinical and exposure histories, toxicology testing (i.e. environmental and food toxicity testing), and additional virological/microbiological tests. Affected countries have also initiated enhanced surveillance activities.WHO and ECDC are supporting countries with the ongoing investigations and collecting information from the countries reporting cases. All available information is further disseminated by countries through their Hepatitis Networks and clinical organisations such as the European Association for the Study of the Liver, the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) and The European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN).For cases in Europe, joint WHO/ECDC data collection will be established using The European Surveillance System (TESSy).Guidance derived by the United Kingdom Health Security Agency has been issued to affected countries to support a thorough investigation of suspected cases.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "The United Kingdom first reported an unexpected significant increase in cases of severe acute hepatitis of unknown origin in young, generally previously healthy children. An unexpected increase of such cases has now been reported by several other countries \u2013 notably Ireland and the Netherlands.While adenovirus is currently one hypothesis as the underlying cause, it does not fully explain the severity of the clinical picture. Infection with adenovirus type 41, the implicated adenovirus type, has not previously been linked to such a clinical presentation. Adenoviruses are common pathogens that usually cause self-limited infections. They spread from person-to-person and most commonly cause respiratory illness, but depending on the type, can also cause other illnesses such as gastroenteritis (inflammation of the stomach or intestines), conjunctivitis (pink eye), and cystitis (bladder infection). There are more than 50 types of immunologically distinct adenoviruses that can cause infections in humans. Adenovirus type 41 typically presents as diarrhea, vomiting, and fever, often accompanied by respiratory symptoms. While there have been case reports of hepatitis in immunocompromised children with adenovirus infection, adenovirus type 41 is not known to be a cause of hepatitis in otherwise healthy children.Factors such as increased susceptibility amongst young children following a lower level of circulation of adenovirus during the COVID-19 pandemic, the potential emergence of a novel adenovirus, as well as SARS-CoV-2 co-infection, need to be further investigated. Hypotheses related to side effects from the COVID-19 vaccines are currently not supported as the vast majority of affected children did not receive COVID-19 vaccination. Other infectious and non-infectious explanations need to be excluded to fully assess and manage the risk.With continued new notifications of recent onset cases, at least in the United Kingdom, together with more extensive case searching, it is very likely that more cases will be detected before the cause can be confirmed and more specific control and prevention measures can be implemented.WHO is closely monitoring the situation and working with the United Kingdom health authorities, other Member States and partners.",
        "WHO Advice": "Further work is required to identify additional cases, both in currently affected countries and elsewhere. The priority is to determine the cause of these cases to further refine control and prevention actions. Common prevention measures for adenovirus and other common infections involve regular hand washing and respiratory hygiene.Member States are strongly encouraged to identify, investigate and report potential cases fitting the case definition1. Epidemiological and risk factor information should be collected and submitted by Member States to WHO and partner agencies through agreed reporting mechanisms. Any epidemiological links between or among the cases might provide clues for tracking the source of illness. Temporal and geographical information about the cases, as well as their close contacts should be reviewed for potential risk factors.WHO recommends that testing of blood (with initial anecdotal experience that whole blood is more sensitive than serum), serum, urine, stool, and respiratory samples, as well as liver biopsy samples (when available) should be undertaken, with further virus characterization including sequencing. Other infectious and non-infectious causes need to be thoroughly investigated.WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel and/or trade with the United Kingdom, or any other country where cases are identified, based on the currently available information.1WHO working case definition:Confirmed:\u00a0N/A at presentProbable:\u00a0A person presenting with an acute hepatitis (non hepA-E*) with serum transaminase >500 IU/L (AST or ALT), who is 16 years and younger, since 1 October 2021Epi-linked: A person presenting with an acute hepatitis\u00a0(non hepA-E*)\u00a0of any age who is a close contact of a probable case, since 1 October 2021.*If hepatitis A-E serology results are awaited, but other criteria met, these can be reported\u00a0and will be classified as \u201cpending classification\u201d.

        "Location": "the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 5 April 2022, WHO was notified of 10 cases of severe acute hepatitis of unknown aetiology in children under the age of 10 years, across central Scotland. By 8 April, 74 cases had been identified in the United Kingdom. Hepatitis viruses (A, B, C, E, and D where applicable) have been excluded after laboratory testing while further investigations are ongoing to understand the aetiology of these cases. Given the increase in cases reported over the past one month and enhanced case search activities, more cases are likely to be reported in the coming days.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 5 April 2022, the International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Point (NFP) for the United Kingdom notified WHO of 10 cases of severe acute hepatitis of unknown aetiology in previously healthy young children (age range: 11 months to five-year-old) across central Scotland. Of these 10 cases, nine had onset of symptoms in March 2022 while one case had an onset of symptoms in January 2022. Symptoms included jaundice, diarrhoea, vomiting and abdominal pain. All 10 cases were detected when hospitalised.As of 8 April 2022, further investigations across the United Kingdom have identified a total of 74 cases (including the 10 cases) fulfilling the case definition1.\u00a0The clinical syndrome in identified cases is of acute hepatitis with markedly elevated liver enzymes, often with jaundice, sometimes preceded by gastrointestinal symptoms, in children principally up to 10 years old. Some cases have required transfer to specialist children\u2019s liver units and six children have undergone liver transplantation. As of 11 April, no death has been reported among these cases and one epidemiologically linked case has been detected.Laboratory testing has excluded hepatitis type A, B, C, and E viruses (and D where applicable) in these cases while Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and/or adenovirus have been detected in several cases. The United Kingdom has recently observed an increase in adenovirus activity, which is co-circulating with SARS-CoV-2, though the role of these viruses in the pathogenesis (mechanism by which disease develops) is not yet clear. No other epidemiological risk factors have been identified to date, including recent international travel. Overall, the aetiology of the current hepatitis cases is still considered unknown and remains under active investigation. Laboratory testing for additional infections, chemicals and toxins is underway for the identified cases.Following the notification from the UK, less than five cases (confirmed or possible) have been reported in Ireland, further investigations into these are ongoing. Additionally, three confirmed cases of acute hepatitis of unknown aetiology have been reported in children (age range 22-month-old to 13-year-old) in Spain. The national authorities are currently investigating these cases.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "Clinical and public health response has been implemented across the United Kingdom to coordinate case finding with investigation into the cause of illness in these cases.  Further investigations by the national authorities are ongoing to include more detailed exposure history, toxicology testing, and additional virological/microbiological tests. Guidance has been issued to experts to support a thorough investigation of suspected cases. Further investigations and a clinical and public health response to the cases reported are also being undertaken in Ireland and Spain.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "The United Kingdom has reported a recent unexpected significant increase in cases of severe acute hepatitis of unknown aetiology in young children. Although the potential role of adenovirus and/or SARS-CoV-2 in the pathogenesis of these cases is one hypothesis, other infectious and non-infectious factors need to be fully investigated to properly assess and manage the risk.As there is an on-going increasing trend in cases in the United Kingdom over the past month together with more extensive case searching, it is very likely that more cases will be detected before the aetiology has been found (either biological, chemical or other agent(s)) and corresponding appropriate control and prevention measures have been taken. WHO is closely monitoring the situation with other Member States and the United Kingdom and partners for cases with similar profiles.",
        "WHO Advice": "Further work is required to identify cases both inside the United Kingdom and internationally. The priority is to determine the aetiology of these cases to guide further clinical and public health actions. Any epidemiological links between or among the cases might provide indications for tracking the source of illness. Temporal and geographical information of the cases, as well as their contacts should be reviewed for potential risk factors.While some cases tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and/or adenovirus, genetic characterization of viruses should be undertaken to determine any potential associations between cases.\u00a0\u00a0 Member States are strongly encouraged to identify, investigate and report potential cases fitting the case definition.International travel and trade: WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel and/or trade with the United Kingdom, or any other country where cases are identified, based on the currently available information.",

        "Location": "Germany",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 11 May 2022, Germany\u202fnotified WHO of one laboratory-confirmed human case of infection with a swine-origin influenza A(H1N1) virus\u202fin North Rhine-Westphalia, in the west of Germany. The case was detected during routine sentinel surveillance for influenza. No further cases have been reported in connection to this case and the patient has fully recovered. Although infections with A(H1N1) variant viruses occasionally occur, it is still considered a rare and unusual event.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 11 May 2022, Germany notified WHO of one laboratory-confirmed human case of infection with a swine-origin influenza A(H1N1) virus in North Rhine-Westphalia state, Germany. The case is an adult aged 30-40 years, who was detected during routine sentinel surveillance for influenza. On 21 March, the case developed influenza-like illness symptoms including fever, cough, sore throat, headache and muscle pain. On 24 March, a nasal swab sample was collected, and on 29 March, influenza A virus was detected.\u00a0\u00a0The sample was tested at the National Influenza Centre at the Robert Koch Institute in Germany. Influenza A virus was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). On 5 May, whole genome sequencing pointed to a Eurasian avian-like swine A(H1N1) virus. Further virus characterization is underway.\u00a0The case was not hospitalized and has since recovered. Although the case had no direct contact with swine, the individual lived in a region with many swine farms and had contacts who were swine farmers.",
        "Epidemiology": "Influenza A(H1) viruses are enzootic in swine populations in most regions of the world. Human cases of infection with swine influenza viruses have sporadically been detected in several countries in Europe in recent years, of whom most had reported exposure to swine.\u00a0 Influenza A viruses in swine do not usually infect humans because influenza viruses that infect pigs may be different from human influenza viruses. Thus, influenza vaccines made against human influenza viruses are generally not expected to protect people from influenza viruses that normally circulate in pigs. When an influenza virus that normally circulates in swine is detected in a person, it is called a \u201cvariant influenza virus\u201d. Sporadic human infections with variant viruses have been reported, usually after direct or indirect exposure to pigs or contaminated environments. Human infections with variant viruses tend to result in mild clinical illness, although some cases have been hospitalized with more severe disease and some have been fatal.\u00a0\u00a0There have been several influenza A(H1) virus infections detected in Europe in recent years. Although infections with A(H1N1) variant virus occasionally occur, it is still considered a rare and unusual event.",
        "Public Health Response": "The German health authorities contacted family members of the case and offered serological tests to close contacts, including a circle of friends who are in the farming community. Authorities are also conducting retrospective epidemiological investigation. No other measures were implemented by the German authorities because the case has recovered and there is currently no evidence of ongoing transmission.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Based on currently available information, this is a sporadic case and there is no evidence of disease spread so far. WHO assesses the risk to the general population posed by this virus to be low and the risk to occupationally exposed persons to be low-to-moderate. As the investigations are still being conducted by the national authority, the risk level will be amended accordingly if warranted.\u00a0Pigs are susceptible to avian, human and swine influenza viruses; they potentially may be infected with influenza viruses from different species at the same time. If this happens, it is possible for the genes of these viruses to mix and create a new virus. This type of major change in the influenza A viruses is known as antigenic shift. If this new virus causes illness in people and can be transmitted easily from person-to-person with no population immunity, an influenza pandemic may occur.\u00a0Should individuals infected with a variant influenza virus travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during travel or after arrival. If this were to occur, further community level spread is considered unlikely as this virus has not acquired the ability to transmit easily among humans.",
        "WHO Advice": "Surveillance:\u00a0\u00a0This case does not change the current WHO recommendations on public health measures and surveillance of seasonal influenza.\u00a0WHO does not advise special traveler screening at points of entry or restrictions with regard to the current situation of influenza viruses at the human-animal interface.\u00a0Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect virological, epidemiological and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health and timely virus sharing for risk assessment.\u00a0Notification and investigation:\u00a0\u00a0All human infections caused by a novel influenza subtype are notifiable under the International Health Regulations (IHR) and State Parties to the IHR (2005) are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic. Evidence of illness is not required.\u00a0In the case of a confirmed or suspected human infection caused by a novel influenza virus with pandemic potential, including a variant virus, a thorough epidemiologic investigation of history of exposure to animals, of travel, and contact tracing should be conducted. The epidemiologic investigation should include early identification of unusual respiratory events that could signal person-to-person transmission of the novel virus. Clinical samples collected from the time and place that the case occurred should be tested and sent to a WHO Collaboration Center for further characterization.\u00a0Travel and trade:\u00a0\u00a0WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel and/or trade for Germany based on the currently available information.\u00a0\u00a0Prevention measures for travelers:\u00a0\u00a0Travelers to countries with known outbreaks of animal influenza should avoid farms, contact with animals in live animal markets, entering areas where animals may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with animal feces. Travelers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travelers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.",

        "Date Reported": "18 May 2022",
        "Location": "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 13 May 2022, WHO was notified of two laboratory confirmed cases and one probable case of monkeypox, from the same household, in the United Kingdom. On 15 May, four additional laboratory confirmed cases have been reported amongst Sexual Health Services attendees presenting with a vesicular rash illness in men who have sex with men (MSM).\nAs response measures, an incident team has been established to coordinate contact tracing efforts.\nIn contrast to sporadic cases with travel links to endemic countries (see Disease outbreak news on Monkeypox in the United Kingdom published on 16 May 2022), no source of infection has been confirmed yet. Based on currently available information, infection seems to have been locally acquired in the United Kingdom. The extent of local transmission is unclear at this stage and there is the possibility of identification of further cases.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 13 May 2022, the United Kingdom notified WHO of two laboratory confirmed cases and one probable case of monkeypox to WHO. All three cases belong to the same family.\u00a0The probable case is epidemiologically linked to the two confirmed cases and has fully recovered. The first case identified (index case) developed a rash on 5 May and was admitted to hospital in London, the United Kingdom on 6 May. On 9 May, the case was transferred to a specialist infectious disease centre for ongoing care. Monkeypox was confirmed on 12 May. Another confirmed case developed a vesicular rash on 30 April, confirmed to have monkeypox on 13 May, and is in a stable condition.\u00a0The West African clade of monkeypox was identified in the two confirmed cases using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR) on vesicle swabs on 12 May and 13 May.\u00a0On 15 May, WHO was notified of four additional laboratory confirmed cases, all identified among MSM attending Sexual Health Services and presenting with a vesicular rash. All four were confirmed to have the West African clade of the monkeypox virus.",
        "Epidemiology": "Monkeypox is a sylvatic zoonosis with incidental human infections that usually occur in forested parts of Central and West Africa. It is caused by the monkeypox virus which belongs to the orthopoxvirus family. Monkeypox can be transmitted by droplet exposure via exhaled large droplets and by contact with infected skin lesions or contaminated materials. The incubation period of monkeypox is usually from 6 to 13 days but can range from 5 to 21 days.\u00a0 The disease is often self-limiting with symptoms usually resolving spontaneously within 14 to 21 days. Symptoms can be mild or severe, and lesions can be very itchy or painful. The animal reservoir remains unknown, although is likely to be among rodents. Contact with live and dead animals through hunting and consumption of wild game or bush meat are known risk factors.There are two clades of monkeypox virus: the West African clade and Congo Basin (Central African) clade. Although the West African clade of monkeypox virus infection sometimes leads to severe illness in some individuals, disease is usually self-limiting. The case fatality ratio for the West African clade has been documented to be around 1%, whereas for the Congo Basin clade, it may be as high as 10%. Children are also at higher risk, and monkeypox during pregnancy may lead to complications, congenital monkeypox or stillbirth.Milder cases of monkeypox may go undetected and represent a risk of person-to-person transmission. There is likely to be little immunity to the infection in those travelling or otherwise exposed, as endemic disease is normally geographically limited to parts of West and Central Africa. Historically, vaccination against smallpox was shown to be protective against monkeypox. While one vaccine (MVA-BN) and one specific treatment (tecovirimat) were approved for monkeypox, in 2019 and 2022 respectively, these countermeasures are not yet widely available, and populations worldwide under the age of 40 or 50 years no longer benefit from the protection afforded by prior smallpox vaccination programmes.",
        "Public Health Response": "Health authorities in the United Kingdom have established an incident management team to coordinate the extensive contact tracing which is currently underway in health care settings and the community for those who have had contact with the confirmed cases. Contacts are being assessed based on their level of exposure and followed up through active or passive surveillance for 21 days from the date of last exposure to a case. Vaccination is being offered to higher risk contacts.A detailed backwards contact tracing investigation is also being carried out to determine the likely route of acquisition and establish whether there are any further chains of transmission within the United Kingdom for all cases. Sexual contacts and venues visited are actively being investigated for the four recent cases.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "No source of infection has yet been confirmed for either the family or MSM clusters. Based on currently available information, infection seems to have been locally acquired in the United Kingdom. The extent of local transmission is unclear at this stage and there is the possibility of identification of further cases. However, once monkeypox was suspected, authorities in the United Kingdom promptly initiated appropriate public health measures, including isolation of the cases and extensive forward and backward contact tracing to enable source identification.In the United Kingdom, there have been eight previous cases of monkeypox reported: all importations were related to a travel history to or from Nigeria. In 2021, there were also two separate human monkeypox cases imported from Nigeria reported by the United States of America. During an outbreak of monkeypox in humans in 2003 in the United States of America, exposure was traced to contact with pet prairie dogs that had been co-housed with monkeypoxvirus-infected small mammals imported from Ghana.",
        "WHO Advice": "Intensive public health measures should continue in the United Kingdom. In addition to the ongoing forward and backward contact tracing and source tracing, case searching, and local rash-illness surveillance should be strengthened in the MSM and wider community, as well as in primary and secondary health care settings. Any patient with suspected monkeypox should be investigated and isolated with supportive care during the presumed and known infectious periods, that is, during the prodromal and rash stages of the illness, respectively. Timely contact tracing, surveillance measures and raising awareness among health care providers, including sexual health and dermatology clinics, are essential for preventing further secondary cases and effective management of the current outbreak. Additionally, deployment of pharmaceutical countermeasures under investigational protocols can be considered.Health workers and other care givers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed monkeypox should implement standard, contact and droplet infection control precautions. Samples taken from people with suspected monkeypox or animals with suspected monkeypox virus infection should be safely handled by trained staff working in suitably equipped laboratories.\u00a0Any illness during travel or upon return from an endemic area should be reported to a health professional, including information about all recent travel and immunization history. Residents and travellers to endemic countries should avoid contact with sick animals (dead or alive) that could harbour monkeypox virus (rodents, marsupials, primates) and should refrain from eating or handling wild game (bush meat). The importance of hand hygiene by using soap and water or alcohol-based sanitizer should be emphasized.International travel or trade: WHO does not recommend any restriction for travel to and trade with the United Kingdom based on available information at this time.WHO continue to closely monitor as the situation is evolving rapidly.",

        "Date Reported": "17 May 2022",
        "Location": "Oman",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "On 28 April 2022, WHO was notified of a case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), in a 34-year-old male, from Al Dhahira Governorate in Oman. The case had a history of direct contact with animals including dromedaries, sheep and goats at his family farm in Oman. The condition of the case remains critically unstable. As of 28 April, a total of six close community and 27 health care workers had been listed as contacts and were followed for 14 days from the date of last exposure with the case. No secondary cases have been reported to date.",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 28 April 2022, the National IHR Focal point of Oman notified WHO of one case of MERS-CoV from Al Dhahira Governorate in Oman.The case, a 34-year-old male, non-health care worker who is a resident of Al Dhahira Governorate, developed symptoms including shortness of breath, high-grade fever, and dry cough on 18 April which lasted for six days. On 24 April, he was taken to the emergency department of a hospital. Upon examination and assessment, he was found to be in severe respiratory distress, febrile, and hypotensive and diagnosed with clinical pneumonia with fluid collection in the lungs and was admitted to the isolation ward. The condition of the patient deteriorated, and he was immediately transferred to a negative pressure isolation room, in the medical ward on the same day. On 25 April, his condition worsened, and he was then transferred to an isolation room in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and placed on mechanical ventilation. Respiratory samples were tested for several viral pathogens, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. A sepsis workup including blood and urine tests was performed and tested positive for MERS-CoV by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on 27 April.\u00a0As of 8 May, the condition of the patient remains critically unstable and he continues to be mechanically ventilated in an isolation room in the ICU. The patient has no known co-morbidities. There was no history of contact with similar cases, no history of travel nor previous hospitalization. However, the patient has a history of direct contact with animals including dromedaries, sheep and goats at his family farm in Oman.",
        "Epidemiology": "Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory infection that is caused by a coronavirus called Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease resulting in high mortality. Approximately 35% of patients with MERS have died, but this may be an overestimate of the true mortality rate, as mild cases of MERS-CoV may be missed by existing surveillance systems and until more is known about the disease, the case fatality rates are counted only amongst the laboratory-confirmed cases.Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedary camels who are the natural host and zoonotic source of the MERS-CoV infection. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts and in health care settings. Outside of the healthcare setting there has been limited human-to-human transmission.MERS-CoV infections range from showing no symptoms (asymptomatic) or mild respiratory symptoms to severe acute respiratory disease and death. A typical presentation of MERS-CoV disease is fever, cough and shortness of breath. Pneumonia is a common finding, but not always present. Gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhoea, have also been reported. Severe illness can cause respiratory failure that requires mechanical ventilation and support in an intensive care unit. The virus appears to cause more severe disease in older people, persons with weakened immune systems and those with chronic diseases such as renal disease, cancer, chronic lung disease, and diabetes.No vaccine or specific treatment is currently available, although several MERS-CoV specific vaccines and treatments are in development. Treatment is supportive and based on the patient\u2019s clinical condition.",
        "Public Health Response": "As of 28 April, a total of six close community and 27 health care workers were listed as contacts and followed up for 14 days from the last date of exposure to the MERS-CoV patient. All high-risk contacts, such as healthcare workers, were monitored for symptoms and screened for MERS CoV by RT-PCR as per the Ministry of Health Infection Prevention and Control guideline for MERS-COV exposures and cases. No secondary cases have been reported to date from Oman.\u00a0 \u00a0Infection, prevention and control (IPC)measures were implemented in the hospital where the patient was admitted.\u00a0\u00a0Healthcare workers were educated on MERS and a refresher training course on IPC measures was provided.Family members identified as close contacts of the case were educated on personal and respiratory hygiene to prevent further transmission\u00a0The Ministry of Agriculture has investigated the farms of the patient\u2019s family and close relatives; samples from the dromedaries have been collected for testing. As of 8 May 2022, results remain pending.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Cases of MERS-CoV infection are rare in Oman. Since June 2013, a total of 25 MERS-CoV cases, including the current case, and seven deaths, have been reported to WHO from Oman.As of 15 May 2022, the total number of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection cases reported globally to WHO is 2591 including 894 associated deaths. The majority of the reported cases have occurred in countries in the Arabian Peninsula. Outside of this region, there has been one large outbreak in the Republic of Korea, in May 2015, during which 186 laboratory-confirmed cases (185 in Republic of Korea and 1 in China) and 38 deaths were reported. The global number reflects the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths reported to WHO under International Health Regulations (2005) to date.The notification of this case does not change the overall risk assessment for MERS. It is expected that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East and/or other countries where MERS-CoV is circulating in dromedaries, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who were exposed to the virus through contact with dromedaries or their products (for example, consumption of camel\u2019s raw milk), or in a healthcare setting.\u00a0WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts a risk assessment based on the latest available information.",
        "WHO Advice": "Surveillance: Based on the current situation and available information, WHO re-emphasizes the importance of strong surveillance by all Member States for acute respiratory infections, including MERS-CoV, and to carefully review any unusual patterns.Infection prevention and control in health care settings: Human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV in healthcare settings has been associated with delays in recognizing the early symptoms of MERS-CoV infection, slow triage of suspected cases and delays in implementing IPC measures. IPC measures are therefore critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV between people, particularly in health care facilities.\u00a0Healthcare workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, at every interaction in healthcare settings:\u2022 Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection.\u2022 Contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection.\u2022 Airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol-generating procedures or in settings where aerosol-generating procedures are conducted.Case management: Early identification, case management and isolation of cases, quarantine of contacts, together with appropriate infection prevention and control measures in health care settings and public health awareness can prevent human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV.MERS-CoV appears to cause more severe disease in people with underlying chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons. Therefore, people with these underlying medical conditions should avoid close contact with animals, particularly dromedary camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. Timely, effective, and safe supportive management of patients with MERS should be provided, particularly for those at risk of more severe disease.\u00a0Infection prevention and control in the community: General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to. Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.International travel and trade: WHO does not advise specific MERS-CoV screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 9 February 2022, WHO was notified by the United Kingdom health authorities of two laboratory confirmed cases and one probable case of Lassa fever. As of 18 February, three cases have been confirmed and one death has been reported. These are the first reported Lassa fever cases in the United Kingdom since 2009, and represents the second known case of secondary transmission of Lassa fever in Europe.The first case travelled to Mali in late 2021, where Lassa fever is endemic. After returning to the United Kingdom, the individual developed symptoms of fever, fatigue and loose stool, and was subsequently hospitalized. The first case has now recovered. The second and third cases were family members of the first case and did not travel to Mali. Both were admitted to the hospital and the third case has sadly died.On 8 February, samples from both the first and second cases were laboratory confirmed positive for Lassa virus by PCR. The third case was initially provided care as a probable case of Lassa fever and the diagnosis was confirmed on 9 February.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "Incident responses have been activated by health authorities in the United Kingdom to coordinate the clinical and public health management of these cases.People with exposure to the cases were identified through robust contact tracing activities. Low and high risk contacts are being followed up for 21 days after their last exposure. Post-exposure prophylaxis has been offered to high-risk contacts with the most significant exposures. Systems are in place to assess and manage any contacts who may develop symptoms during the follow up period.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Lassa fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic fever illness that is primarily transmitted to humans via contact with food or household items contaminated with infected Mastomys rats\u2019 urine or faeces. Human-to-human transmission is rare but can occur through direct contact with the blood, urine, faeces, or other bodily secretions, particularly in health care settings. It can cause severe disease in about 20% of patients. The case fatality ratio (CFR) is 1% overall and 15% in severely ill patients. Early recognition and initiation of patient care decrease the CFR and public health impact.Lassa fever is endemic in Mali and sporadic cases have been exported to Europe from countries in West Africa where the disease is endemic, such as Sierra Leone, Togo, Liberia and Nigeria in recent years. However, the secondary transmission of Lassa fever through human contacts is known to be extremely rare when appropriate infection prevention and control precautions and laboratory biosafety measures are applied. The only secondary transmission of Lassa fever reported in Europe was in 2016 from Germany, when the secondary case performed post-mortem care of a fatal case.Human-to-human transmission occurs in both community and health care settings, where the virus may be spread by contaminated medical equipment, such as reused needles, as well as direct contact with bodily secretions. Health care workers are at risk if caring for Lassa fever patients in the absence of appropriate infection prevention and control (IPC) practices, although information from recent imported cases in Europe show that secondary transmission of Lassa virus is rare when standard IPC precautions are followed. The possibility of additional secondary cases related to transmission in a health care setting cannot currently be excluded, but is considered very unlikely in the community.",
        "WHO Advice": "Prevention of Lassa fever in endemic countries relies on community engagement and promoting hygienic conditions to discourage rodents from entering homes. Family members and health care workers should always be careful to avoid contact with blood and body fluids while caring for sick individuals.In health care settings, staff should consistently implement standard IPC measures when caring for patients to prevent nosocomial infections. Health care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed Lassa virus, or handling their clinical specimens, should reinforce standard and contact precautions, comprising appropriate hand hygiene, rational use of personal protective equipment (PPE), environmental cleaning, isolation, safe injections practices and safe burial practices. In order to avoid any direct contact with blood and body fluids and/or splashes onto facial mucosa (eyes, nose, mouth) when providing direct care for a patient with suspected or confirmed Lassa virus, personal protective equipment should include: 1) clean non-sterile gloves; 2) clean, non-sterile fluid resistant gown; and 3) protection of facial mucosa against splashes (mask and eye protection, or a face shield).Given the nonspecific presentation of viral haemorrhagic fevers, isolation of ill travellers and consistent implementation of standard and contact precautions is key to preventing secondary transmission. When consistently applied, these measures can prevent secondary transmission even if travel history information is not obtained, not immediately available, or the diagnosis of a viral haemorrhagic fever is delayed.There is currently no approved vaccine. Early supportive care with rehydration and symptomatic treatment improves survival.Considering the seasonal increases of cases between December and March, countries in West Africa that have endemic Lassa fever are encouraged to strengthen their related surveillance systems to enhance early detection and treatment of cases, and to reduce the case fatality rate, as well as to strengthen cross border collaboration.",

        "Description of the Situation": "In Nigeria, from 3 to 30 January 2022, 211 laboratory confirmed Lassa fever cases including 40 deaths (case fatality ratio: 19%) have been cumulatively reported in 14 of the 36 Nigerian states and the Federal Capital Territory across the country (Figure 1). Three states account for 82% of confirmed cases: Ondo (63), Edo (57) and Bauchi (53). The other states affected are Benue (11), Ebonyi (5), Oyo (5), Taraba (5), Kogi (4), Enugu (2), Kaduna (2), Cross River (1), Delta (1), Katsina (1) and Plateau (1) (Figure 2).Of the 211 laboratory confirmed cases, five cases have been reported among health workers in two states, Edo (3) and Benue (2).Figure 1.\u00a0Weekly number of reported confirmed Lassa Fever cases and deaths in Nigeria during the epidemiological weeks one (commencing 2 January) through four (commencing 23 January) in 2022.\u00a0In contrast, noticeably less Lassa fever cases with less geographical spread were reported for the same period (epidemiological weeks 1- 4) in 2021 (54 confirmed cases, including 12 deaths, from 8 States). Lassa fever is endemic in Nigeria and the annual peak of Lassa fever cases is typically observed during the dry season (December\u2013April). Thus, the number of infections is expected to rise further until the end of the dry season. While endemic in Nigeria, cases are much higher than the previous epidemic seasons. This could be attributed to reduced response capacity in surveillance and laboratory testing. It is necessary to continue to monitor the annual peaks of Lassa fever in order to contextualize incidence and inform the effective management of Lassa fever.\u00a0Figure 2.\u00a0Confirmed cases of Lassa fever by States reported in Nigeria from 3 \u2013 30 January 2022",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "Coordination: The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has activated the National Emergency Operations Centre alert mode for effective multi-sectoral, multi-disciplinary coordination of the response. Similarly, state public health operation centres were activated in affected states. National rapid response teams (NRRT) have been deployed to the Federal Capital Territory and Bauchi, Benue, Ebonyi, Edo, Nasarawa, Ondo, Oyo and Taraba States. Case Management and Infection Prevention and Control (IPC): Case management, and infection prevention and control (IPC) guidelines have been disseminated. Public and health-care worker advisories have been distributed. Case management and IPC training for treatment centre health-care workers have been conducted.Surveillance: Enhanced surveillance activities for Lassa fever are ongoing in all states including increased case finding. Reported data is used to generate situational updates by the NCDC and inform further response plans.Clinical management: Confirmed cases are being treated at identified treatment centres across the states. Medical response commodities have been distributed to states and treatment centres.Laboratory capacity: The seven national Lassa fever laboratories within the NCDC network that can perform molecular tests are working with full capacity to ensure timely processing of samples.Community engagement: Risk communications and community engagement activities have been scaled up through television, radio, print, social media and other strategies.Vector and environmental control: The Federal Ministry of Environment is implementing a Lassa fever environmental response campaign in affected states.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Lassa fever is a viral haemorrhagic fever that is primarily transmitted to humans via contact with food or household items contaminated with urine or faeces from Mastomys rats. Though to a lesser extent, secondary human-to-human transmission can also occur through direct contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other body fluids of infected persons, especially in health-care settings. As aforementioned, the peak of Lassa fever cases in humans typically occurs in the dry season (December-April) and follows the reproduction cycle of the Mastomys rats in the wet season (May \u2013 November). Given that 90-95% of human infections are due to indirect exposure (through food or household items contaminated by infected rats\u2019 excreta) or direct contact with infected Mastomys rats, the very high density and high circulation of Lassa fever virus in the rat population poses a risk for further human infection during the dry season.Approximately 80% of Lassa virus infections in humans are either asymptomatic or mild, however, infection in the remaining 20% manifests as a febrile illness of variable severity associated with multiple organ dysfunctions with or without haemorrhage. The overall case fatality ratio among all infected people is approximately 1% but is significantly higher among patients hospitalized with severe illness (around 15%).Timely diagnosis results in more rapid isolation of patients and provision of treatment, while also reducing the risk of person-to-person transmission in health care settings. Early supportive care with rehydration and symptomatic treatment improves survival of patients. The current overall risk is considered high at national level. While Lassa fever is endemic in Nigeria and the country has developed an increased capacity for the prevention and control of Lassa fever outbreaks, including strengthened surveillance, diagnostic and treatment capacity, several factors contribute to the current elevated risk level. These include an increase in the number of confirmed cases compared to previous epidemic seasons, gaps in surveillance and varying degrees of subnational response capacity, delays in sample shipment for laboratory testing, a decrease of case management capacity due to conversion of dedicated Lassa fever facilities into COVID-19 health-care facilities and suboptimal IPC procedures. These factors combined warrant the need for further improvement and support of the country\u2019s capacity to detect and respond to Lassa fever outbreaks. In addition, the five confirmed cases among health workers, which included two workers caring for the same patient in the emergency ward, further emphasizes the urgent need to strengthen IPC measures. The overall regional and global risk is considered low due to minimal cross-border transmission from Nigeria to neighbouring countries. Lassa fever is known to be endemic in West African countries, primarily in Sierra Leone, Guinea, Liberia and Nigeria, but may exist in other countries in the same region.",
        "WHO Advice": "Mastomys\u00a0rats are the main reservoir for Lassa virus and so abundant in endemic areas in West Africa that it is not possible to eliminate them from the environment. Prevention of Lassa fever relies on promoting good \u201ccommunity hygiene\u201d to discourage rodents from entering homes. Effective measures include storing grain and other foodstuffs in rodent-proof containers, disposing of waste far from the home, maintaining clean households and considering keeping cats. Precaution should be taken when handling Mastomys rats. \u00a0All animal products should be thoroughly cooked.Those caring for affected persons should be careful and avoid contact with blood and body fluids.In health-care settings, health workers and volunteers should apply standard infection prevention and control (IPC) measures when caring for individuals, regardless of their presumed diagnosis. These include basic hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, use of personal protective equipment (to block splashes or other contact with infected materials) and safe injection practices.Health workers caring for those with suspected or confirmed Lassa fever should apply extra infection control measures to prevent contact with the person\u2019s blood, body fluids and contaminated surfaces or materials such as clothing and bedding. When in close contact (within 1 meter) of individuals with Lassa fever, health workers should wear face protection (a face shield or a medical mask and goggles), a clean, non-sterile long-sleeved gown, and gloves (sterile gloves for some procedures). Personnel working in laboratories are also at risk. Samples taken from suspected Lassa fever cases for diagnostics should be handled by trained staff and processed in suitably equipped laboratories under maximum biological containment conditions.WHO continues to advise all countries endemic for Lassa fever on the need to enhance early detection and treatment of cases to reduce the case fatality rate.WHO advises against any restrictions on travel or trade to or from Nigeria and the affected areas based on the currently available information.",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "Measles is endemic in Afghanistan, with almost all provinces reporting suspected cases every year. Following periods of lower transmission in 2019 and 2020, and amid the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan, weekly notifications of suspected measles cases have been increasing in all provinces since the end of July 2021, with the highest weekly toll observed in the last four weeks in January 2022 (Figure 1). The number of cases and deaths increased by 18% and 40% respectively from week 4, 2022 (week commencing January 24) to week 5, 2022 (week commencing January 31).Figure 1. Weekly number of reported suspected measles cases in Afghanistan. Week 1, 2018 to week 4, 2022. Source: WHO Country Office in Afghanistan, WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean.From 1 January 2021 to 29 January 2022, 35 319 suspected measles cases were reported in Afghanistan, of which 3221 (9%) were laboratory-confirmed by IgM-ELISA in the seven reference laboratories (one national and six regional). Most of the suspected measles cases (91%) occurred among children less than 5 years of age. During the same period, 156 measles deaths were reported among the confirmed cases (CFR=4.8%), with more than 97% of the fatalities registered among children less than 5 years of age. Although the number of deaths is relatively low, the rapid rise in cases suggests that the trend of reported deaths will continue to increase sharply in the coming weeks.The most affected provinces, with the highest number of reported cases (confirmed and suspected) are Balkh, Ghazni, Helmand, Kandahar, Kabul, Paktika, and Paktya. Figure 2 shows the measles notification rate (confirmed and suspected cases) per million population. The highest rates were observed in Paktya (617 cases per 1 000 000), Balkh (275 cases per 1 000 000), Kunduz (204 cases per 1 000 000) Zabul (168 cases per 1 000 000), Kandahar (145 cases per 1 000 000), Logar (127 cases per 1 000 000).Figure 2.

        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "In December 2021, a measles outbreak response immunization campaign reached 1 510 440 children aged 9 to 59 months in Balk, Ghazni, Ghor, Helmand, Kandahar, and Paktika provinces. The campaign was implemented at fixed sites like mosques, schools and other suitable places easily accessible for parents. The highest administrative immunization coverage was reported in Ghor province (121%) and the lowest was reported in Ghazni province (90%). The next nationwide measles immunization campaign will be conducted in the first quarter of 2022. In the provinces where campaigns were conducted, implementing partners are supporting case management, risk communication and community engagement in the affected villages and surrounding areas.Vitamin A supplementation was provided to all children aged 6 to 59 months in November 2021 during the nationwide Polio campaign.WHO is providing technical support on surveillance, vaccination, laboratory testing, case management, and risk communication and together with the Health Cluster, WHO is continuing to coordinate and support a multi-pronged health response.Since November 2021, with emergency funding, WHO is delivering essential life-saving maternal and child health services in 17 provinces through 1209 Sehatmandi health facilities.As part of an emergency response to treat more than 1000 hospitalized children suffering from severe acute malnutrition, WHO supports 123 health clinics specialized in the management of severe acute malnutrition and airlifted 34.6 tons of life-saving health supplies to Afghanistan. The supplies include enough medicines to treat 15 000 people in need of medical care for three months.WHO provided technical and financial support for the establishment of the regional reference laboratory in Paktya province and supported 1131 health facilities to provide essential health services from November 2021 to January 2022, including medical referral facilities.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Measles is a very highly contagious, vaccine-preventable disease caused by a virus that is transmitted by air and through direct contact with infected cases. Unvaccinated young children are at the highest risk of measles and its complications (e.g. pneumonia and encephalitis), including death. Measles outbreaks can result in epidemics with a high case fatality rate, especially among young, malnourished children.Afghanistan is considered a fragile, conflict-affected and vulnerable setting. The country has faced years of compounded crises, under-investment, instability and drought, and has now the highest number of people in emergency food insecurity in the world. According to UNICEF, 14 million people in Afghanistan are facing acute food insecurity, and an estimated 3.2 million children under five years suffer from acute malnutrition.The large and widespread outbreaks and the increasing number of reported measles cases in Afghanistan, is due to a variety of complex factors that on the one hand have resulted in the low immunization coverage of both first dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) and second dose (MCV2), on the other has exacerbated the impact of the outbreak (e.g. high levels of acute malnutrition, winter conditions and crowded domestic situation, previous displacement).\u00a0The 2020 WHO/UNICEF national immunization coverage estimates were 66% for MCV1 and 43% for MCV2. At the sub-national level, administrative coverage data shows that six provinces achieved less than 50% MCV1 coverage (Kandahar 40%; Paktya 38%; Jozjan 37%; Khost 36%; Helmand 18%; Urozgan 3.1%). The internal displacement of 698 000 people in 2021 was another driver of low MCV coverage. Internally displaced persons (IDPs) frequently live in conditions that increase susceptibility to measles (e.g. through less access to immunization services) and may increase measles exposures (e.g. through over-crowding) as well as experiencing poor health outcomes (e.g. due to factors like increasing risk and rates of malnutrition, poor access to curative services). Cross-border travel due to the recent instability in Afghanistan has increased the risk of international spread, particularly in Pakistan and Iran.Overall risk at the national level is assessed as very high due to:Prolonged low measles vaccination coverage that has led to the accumulation of a large susceptible population.High number of internally displaced people.High rates of malnutrition and vitamin A deficiency which could result in increased mortality and expected to increase especially in remote areas during the winter.Inadequate case management due to a shortage of equipment, supplies, and skilled staff in health facilities, long and difficult access to health facilities during the winter period.Barriers to access to healthcare in the rural population.The regional risk is considered moderate due to the movement of people to Tajikistan, Iran and Pakistan, while at the global level the risk is considered low due to moderately high global MCV coverage estimates. More information is required from neighbouring countries and continued monitoring of displacement trends.",
        "WHO Advice": "Two-dose measles vaccination coverage of at least 95% in every province is recommended to ensure immunity. Strengthening routine immunization and conducting outbreak response immunization campaigns are essential for effective control of the epidemic and reducing mortality.The administration of vitamin A, particularly in the context of malnutrition, is critical to reducing morbidity and mortality. Other essential measles prevention and response interventions, include:Ensure a rapid, effective response to current measles outbreaks in Q1 2022. And ensure systems are established and strengthened for routine immunization and the planned SIA later in 2022.Ensure high-quality measles case-based surveillance as a critical strategy for outbreak control.Early detection and confirmation of measles cases to ensure timely and proper case management to reduce morbidity and mortality, enable implementation of appropriate public health strategies to control further transmission.Identify zero-dose populations and areas with low coverage and at higher risk of outbreaks that require enhanced vaccination efforts.Engage with communities to establish two-way dialogue by listening to community concerns and feedback and continually refining the outbreak response according to community needs and perspectives.Identify root causes of measles outbreaks so that immunity gaps and/or system weaknesses can be addressed to reduce the risk of future outbreaks.Strengthen vaccination of health workers to reduce transmission in health care settings and reduce the risk of spread to vulnerable populations.",

        "Public Health Response": "CoordinationAn incident management system has been activated at the national level and in the affected departments to coordinate the response and support the departmental teams.A response plan was developed by the Ministry of Health in coordination with health partners.Readiness and preparedness activities, including the deployment of health personnel, have been strengthened.MonitoringEpidemiological surveillance activities are ongoing, including community-based surveillance, active case finding and case investigations.Analysis of cholera hotspots is ongoing.Laboratory and case managementCollection and analysis of stool samples for confirmation at the National Public Health Laboratory in Cotonou and Parakou is ongoing.Case management has been strengthened through the establishment of treatment facilities and the provision of supplies.Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH)WASH activities are in place, including household disinfection, distribution and demonstration of the proper use of Aquatab water treatment tablets in the community, in addition to well water treatment.Risk CommunicationCommunity awareness of hygiene measures is ongoing, including hand washing, safe food preparation and safe drinking water.Risk communication and community engagement activities are ongoing. This includes mobilizing community leaders, together with relevant stakeholders on cholera prevention measures through using IEC (Information, Education and Communication) material.LogisticsEight cholera kits (including the central reference kit, periphery kit, and community kit) and five laboratory kits have been delivered to support the affected departments. Each kit contains the necessary supplies to help prepare for a potential cholera outbreak and to support the first months of the initial response for 100 cases.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Cholera is an acute enteric infection caused by the ingestion of\u00a0V. cholerae\u00a0bacteria in contaminated water or food. It is mainly linked to insufficient access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation. It is a potentially serious infectious disease that can cause high morbidity and mortality, which can spread rapidly, depending on the frequency of exposure, the exposed population and the setting.Cholera is endemic in Benin and since 2016, cases continue to be reported every year in various departments across the country. The Parakou district in Borgou department is the epicenter of the current outbreak with high commercial traffic to Cotonou, the capital of Benin. The main factors attributed to the initiation and ongoing spread of the cholera epidemics in Benin include:Inadequate hygiene and sanitationThe lack of public hygiene infrastructureLimited supply of safe drinking water\u00a0 Open defecation The poor practice of hand washing.Additionally, Benin shares international borders with Nigeria and Togo, and there is frequent and substantial cross-border population movement. This poses a risk of cross-border transmission of cholera.Given the porous borders with countries responding to cholera outbreaks and inadequate WASH conditions, the national and regional risks of this outbreak is assessed as high while the risk at the global level is considered to be low.",
        "WHO Advice": "WHO recommends improved access to safe drinking water and sanitation, good food safety and hygienic practices to prevent the transmission of cholera.Strengthening surveillance, particularly at the community level, is advised. Appropriate case management, including improved access to care, should be implemented in areas affected by the outbreak to reduce mortality. There is a need to ensure that countries are prepared to rapidly detect and respond to this cholera outbreak to reduce the risk of spread to new areas. As the outbreak is occurring in areas with active cross border population movement, WHO encourages the respective countries to ensure cooperation and regular information sharing.WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel and trade to and from Benin based on the information available on the current outbreak.",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "As of 11 January 2022, 385 suspected cases of Hepatitis E virus (HEV) have been reported, of which, 12 are confirmed and two have associated deaths (case fatality ratio (CFR): 0.5%) have been reported in six villages in Lai district, Tandjile region, Chad. Health authorities began an investigation on 1 October 2021 for a cluster of 25 suspected HEV cases presenting with jaundice, fever, and epigastric pain. Sixty-five percent (13/20) of samples tested at the Ndjamena General Hospital were positive for HEV using rapid diagnostic tests. The same batch of 20 samples was referred to the Centre Pasteur in Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon, a WHO collaborating centre for confirmation and 12 tested positive for HEV by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The results for blood samples from a further 29 of the suspected cases remain pending.Of the 385 reported cases, more than half were male (n=215; 57%). Cases aged less than 10 years (n=90; 23.4%) and 21-30 years (n=89; 23.1%) accounted for the largest proportion of cases. Heavy rain in Chad since June 2021 have greatly impacted the Tandjile region and by October 2021, approximately 161 000 people were affected. Floodwaters caused substantial infrastructural damage in a setting that has pre-existing water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) challenges such as a poor access to safe drinking water and high rates of open defecation. The last known outbreak of HEV in Chad began in August 2016 and lasted for 17 months before the Ministry of Health declared the end of the outbreak in February 2018. A total of 1874 suspected HEV cases and 23 associated deaths were reported. The area affected in this outbreak was located in the Salamat region, just over 700 km northeast of the current outbreak.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "Coordination meetings have been organised for the district management team, Ministry of Health team, and partners.Case management is being coordinated at a provincial and district-level.Field investigations have been conducted in the affected areas and samples (both human and environmental) were collected and analysed.Active surveillance is ongoing within the communities.Water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) activities are ongoing including enumeration of boreholes in all affected villages and provision of water and sanitation to the affected areas.Community risk communication activities are ongoing.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Suspected HEV cases have been detected in Chad after nearly four years without any reported cases. Heavy rains causing flooding have created favourable conditions for HEV transmission, including a large amount of displaced people living in precarious situations where clean drinking water, sanitation, hygiene, and health services are limited. The main risks of spread at the national level are 1) poor sanitation and hygiene practices especially in areas affected by floods; 2) high rates of open defecation; 3) lack of access to safe drinking water; and 4) presence of large internally displaced population. At a regional level the risk of HEV transmission is currently low. However, the risk may be affected by the increased number of displaced persons in Tandjile region and from other southern regions of the country, some of which share a border with Cameroon and the Central African Republic. HEV outbreaks are currently occurring in South Sudan and Sudan, however no epidemiological links have been established with the outbreak in Chad. During the last documented outbreak in Chad which ended in 2018, genomic sequencing of isolates from HEV cases reported in South Sudan showed HEV genotype 1 sub-genotype 1e, that was closely related to strains isolated in Chad and Uganda.",
        "WHO Advice": "Hepatitis E is a liver disease caused by the HEV. Hepatitis E is found worldwide and is common in countries with limited access to essential water, sanitation, hygiene, and health services, or in areas with humanitarian emergencies.HEV is transmitted mainly by the faecal-oral route, primarily through contaminated water. The infection is usually self-limiting and resolves within 2\u20136 weeks. Occasionally a serious disease known as fulminant hepatitis (acute liver failure) develops, which can be fatal. Fulminant hepatitis is more common when hepatitis E occurs during pregnancy, especially in the second and third trimester, putting pregnant women at increased risk of acute liver failure, foetal loss, and mortality. The case-fatality ratio can be as high as 20-25% in the last trimester of pregnancy.There is no specific treatment capable of altering the course of acute hepatitis E other than general management of acute liver failure as needed, and supportive care. As the disease is usually self-limiting, hospitalization is generally not required. Prevention is crucial against this disease. At the population level, the most important interventions to reduce the transmission of HEV are provision of safe drinking water, and provision of adequate water and sanitation hygiene. At the individual level, risk of infection can be reduced by maintaining hygienic practices such as washing hands with clean water and soap - especially before handling food, avoiding consumption of water and/or ice of unknown purity, and following other WHO hygiene practices for food safety. Coverage of latrines and drinking water sources, along with community engagement should be increased in conjunction with other sanitation interventions in an aim to prevent open defecation and to ensure hand hygiene. Health promotion and prevention activities, as well as ensuring early, appropriate, and equitable health care services to combat HEV epidemics, can help improve public health outcomes, especially in resource-limited settings. As the incubation period for HEV ranges from 2-10 weeks, cases may continue to occur up to the tenth week (maximum incubation period) even after measures to ensure safe WASH promotion have been adopted.It remains important that interventions continue to target vulnerable populations by establishing or strengthening antenatal diagnosis for pregnant women with symptoms, strengthening national capacities for diagnosis and clinical case management, and cross-border collaboration with neighboring countries.A hepatitis E vaccine has been developed for commercialization and licensed in China and Pakistan. While WHO does not recommend the introduction of the vaccine as part of national routine immunization programs, WHO recommends that national authorities may decide to use the vaccine in outbreak settings, including in populations at high risks, such as pregnant women. Vaccine use should therefore be considered to mitigate or prevent an outbreak of hepatitis E, as well as to reduce the effects of an outbreak in high-risk individuals.WHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions on Chad or any of the affected countries based on the currently available information.",

        "Date Reported": "14 January 2022",
        "Location": "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "On 6 January 2022, the International Health Regulations (IHR) Focal Point of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland notified WHO of the detection of a laboratory confirmed human case of avian influenza A(H5) from South West England.The case lived with a large number of domestically kept birds which had onset of illness on 18 December 2021, and subsequently tested positive with Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) by the United Kingdom National Reference Laboratory at the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) Weybridge laboratory.\u00a0 As part of routine follow up of exposed persons to avian influenza cases, an upper respiratory swab was taken from the case on 24 December 2021 which tested positive for influenza A with subtyping H5. Further characterization of the virus is ongoing. This result was reproduced on two successive upper respiratory swabs collected during the following days. The case has remained clinically asymptomatic and is now considered to not be infectious.Following successful virus isolation from samples collected from birds on the infected premises, APHA analyzed full genome sequence data for the HPAI A(H5N1) virus present in these birds. Genomic analysis demonstrated that the sequence generated contained no strong correlates for specific increased affinity for humans.",
        "Epidemiology": "",
        "Public Health Response": "All contacts have been identified and managed according to the national public health protocols. None of the contacts have reported symptoms and no evidence of secondary transmission has been identified to date. The infected premises were visited by APHA personnel who completed culling of all the birds. Several measures including complete decontamination and cleaning of the outside of the property have been completed.A three-kilometer captive bird (monitoring) controlled zone was declared by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs around the infected premises. The zone will remain in place for at least 21 days following the completion of preliminary cleansing and disinfection and will not be lifted until surveillance activities including clinical inspections of all commercial premises in the\u00a0zone have been undertaken.",
        "WHO Risk Assessment": "Since 2003, a total of 863 cases and 455 deaths of influenza A(H5N1) human infection have been reported worldwide, including this case in the United Kingdom. The most recently reported case in humans prior to the current case, was in October 2020 in Lao People's Democratic Republic in a one-year-old female who had exposure to backyard poultry (for more details, please see the Disease Outbreak News published on 17 November 2020).\u00a0\u00a0Since 1 October 2021, there have been 73 poultry cases and 471 detections in individual wild birds of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N1)This is the first reported case of human infection of influenza A(H5) infection in the United Kingdom. The case remained clinically asymptomatic. The virus has not been detected beyond this single case. Public health measures from both the human and animal health agencies have been implemented. Based on available information, WHO assesses the risk to the general population posed by this virus to be low and for occupationally exposed persons it is considered to be low-to-moderate. \u00a0There are no specific vaccines for preventing Influenza A(H5N1) in humans. Candidate vaccines to prevent H5 infection in humans have been developed for pandemic preparedness purposes. Close analysis of the epidemiological situation, further characterization of the most recent viruses (human and poultry) and serological investigations are critical to assess associated risk and to adjust risk management measures in a timely manner.",
        "WHO Advice": "This case does not change the current WHO recommendations on public health measures and surveillance of influenza.Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect and monitor virological, epidemiological and clinical changes associated with emerging or circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health with timely sharing of such viruses and related information for risk assessment.All human infections caused by a novel influenza subtype are notifiable under the\u00a0International Health Regulations (IHR)\u00a0and State Parties to the IHR (2005) are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic.\u00a0Evidence of illness is not required for this report (for more details, please see Case definitions for the four diseases requiring notification in all circumstances under the International Health Regulations (2005)).In the case of a confirmed or suspected human infection caused by a novel influenza virus with pandemic potential, including a variant virus, a thorough epidemiological investigation (even while awaiting the confirmatory laboratory results) of history of exposure to animals, of travel, and contact tracing should be conducted. The epidemiological investigation should include early identification of unusual respiratory events that could signal person-to-person transmission of the novel virus and clinical samples collected from the time and place that the case occurred should be tested and sent to a WHO Collaboration Center for further characterization.When avian influenza viruses are circulating in an area, people involved in specific high-risk activities such as sampling sick birds, culling and disposing of infected birds, eggs, litters and cleaning of contaminated premises should be trained on the proper use of and provided with appropriate personal protective equipment. All persons involved in these activities should be registered and monitored closely by local health authorities for seven days following the last day of contact with poultry or their environments.Travelers to countries with known outbreaks of animal influenza should avoid farms, contact with animals in live animal markets, entering areas where animals may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with animal feces. Travelers should wash their hands often with soap and water. Travelers should also follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices. Should infected individuals from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during travel or after arrival. If this were to occur, further community level spread is considered unlikely as this virus has not acquired the ability to transmit easily among humans.WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel and/or trade with the United Kingdom based on the currently available information.",
