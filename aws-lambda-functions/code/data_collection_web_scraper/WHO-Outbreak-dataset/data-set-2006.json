        "Description of the Situation": "27 December 2006 \n\nThe Egyptian Ministry of Health and Population has informed WHO of three new human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection. All three cases belong to one extended family in Gharbiyah province, 80 kilometres northwest of the capital city, Cairo. While being transferred and cared for at the country's designated avian influenza hospital, a 30 year-old female, a 15 year-old girl and a 26 year-old male died. The most recent death occurred on 27 December. The cases reportedly had contact with sick poultry (ducks).\n\nClinical specimens from the three cases were tested positive for avian influenza A(H5N1) virus by Egyptian Central Public Health Laboratory. The virus was also detected in specimens from two of the three patients by US Naval Medical Research Unit No.3 (NAMRU-3). The samples will be sent to WHO Collaborating Centre for further testing including virus characterization.\n\nThe Egyptian Ministry of Health and Population is conducting further investigations and has initiated public health measures. The other family members remain healthy and have been placed under close observation.",

The affected states are Andhra Pradesh, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Kerala and Delhi. More than 1.25 million suspected cases have been reported from the country, which 752,245 were from Karnataka and 258,998 from Maharashtra provinces. In some areas reported attack rates have reached 45%.\n\nA team from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, health officials from Kerala and staff from the WHO India Office and Regional Office for South-East Asia investigated the outbreak in Kerala. They carried out clinical and epidemiological examinations of suspected cases in hospitals and at home, and collected clinical samples. An entomological survey revealed high densities of Aedes albopictus in the affected areas as well as in areas not affected by the disease.\n\nFor personal protection, individuals should take measures to protect themselves against the bites of the mosquitoes which transmit the virus (including Aedes aegypti), which are active during the daytime. Elimination of breeding sites can contribute to the reduction of mosquito densities. As a result, a key recommendation from the investigation team is for urgent vector control measures coupled with an intensive awareness campaign in the community. Health care staff at all levels, government officials and nongovernmental organizations are called upon to assist in this information and health education campaign.

        "Description of the Situation": "14 September 2006 \n\nThe Ministry of Health in Indonesia has confirmed two additional cases of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus. These cases occurred in March and May 2006.\n\nThe first case occurred in a five-year-old male from East Bekasi, West Java Province. He developed symptoms on 4 March 2006, was admitted to hospital on 6 March, and died on 19 March. Test results, using two different assays, showed high antibody titer for H5N1 on consecutive serum samples taken on days 11 and 15 of his illness. These test results are consistent with new WHO criteria for laboratory confirmation. A field investigation at the time found that the case was exposed to diseased poultry in the vicinity of his home, where some birds tested positive for the H5 virus subtype.\n\nThe second case is a 27-year-old male from Solok, West Sumatra Province. This case was identified during the tracing of contacts of the man\u2019s sister, a 15-year-old female who developed symptoms on 17 May 2006 and was subsequently confirmed to be H5N1 infected. Her brother spent six days caring for her during her hospital stay. The brother developed mild symptoms of cough and abdominal discomfort, with no fever, on 28 May 2006; his symptoms remained mild and he recovered within a few days.\n\nDespite his mild and atypical symptoms, the brother was tested as part of the Ministry of Health\u2019s protocol for contact tracing and the management of any contacts with symptoms. He was given a five-day course of oseltamivir beginning on 1 June and was placed in voluntary isolation pending recovery.\n\nInitial tests of samples collected from the 27-year-old male were negative for H5N1 infection. In August, follow-up testing of paired-serum samples found a fourfold rise in neutralization antibody titer for H5N1, a test result which meets the WHO criteria for laboratory confirmation.\n\nThe 27-year-old male reported no contact with diseased or dead poultry in the days prior to symptom onset as he spent most of his time at the hospital. The investigation determined that he had exposure to his sister during her hospital stay, and that human-to-human transmission could not be ruled out as the source of his infection.\n\nThe retrospectively confirmed cases bring the total in Indonesia to 65. Of these cases, 49 have been fatal.",

        "Description of the Situation": "21 August 2006 \n\nThe Ministry of Health in Indonesia has confirmed the country\u2019s 59th case of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus.\n\nThe case occurred in a 35-year-old woman from the remote subdistrict of Cikelet, West Java Province. She developed symptoms on 8 August, was hospitalized with severe respiratory disease on 17 August and died shortly after admission.\n\nShe is the third confirmed case from this sub-district to be reported in the past week.\n\nPreliminary findings from the Cikelet investigation\n\nA team of experts is presently in the Cikelet subdistrict investigating the outbreak and monitoring for further cases. Three hamlets are the focus of investigation.\n\nThe Cikelet subdistrict consists of around 20 isolated hamlets, each with a population of around 200 to 400 persons, many living in large extended families. The hamlets sit in a basin surrounded by steep mountains with rocky winding paths best accessed by foot or horseback.\n\nIn this area, mortality from endemic diseases, especially malaria, is common, access to health care is poor, and medical records of deaths are scanty or non-existent.\n\nPrior to late June 2006, no mass die-offs of poultry are known to have occurred in the area. At that time, live chickens were purchased from an outside market in preparation for a religious feast and were integrated into local flocks. Shortly thereafter, chickens began dying in large numbers in an outbreak that continued throughout July and the first week of August, gradually spreading from one hamlet to another.\n\nAs the population had no experience with this disease, high-risk behaviours commonly occurred during the disposal of carcasses or the preparation of sick or dead birds for consumption. These exposures are, at present, thought to be the source of infection for most confirmed or suspected cases.\n\nDeaths from respiratory illness are known to have occurred in late July and early August, but no samples were taken and medical records are generally poor. Though some of these undiagnosed deaths occurred in family members of confirmed cases, the investigation has found no evidence of human-to-human transmission and no evidence that the virus is spreading more easily from birds to humans.\n\nThe cooperation of residents is good, house-to-house surveillance for febrile illness is continuing, and specimens have been taken from symptomatic persons and sent for testing. The team is well-supplied with antiviral drugs, and these are being administered prophylactically to close contacts of cases and therapeutically to persons showing symptoms of influenza-like illness.",

She developed symptoms on 1 August, was hospitalized on 14 August, and died on 15 August. Recent chicken deaths were reported in her household.\n\nThree hamlets within the village are currently under investigation. An additional case from the village, but from another hamlet, was confirmed by the Ministry of Health on 14 August. This 17-year-old male developed symptoms on 26 July and is now recovering. Another death from severe respiratory disease occurred on 5 August in a 20-year-old neighbour, who is also now known to be a cousin. As no samples were taken for testing, the cause of his illness remains uncertain. Based on epidemiological and clinical findings, however, infection with the H5N1 virus is strongly suspected.\n\nAs both young men developed symptoms on the same day (26 July), epidemiologists assume that they acquired their infection from a shared environmental source. The currently recognized incubation period for H5N1 infection of 2 to 8 days makes human-human transmission between the two highly improbable.\n\nTeams from local health authorities, the Ministry of Health, and WHO are currently in the three hamlets investigating these cases and assessing the overall situation. Team members include experts in animal health. Recent die-offs of poultry are known to have occurred in the village, and all three cases described above had documented exposure to diseased chickens.\n\nHeightened awareness in the hamlets, supported by the presence of well-equipped teams, has led to the presentation of additional persons for medical evaluation. Specimens have been taken and tests are being conducted. Rumours of additional deaths from respiratory disease in the hamlets in late July and early August are also being investigated.\n\nAlthough the village is remote and access by road is difficult, good communications from the field have been established with the Ministry of Health and WHO.\n\nOf the 58 cases confirmed to date in Indonesia, 45 have been fatal.",

        "Description of the Situation": "8 August 2006 \n\nThe Ministry of Health in China has today retrospectively confirmed a human case of H5N1 infection dating back to November 2003. The case occurred in a 24-year-old member of the military service based in Beijing. The man developed symptoms on 25 November 2003 and was hospitalized with pneumonia in Beijing. His condition deteriorated rapidly and he died of severe respiratory disease on 3 December 2003.\n\nConfirmation of this case marks the earliest known instance of human H5N1 infection in mainland China, and is now the first confirmed case in the present outbreak. Previously, the first confirmed cases were thought to have occurred in Viet Nam in December 2003.\n\nThe case was initially reported by several Chinese researchers, affiliated with the military services, in a June 2006 letter to the New England Journal of Medicine. According to that communication, doctors initially suspected the man might have been infected with the SARS virus. Although WHO declared the SARS outbreak over in July 2003, suspicions were high that the virus might return during the cooler months.\n\nSpecimens tested for SARS infection prior to the man\u2019s death were negative, but the cause of death remained undetermined. As stated in the published letter, stored specimens from the man subsequently tested positive for H5N1 infection. Successful isolation of the virus from these specimens was also reported.\n\nAs the man\u2019s illness was initially thought to be SARS, no history of possible poultry exposure was taken. The source of his H5N1 infection remains uncertain, particularly as no poultry outbreaks of H5N1 avian influenza have been reported in Beijing.\n\nThe Ministry of Health informed WHO that it had been unaware of these tests and their results prior to publication of the research letter. In line with WHO recommendations, confirmatory testing in a laboratory affiliated with the Ministry of Health was arranged. Following an official request, WHO sent laboratory experts to consult with national experts performing the tests. That joint undertaking, conducted in late July, confirmed the man\u2019s infection with the H5N1 virus. These findings were further reviewed by a panel of experts, which concluded that the man\u2019s H5N1 infection was now laboratory confirmed.\n\nPrior to this announcement, the first official laboratory-confirmed H5N1 case on the Chinese mainland occurred in Hunan Province in October 2005 and was reported to WHO in mid-November 2005.\n\nThe case has been added to the WHO cumulative table of confirmed cases. Retrospective confirmation of the case brings the cumulative total in China to 20. Of these cases, 13 have been fatal.\n\nThe Ministry of Health has informed WHO of its intention to strengthen communication mechanisms, and to ensure that more of the country\u2019s research institutes are integrated into the reporting system. WHO will be providing support and guidance in these activities, as officially requested.",

        "Description of the Situation": "7 June 2006\n\nThirty-four suspect cases with sudden paralysis are under investigation, mostly in the Windhoek area of Namibia, of which three have been confirmed as wild poliovirus. What is thought to be the first case is a 39-year old man with onset of paralysis on 8 May, later confirmed as infected with wild poliovirus type-1. The majority of suspect cases are over 20 years old; seven of the individuals have died.\n\nNational health authorities are planning a response to an outbreak of wild poliovirus in Namibia, polio-free since 1996. An investigation of the outbreak \u2013 which unusually appears to be affecting mostly adults \u2013 is currently under way. Genetic sequencing confirms that the virus is consistent with an importation from Angola, of Indian origin. Angola, polio-free since 2001, was re-infected last year by a virus from India.\n\nThe Government is planning an immunization response consisting of three National Immunization Days (NIDs), using monovalent oral polio vaccine type 1 (mOPV1). The first NID could be conducted as early as 21 June, and will aim to reach the entire population of the country (two million), rather than the usual under-five year population. The age of any further cases will dictate the target age groups for the two subsequent NIDs. An international team is in the country to assist the national authorities.\n\nNamibia began routine immunization for polio in 1990. While the cause of the largely adult outbreak is yet to be determined, it is likely that those who fell ill did not receive immunization as children. Routine immunization coverage within Namibia today varies by region from 60% to 80%.\nFor more information\n\n\nGlobal Polio Eradication Initiative",

        "Description of the Situation": "31 May 2006 \n\nSituation update \n\nIndonesian health authorities and WHO have further strengthened their response to the family cluster of cases in Kubu Simbelang village, Karo District, North Sumatra. As of today, 54 surviving family members and other close contacts of cases have been identified and placed under voluntary home quarantine. All of these people, with the exception of pregnant women and infants, are receiving the antiviral drug, oseltamivir, for prophylactic purposes. Public health teams visit these people daily, checking for symptoms.\n\nIn addition, active house-to-house surveillance for influenza-like illness is being conducted throughout the village, which has around 400 households. A command post for fever surveillance has been functioning in the village since last week.\n\nAs of today, no new cases suggestive of H5N1 infection have been detected since 22 May. This finding is important as it indicates that the virus has not spread beyond the members of this single extended family. No hospital staff involved in the care of patients, in some instances without adequate personal protective equipment, have developed the disease. The last person in the cluster, who developed symptoms on 15 May and died on 22 May, refused hospitalization. He moved between two villages while ill, accompanied by his wife. The wife is under surveillance and has not developed symptoms.\n\nDespite multiple opportunities for the virus to spread to other family members, health care workers or into the general community, it has not, on present evidence, done so.\n\nCurrent level of pandemic alert \n\nBased on an assessment of present evidence, WHO has concluded that the current level of pandemic alert is appropriate and does not need to change. The level of pandemic alert remains at phase 3. This phase pertains to a situation in which occasional human infections with a novel influenza virus are occurring, but there is no evidence that the virus is spreading in an efficient and sustained manner from one person to another.\n\nWHO has recommended continued close monitoring of the situation in Kubu Simbelang for the two weeks following 22 May, the date when the last known case in the cluster died. As a precautionary measure, Indonesian authorities have decided to extend this recommended period to three weeks.\n\nPreliminary results of the investigation \n\nThis information differs in some details from information released in previous updates, but is derived from extensive investigations by senior national and international epidemiologists, from WHO and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who have developed a clearer picture of the situation.\n\nThe cluster involves an initial case and seven subsequent laboratory-confirmed cases. All cases are members of an extended family: sisters and brothers and their children. Family members resided in four households. Three households were next-door neighbours in the village of Kubu Simbelang, Karo District, North Sumatra. The fourth household was located about 10 kilometres away in the nearby village of Kabanjahe.\n\nThe initial case in the cluster was a 37-year-old woman who sold fruits and chillies at a market in the village of Tigapanah. Her stand was located about 15 metres away from a stand where live chickens were sold. The investigation uncovered no reports of poultry die-offs in the market. However, the woman kept a small number of backyard chickens, allowed into the house at night. Three of her chickens reportedly died before she became ill. She is also known to have used chicken faeces from these household chickens as fertilizer in her garden.\n\nA parallel agricultural investigation has not, to date, detected H5N1 virus in PCR tests of approximately 80 samples from poultry, other livestock and domestic pets, and chicken fertilizer taken from the vicinity.\n\nThe initial case developed symptoms on 24 April, was hospitalized on 2 May, and died on 4 May. No samples were collected for testing prior to her burial, but she is considered part of the cluster as her clinical course was compatible with H5N1 infection.\n\nThe initial case had one sister and three brothers. The sister and two of the brothers subsequently developed infection. The remaining cases occurred among children in these families.\n\nThe confirmed cases include five males and two females with an average age of 19 years (range from 1 to 32 years). Six out of the seven confirmed cases developed symptoms between 3 May and 5 May. These cases include two sons of the initial case, her brother from Kabanjahe, her sister, the sister\u2019s baby, and the son of a second brother living in an adjacent house. This second brother, the last case in the cluster, developed symptoms on 15 May. Six out of the seven cases were fatal.\n\nExposures \n\nOn the night of 29 April, nine family members spent the night in a small room with the initial case at a time when she was severely ill, prostrate, and coughing heavily. These family members included the initial case and her three sons; the brother from Kabanjahe village, his wife, and their two children; the 21-year-old daughter of another brother (who did not become infected); and another young male visitor. Following this event, three family members \u2013 the woman\u2019s two sons and the visiting brother from Kabanjahe \u2013 developed symptoms from 5 to 6 days later.\n\nThe woman\u2019s sister, who lived in an adjacent house, developed symptoms at the same time, as did her 18-month-old daughter. Prior to symptom onset, this sister, accompanied by her daughter, provided close personal care of the initial case.\n\nThe last case in the cluster provided close care for his son throughout his hospital stay, from 9\u201313 May. The son was a frequent visitor in the home of the initial case and was present there on 29 April.",

        "Description of the Situation": "29 May 2006 \n\nThe Ministry of Health in Indonesia has confirmed an additional six cases of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus. Three of these cases were fatal.\n\nNone of the newly confirmed cases is associated with the family cluster in Karo, North Sumatra. The cases are widely dispersed geographically (see map below).\n\nOne newly confirmed case is an 18-year-old man from East Java Province. He developed symptoms on 6 May and was hospitalized on 17 May. He is now recovering. The investigation found a history of exposure to dead chickens in his home within the week prior to symptom onset. No further cases of influenza-like illness have been identified during the investigation and monitoring of his close contacts.\n\nTwo additional cases occurred in a 10-year-old girl and her 18-year-old brother from Bandung, West Java. Both children developed symptoms on 16 May, were hospitalized on 22 May, and died on 23 May. Both children had a history of close contact with sick and dying chickens at their home in the week before symptom onset. The identical onset dates strongly suggest that they acquired their infection following a shared exposure to poultry, and not from each other. Follow-up of contacts has not identified further cases of influenza-like illness.\n\nAn additional case occurred in a 39-year-old man from West Jakarta. He developed symptoms on 9 May, was hospitalized on 16 May, and died on 19 May. The investigation determined that the man cleaned pigeon faeces from blocked roof gutters at his home shortly before symptom onset. No further potential source of exposure was identified.\n\nThe remaining two patients are a 43-year-old man from South Jakarta, who developed symptoms on 6 May, and a 15-year-old girl from West Sumatra, who developed symptoms on 17 May. The 43-year-old man has recovered and been discharged from hospital. The 15-year-old girl remains hospitalized. The sources of exposure for these two cases are under investigation.\n\nThe newly confirmed cases bring the cumulative total in Indonesia to 48. Of these cases, 36 were fatal.\n\nMaps showing the location of Indonesia\u2019s H5N1 cases can be found on the  WHO Indonesia avian influenza web site .\n\n      (Click image to enlarge, 100k)",

The case occurred in a 32-year-old man. He developed symptoms on 15 May and died on 22 May.\n\nThe case is part of a family cluster in the Kubu Sembelang village, Karo District, of North Sumatra. The man is the seventh member of an extended family to become infected with the H5N1 virus and the sixth to die. An additional person, who was the first member of the family to fall ill, died of respiratory disease on 4 May. No specimens were taken prior to her burial and the cause of her death cannot be determined. However, as her clinical course was compatible with H5N1 infection, epidemiologists at the outbreak site include this woman as the initial case in the cluster. \n\nThe newly confirmed case is a brother of the initial case. Specimens were taken on 21 May and flown the same day to Jakarta. Tests run overnight confirmed his infection. His 10-year-old son died of H5N1 infection on 13 May. The father was closely involved in caring for his son, and this contact is considered a possible source of infection.\n\nAlthough the investigation is continuing, preliminary findings indicate that three of the confirmed cases spent the night of 29 April in a small room together with the initial case at a time when she was symptomatic and coughing frequently. These cases include the woman\u2019s two sons and a second brother, aged 25 years, who is the sole surviving case among infected members of this family. Other infected family members lived in adjacent homes.\n\nAll confirmed cases in the cluster can be directly linked to close and prolonged exposure to a patient during a phase of severe illness. Although human-to-human transmission cannot be ruled out, the search for a possible alternative source of exposure is continuing.\n\nBoth the Ministry of Health and WHO are concerned about the situation in Kubu Sembelang and have intensified investigation and response activities. Priority is now being given to the search for additional cases of influenza-like illness in other family members, close contacts, and the general community. To date, the investigation has found no evidence of spread within the general community and no evidence that efficient human-to-human transmission has occurred.\n\nAnalysis of viruses \n\nFull genetic sequencing of two viruses isolated from cases in this cluster has been completed by WHO H5 reference laboratories in Hong Kong and the USA. Sequencing of all eight gene segments found no evidence of genetic reassortment with human or pig influenza viruses and no evidence of significant mutations. The viruses showed no mutations associated with resistance to the neuraminidase inhibitors, including oseltamivir (Tamiflu).\n\nThe human viruses from this cluster are genetically similar to viruses isolated from poultry in North Sumatra during a previous outbreak.",

Epidemiologists at the outbreak site believe this exposure may represent second-generation cases arising from limited human-to-human transmission. Other infected family members lived in adjacent homes.\n\nBased on exposure histories and what is known about the incubation period of this disease, the most recently confirmed case is being investigated as possibly representing a third-generation case arising from limited human-to-human transmission.\n\nFamily members and village residents have not reported any recent large die-off of poultry or other livestock. No virus has been detected in samples taken from poultry, other animals, fertilizer, and other environmental sources in the village and neighbouring areas.\n\nBoth the Ministry of Health and WHO are concerned about the situation in Kubu Sembelang and are rapidly intensifying investigation and response activities. At present, all known cases can be directly linked to close and prolonged exposure to a patient during a phase of severe illness. No evidence points to spread within the general community or suggests that efficient human-to-human transmission has occurred.\n\nPriority is now being given to the search for additional cases of influenza-like illness in other family members, close contacts, and the general community. The Ministry of Health has immediately strengthened its support to district health officials in the area. In collaboration with WHO, two operational hubs are being established to strengthen capacities in the areas of transportation, logistics, and communications and to support the deployment of more staff, should this be needed.\n\nIndonesia has great experience in the field investigation of human cases, a close working relationship with WHO in Jakarta, and a good record of prompt and transparent reporting. Since the first case was reported in July of last year, each human case has prompted an immediate and thorough field investigation, usually conducted by staff from both the agricultural and health sectors and often with WHO support. This activity is now being intensified.\n\nThe challenges in North Sumatra are, however, great. The village is in an isolated mountainous area. Residents have been traumatized by the sudden deaths and mystified by the appearance of this disease despite the apparent health of poultry and other livestock. Bereaved family members have shown some reluctance to collaborate with authorities and many questions remain unanswered. Distrust of the authorities, investigators, and the diagnosis is widespread. Given the high mortality, hospitalization is associated with a fatal outcome. The most recently confirmed case refused hospital admission throughout most of his illness. He died this morning en route to a hospital.",

She developed symptoms on 27 April and died of respiratory disease on 4 May. No specimens were obtained before her burial, and the cause of her death cannot be confirmed. She is, however, considered the initial case in this family cluster.\n\nThe six confirmed cases in Sumatra include the woman\u2019s two sons, aged 15 and 17 years, who died respectively on 9 May and 12 May. The 28-year-old sister of the initial case died on 10 May. This sister had an 18-month-old girl, who died on 14 May. The fifth confirmed case, who is still alive, is the 25-year-old brother of the initial case. The sixth confirmed case is the 10-year-old nephew of the initial case. He died on 13 May.\n\nOne additional family member, who had been hospitalized, has subsequently been ruled out based on both negative laboratory results and the absence of clinical symptoms compatible with H5N1 infection.\n\nThis is the largest cluster of cases, closely related in time and place, reported to date in any country and is being carefully investigated by Indonesia\u2019s ministries of health and agriculture and by WHO epidemiologists. The source of exposure for the initial case is still under investigation, with exposure to infected poultry or an environment contaminated by their faeces considered the most plausible source.\n\nThe likely source of infection for the additional cases has not yet been determined. Multiple hypotheses are being investigated. Apart from living in close proximity to each other, the cases in this cluster are known to have participated in a family gathering around 29 April.

She is presently in a stable condition with persistent symptoms.\n\nThree tests conducted on 10 May by the Cairo-based US Naval Medical Research Unit 3 (NAMRU-3) confirmed the child\u2019s infection with the H5N1 virus. She is the first case of human infection reported in the Horn of Africa.\n\nThree of the child\u2019s siblings are under investigation for possible infection and are also receiving care. Samples have been taken and are being sent to NAMRU-3 for testing.\n\nHealth authorities in Djibouti initiated surveillance for human cases following reports of a small number of chicken deaths in early April. NAMRU-3 has also confirmed the presence of H5N1 virus in samples from three chickens.\n\nSurveillance for additional human and animal cases is presently under way, but is hindered by the country\u2019s lack of resources and of epidemiological and laboratory capacities. The search for human cases has been further complicated by a concurrent outbreak of dengue fever, which can mask the occurrence of other febrile illnesses with abrupt onset of symptoms, including H5N1 infection.\n\nThe situation in animals is poorly understood. Most of the country\u2019s population is concentrated in the Djibouti district, where many households keep small numbers of poultry. Poultry production in other parts of the country is limited. High mortality in poultry flocks has not been detected to date.\n\nAt the request of the Ministry of Health, WHO is arranging urgent support for the country\u2019s investigation and response to the outbreak.",

She developed symptoms on 12 March following the home slaughter of chickens. She was hospitalized on 16 March and died on 27 March.\n\nThe country\u2019s first case, previously reported, occurred in a 30-year-old woman, also from Qaliubiya, who died on 17 March.\n\nTests conducted by the Cairo-based US Naval Medical Research Unit 3 (NAMRU-3) have confirmed an additional three cases.\n\nA 32-year-old man, who worked on a farm where poultry were recently culled, developed symptoms on 16 March and was hospitalized the same day. He has since recovered.\n\nA 17-year-old boy, whose father runs a poultry farm in the Gharbiya governorate in the Nile Delta, developed symptoms on 18 March and was hospitalized the following day. He has since recovered.\n\nThe fifth case is an 18-year-old girl from the Kafr El-Sheikh governorate. She developed symptoms following the slaughter of sick backyard poultry. She was hospitalized on 25 March.\n\nAt present, the Ministry of Health has confirmed all five cases based on results from the NAMRU-3 laboratory. Samples from these cases have been sent to a WHO collaborating laboratory in the United Kingdom for diagnostic verification. WHO will adjust the figures in its cumulative number of cases following the results of this external verification. Test results are expected later this week.\n\nHealth authorities have screened more than 350 people who were contacts of these patients or had a recent history of exposure to diseased birds. All test results have been negative for H5N1 infection.\n\nEgypt has a large population of poultry, many of which are kept on roof terraces in close proximity to humans. H5N1 outbreaks in poultry have now been reported in 19 of the country\u2019s 26 governorates. Since the first outbreak was confirmed on 17 February, more than 25 million birds have died or been destroyed.",

        "Description of the Situation": "22 March 2006\n\nOn 17 March, WHO received reports of a possible outbreak of botulism in northern Thailand (Nan Province) among guests at a festival who had eaten home-preserved bamboo shoots. Although antitoxin for the treatment of botulism is only available in some countries, WHO was able to ensure delivery of antitoxin to Thailand by the morning of 19 March.\n\nAs of 20 March, the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) established that 152 of the 170 people attending a local village Buddhist festival in Banluang District, Nan Province, had developed symptoms suggestive of botulism (dysphagia, dysarthria, ptosis, abdominal discomfort, muscle weakness). All of the affected people had eaten pickled bamboo shoots prepared in a traditional manner, with symptoms developing and progressing over 24-48 hours following consumption. One hundred of the 152 people were hospitalized, and 40 have since required intubation and respirator support. To date, no deaths have been reported.\n\nThe local health office has traced and recalled the suspect cans of locally produced bamboo shoots and is providing public education on food safety. WHO is working closely with the MOPH, local technical partners and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on laboratory investigation in support of case diagnosis, investigation, and foodborne disease investigation and surveillance. A case control and cohort study is under way to describe the outbreak in detail.\n\nTo date, 80 doses of antitoxin (20 from the United Kingdom, 50 from CDC Atlanta and 10 from Sanofi-Pasteur Canada) have been provided, and severely affected patients are being treated. The Japanese National Institute of Infectious Disease is planning to deliver another 23 doses of antitoxin to Thailand today.",

        "Description of the Situation": "21 March 2006\n\nSamples from 11 patients under investigation in Azerbaijan for possible H5N1 infection have now been tested at a WHO collaborating laboratory in the United Kingdom. Positive H5N1 results were obtained for seven of these patients. Five cases were fatal.\n\nToday is an official holiday in Azerbaijan. The government will issue an official statement on the situation shortly.\n\nSix of the cases occurred in Salyan Rayon in the south-eastern part of the country. All six cases resided in the small Daikyand settlement of around 800 homes.\n\nA 17-year-old girl died on 23 February. Her first cousin, a 20-year-old woman, died on 3 March. The 16-year-old brother of this woman died on 10 March. A 17-year-old girl, a close friend of the family, died on 8 March. All four of these cases lived together or near each other. The source of their infection is presently under investigation.\n\nThe additional two cases in Salyan involve a 10-year-old boy, who has recovered, and a 15-year-old girl, who is hospitalized in critical condition.\n\nThe seventh case occurred in a 21-year-old woman from the western rayon of Tarter. She died on 9 March.\n\nTwo additional patients, from Salyan and the adjacent rayon of Neftchela, have been hospitalized with symptoms of bilateral pneumonia. Testing of these patients is presently under way.\n\nLast week, WHO strengthened its field team in Azerbaijan to include experts in clinical management and infection control and additional senior epidemiologists.\n\nOver the weekend, a field investigation in Salyan, jointly conducted by WHO and the Azeri Ministry of Health, found some evidence that carcasses of numerous swans, dead for some weeks but not buried, may have been collected by residents as a source of feathers. In this community, the defeathering of birds is a task usually undertaken by adolescent girls and young women. The WHO team is today investigating whether this practice may have been the source of infection in Daikyand, where the majority of cases have occurred in females between the ages of 15 and 20 years. Interviews with surviving family members have failed to uncover a history of direct exposure to dead or diseased poultry for several of the cases.\n\nExcellent collaboration between the Ministry of Health and the WHO team continues. WHO is confident that ongoing house-to-house surveillance for cases of influenza-like illness, undertaken by more than 90 local medical teams in Salyan and Tarter, will detect patients requiring further investigation. On-site diagnostic capacity continues to be provided by the US Naval Medical Research Unit 3 (NAMRU-3). A better understanding of the situation in animals is, however, urgently needed.",

        "Description of the Situation": "17 March 2006\n\nChikungunya in La R\u00e9union (France), Mayotte, Maurice, Seychelles and India \n\nFrom 5 March 2005 - 17 March 2006, 3115 cases of chikungunya have been notified by 31 physicians from a sentinel network on La R\u00e9union, including 196 cases reported during the week 27 February - 5 March 2006. Estimations from a mathematical model evaluate that 204 000 people may have been infected by chikungunya virus since March 2005 on La R\u00e9union, including 13 000 persons during the week 27 February - 5 March 2006. Between 1 January 2006 - 5 March 2006, 25 patients with clinical symptoms consistent with dengue fever were laboratory confirmed. Five were isolated cases and 20 were suspected cases of co-infection chikungunya-dengue.\n\nSince the beginning of January 2006, other countries in the south west Indian Ocean have reported chikungunya cases: Mayotte (9 January - 10 March, 2833 suspected cases), Mauritius (1 January - 5 March c. 6000 suspected cases including 1200 confirmed cases), and the Seychelles (1 January - 26 February, 8818 suspected cases).\n\nSeveral European countries have reported imported cases in people returning from these islands: France (160 imported cases), Germany, Italy, Norway and Switzerland.\n\nA mixed outbreak of chikungunya, with sporadic cases of dengue has been reported in Andhra Pradesh state, India. Between 1 December 2005 - 17 February 2006, 5671 cases of fever with arthralgia were reported. High density of Aedes aegypti was observed in the area. From 1-15 March, over 2000 cases of chikungunya have been reported from Malegaon town in Nasik district, Maharashtra state, India. In Orissa state, India, 4904 cases of fever associated with myalgia and headache have been reported between 27 February - 5 March 2006. These signs are consistent with an arbovirus outbreak. Results of a biological investigation are awaited.\n\nDengue in Madagascar and Maldives\n\nMadagascar has reported a dengue outbreak in the port city of Toamasina. The outbreak started mid-January 2006. Sporadic cases of chikungunya have been reported since mid-February.\n\nMaldives has experienced an outbreak of dengue since January 2006, with 602 suspected cases until 5 March 2006 (including 64 cases of dengue haemorrhagic fever and 9 cases of dengue shock syndrome).\n\nChikungunya and dengue viruses are transmitted to humans by the bites of infected mosquitoes. On La R\u00e9union, Mauritius, the Seychelles and the east coast of Madagascar, Aedes aegypti is absent or scarce in the vicinity of houses. In contrast, Ae. albopictus is abundant and may be the only important vector of these viruses on the islands. In the Maldives Ae. aegypti is the presumed vector. Both species bite mainly during the daytime, particularly in the early hours after dawn and for 2-3 hours before darkness. Aedes albopictus is more active outdoors whereas Ae. aegypti typically feeds and rests more indoors.\n\nMosquito control is the main outbreak control activity. Close to habitation, these two mosquito species multiply in collections of stagnant water, mostly in artificial containers. To control the mosquitoes, their breeding sites must be removed, destroyed, protected, frequently emptied and cleaned, or treated with insecticides. During epidemics, insecticides are also often applied as space sprays to kill the adult mosquitoes.\n\nSuch measures require the mobilization of affected communities to carry out critical, well-identified healthy behaviours. The Communications for Behavioural Impact (COMBI) approach is a powerful strategy to support this mobilization process both in individuals and communities.\n\nControl measures\n\nA WHO team from the Regional Office for Africa and from headquarters was deployed to the south west Indian Ocean in February-March 2006 to assess the control measures under way in the islands and to discuss a sub-regional coordinated strategy for surveillance and control of arboviruses in the area with national authorities. (see previous report). Additional expertise in the COMBI approach has been sent to Madagascar and Mauritius for follow-up. Similarly, Maldives has received support for their social mobilization activities on dengue vector control.\n\nIn India, a multidisciplinary national team was deployed from 13 -17 February 2006 to assist local health authorities in improving public health measures including strengthening of arbovirus surveillance, clinical management of cases, vector control and social mobilization.\n\nAlthough transmission of chikungunya and dengue is continuing in the affected areas, WHO recommends no special restrictions on travel or trade to or from these areas. However, it is recommended that individuals take precautions to protect themselves from mosquito bites, e.g., by wearing clothes that minimize skin exposure and applying insect repellents to exposed skin or clothing in accordance with label instructions.\n\nFor more information about chikungunya and the outbreak on La R\u00e9union, please see the web site of the Observatoire R\u00e9gional de la Sant\u00e9 de La R\u00e9union and the web site of the  Institut National de Veille Sanitaire\n\nFor more information on COMBI please see the web site of the WHO Mediterranean Centre for Vulnerability Reduction (WMC) in Tunis\n\nFor more information on see the WHO dengue web site\n\nFor more information on  pesticides and their application for the control of Aedes mosquitoes and other public health pests.\n\nFor more information on vector control and the use of pesticides, please see the web site of the WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme.",

        "Description of the Situation": "14 March 2006\n\nThe Ministry of Health in Azerbaijan has reported its first three cases of human infection with the H5 subtype of avian influenza virus. All three cases were fatal.\n\nTesting was conducted using a portable PCR field laboratory provided by the US Naval Medical Research Unit 3 (NAMRU-3) based in Cairo, Egypt. NAMRU equipment and staff arrived in Azerbaijan on Monday to strengthen a WHO team that has been in the country since late February.\n\nNAMRU-3 serves as a WHO collaborating centre for emerging infections. Test results are considered reliable.\n\nIn line with WHO policy, arrangements have been made to send samples to a WHO collaborating laboratory in the United Kingdom for diagnostic verification and further analysis. WHO will adjust the figures in its cumulative table of confirmed cases following the results of this external verification. Test results from the UK are expected later this week.\n\nH5N1 is the only strain within the H5 subtype known to cause human infections. It is highly likely that the H5N1 strain will be detected in further tests.\n\nTwo of the cases were from the south-eastern rayon of Salyan, but resided in different settlements. The cases occurred in a 17-year-old girl, from Sarvan settlement, who died on 23 February, and a 20-year-old woman, from Daikyand settlement, who died on 3 March. Poultry deaths have been observed in the settlements in recent weeks, but the cause of death has not yet been determined.\n\nThe third case occurred in a 21-year-old woman from the central-western province of Tarter. She died on 9 March.\n\nHighly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza was first reported in the country, in wild birds, on 9 February. Outbreaks in poultry were reported on 24 February, but not in the Salyan or Tarter rayons.\n\nThe WHO team, which was augmented on Monday, is currently investigating the situation in close collaboration with the Ministry of Health. Heightened surveillance throughout the country has resulted in the detection of some additional patients with severe pneumonia, including some recent fatalities. Strengthened diagnostic capacity within the country is expected to expedite the detection or exclusion of additional cases.\n\nThe Ministry of Health has already introduced a good system of patient notification, transportation, treatment in isolation, and tracing and management of contacts. Daily house-to-house surveillance for cases continues.",

        "Description of the Situation": "10 March 2006\n\nSince the beginning of March, the Ministry of Health in Azerbaijian has been investigating a cluster of 10 persons placed under observation for possible infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus. All of these persons are from the Daikyand settlement in Salyan Rayon in the eastern part of the country.\n\nThe Salyan Rayon is located near wetlands frequented by migratory birds. Recent deaths of poultry have been reported in the Daikyand settlement, but the cause of these deaths has not yet been determined. The investigation was launched when two young women, who were neighbours, died within a week of each other. The first patient, a 17-year-old girl, died on 23 February. She was reported to have suffered for more than a year from respiratory symptoms associated with a neoplastic condition. Her death is now thought to have been caused by this pre-existing disease. As a precaution, samples have been taken and will be sent for H5N1 testing at a WHO collaborating laboratory in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe second death occurred on 3 March in a 20-year-old woman who died following rapidly progressive acute pneumonia, which is a characteristic feature in many cases of H5N1 infection.\n\nImmediately following the second death, the Ministry of Health initiated daily house-to-house investigations, conducted by four teams of hospital staff, looking for persons in the settlement having respiratory symptoms or fever. As a result, an additional 8 persons were hospitalized for observation. Of these, six showed only mild symptoms. They have fully recovered and have now been discharged from hospital.\n\nOf the remaining two patients, one, a 17-year-old girl, died on 8 March. A 16-year-old boy remains hospitalized in isolation. His condition is critical.\n\nThe response of the Ministry of Health has been prompt and efficient, but hampered by the lack of some essential equipment and supplies and inadequate diagnostic capacity. Prior to the event, staff from the Ministry of Health had visited offices of sanitary hygiene and epidemiology in each rayon within the country, creating a high level of awareness of the disease and a correspondingly high level of alert for possible cases of unusual respiratory disease. The house-to-house surveillance for cases is continuing.\n\nA WHO team is presently in Azerbaijan to assess needs and provide technical support to health officials. The team will be augmented on Monday with additional expertise and supplies, including laboratory equipment and diagnostic reagents. Samples have been collected by local officials and shipment to the WHO-affiliated laboratory is expected to take place early next week. Supplies of the antiviral drug oseltamivir are available in Azerbaijan, but the quantity is limited. To date, all patients under investigation have received treatment with this drug.\n\nHighly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza was initially confirmed in Azerbaijan on 9 February in wild birds found in the coastal area near the capital city of Baku. On 24 February, the country announced detection of infection in poultry at farms in Khyzy (in the north-eastern part of the country) and Bilasuvar (near Salyan). Some 300,000 birds were culled as a result.",

        "Description of the Situation": "9 March 2006\n\nOfficials in Germany have today confirmed H5N1 infection in a second mammalian species, the stone marten. This finding marks the first documented infection of this species with an avian influenza virus. Previously, H5N1 infection was confirmed in Germany in three domestic cats.\n\nThe marten was found alive, but showing signs of severe illness, on the Baltic island of Ruegen on 2 March. The animal was euthanized. Tests conducted at Germany\u2019s Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut for Animal Health confirmed infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus.\n\nThe ill animal was found in the same heavily affected area of the island, near Schaprode, as three dead domestic cats. Tests conducted at the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut subsequently confirmed that all three cats were infected with the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus. The stone marten is a predatory nocturnal mammal with feeding habits similar to those of domestic cats. As with the cats found on Ruegen island, the marten is presumed to have acquired its infection after feeding on an infected bird.\n\nSince 16 February, German authorities have confirmed H5N1 infection in 125 wild swans, ducks, geese, and birds of prey on Ruegen Island, pointing to considerable opportunities for exposures to occur in small mammals that feed on birds.\n\nAs is the case with humans, infections in animal species other than birds are rare events. To date, only domestic poultry are known to have played a role in the transmission cycle of the virus from animals to humans.\n\nIn July 2005, tests on three rare Owston\u2019s palm civets that died in captivity in Viet Nam detected H5N1 infection, marking the first known infection in this mammalian species. Large cats, including tigers and leopards, kept in capacity and fed on infected poultry carcasses, have also been infected and developed severe disease. Ferrets are another mammalian species known to be susceptible to infection.\n\nFurther investigation is needed to determine whether evidence of H5N1 infection in new mammalian species has any significance for the risk of human infection or the potential of this virus to adapt to mammals, including humans.",

        "Description of the Situation": "28 February 2006\n\nAuthorities in Germany have today announced detection of H5N1 avian influenza in a domestic cat. The cat was found dead over the weekend on the northern island of Ruegen. Since mid-February, more than 100 wild birds have died on the island, and tests have confirmed H5N1 infection in several.\n\nThere is no present evidence that domestic cats play a role in the transmission cycle of H5N1 viruses. To date, no human case has been linked to exposure to a diseased cat. No outbreaks in domestic cats have been reported.\n\nUnlike the case in domestic and wild birds, there is no evidence that domestic cats are a reservoir of the virus. All available evidence indicates that cat infections occur in association with H5N1 outbreaks in domestic or wild birds.\n\nExperimental studies, published in September 2004, demonstrated that the H5N1 virus can infect domestic cats, and that cats can transmit the virus to other cats. In these experiments, the cats developed disease following direct inoculation of virus isolated from a fatal human case, and following the feeding of infected raw chicken.\n\nThe current H5N1 panzootic in birds, which began in mid-2003 in parts of South-East Asia, has been accompanied by a few anecdotal reports of H5N1 infection in domestic cats. In all such reports, eating raw infected poultry was considered the most likely source of infection for the cats.\n\nSeveral published studies have demonstrated H5N1 infection in large cats kept in captivity. In December 2003, two tigers and two leopards, fed on fresh chicken carcasses, died unexpectedly at a zoo in Thailand. Subsequent investigation identified H5N1 in tissue samples.\n\nIn February 2004, the virus was detected in a clouded leopard that died at a zoo near Bangkok. A white tiger died from infection with the virus at the same zoo in March 2004.\n\nIn October 2004, captive tigers fed on fresh chicken carcasses began dying in large numbers at a zoo in Thailand. Altogether 147 tigers out of 441 died of infection or were euthanized. Subsequent investigation determined that at least some tiger-to-tiger transmission of the virus occurred.",

        "Description of the Situation": "22 February 2006\n\nThe outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza in poultry, confirmed at a commercial farm in Kaduna State on 8 February, has now spread to commercial farms in several other contiguous states. No human cases have been detected to date.\n\nNigerian officials have confirmed outbreaks at commercial farms in the states of Kano, Plateau, Katsina, and Bauchi, and in the Abuja area. Outbreaks have also been detected at more farms in Kaduna. Outbreaks in additional states are currently under investigation.\n\nTo date, four patients with respiratory symptoms and a history of exposure to diseased poultry have been investigated for possible infection. This number includes a woman who died of an acute respiratory illness on 16 February. The three remaining patients are all in good condition.\n\nArrangements are being made to send samples from all four patients for testing at a WHO collaborating laboratory in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe initial outbreak in Kaduna state is now known to have begun on 10 January, raising the possibility that earlier human exposures and cases may have occurred in that area and elsewhere. At hospitals in Kaduna, Kano, and Katsina near affected farms, staff from the WHO-led teams have now examined hundreds of patient records, searching for possible cases that may have occurred earlier. No such cases have been identified to date.\n\nThe scale of the outbreak in birds is not yet fully understood. Most investigations have followed poultry deaths on large commercial farms, where outbreaks are highly visible. Little is known about the presence of the virus in small backyard flocks, where the greatest risk of human exposures and infections resides.\n\nNigeria has an estimated poultry population of around 140 million birds, largely concentrated in the south-western part of the country. As is the case in several affected parts of South-east Asia, around 60% of Nigeria\u2019s poultry production takes place in small backyard flocks. Large-scale commercial farming of poultry occurs mainly in the northern states, where outbreaks have been confirmed.\n\nRapid spread of the virus within Nigeria has raised concern over possible spread to neighbouring countries. Borders are porous and restrictions on the movement of people and poultry are difficult to enforce. WHO staff at offices in these countries are monitoring the situation closely in collaboration with government officials. Rumours of possible human cases in neighbouring countries are also being closely monitored.",

        "Description of the Situation": "21 February 2006\n\nRapid geographical spread of the virus\n\nThe occurrence of the disease in India, reported on 18 February, is part of a recent pattern of rapid geographical spread of the virus in wild and domestic birds. India is one of 13 countries that have reported their first cases of H5N1 infection in birds since the beginning of February. (The 13 countries, listed in order of reporting, are Iraq, Nigeria, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Greece, Italy, Slovenia, Iran, Austria, Germany, Egypt, India and France.)\n\nOn 20 February, Malaysia reported a fresh outbreak in poultry after having been considered free of the disease for more than a year.\n\nThe situation in these recently affected countries varies greatly. Most European countries with good veterinary surveillance have detected the virus in a small number of wild birds only, with no evidence to date of spread to domestic birds.\n\nIn Azerbaijan, detection of the virus has coincided with die-offs of domestic birds. In Egypt, outbreaks in domestic poultry have now been confirmed in 10 governorates; deaths have also been reported in exotic zoo birds. In Iraq, presence of the virus in birds was found only after the country confirmed its first human case.\n\nIn Nigeria, as in India, the first cases were detected in large commercial farms, where the disease is highly visible and outbreaks are difficult to miss.\n\nApart from Iraq, none of the countries newly affected during February has reported human cases. Iraq has reported two human cases, both of which were fatal; samples from several other patients are currently undergoing tests.\n\nFor human health, experience elsewhere over the past two years has shown that the greatest risk of cases arises when the virus becomes established in small backyard flocks, which allow continuing opportunities for close human contact, exposures, and infections to occur.\n\nAll available evidence indicates that the virus does not spread easily from poultry to humans. To date, very few cases have been detected in poultry workers, cullers, or veterinarians. Almost all cases have been linked to close contact to diseased household flocks, often during slaughtering, defeathering, butchering, and preparation of poultry for consumption.\n\nNo cases have been linked to the consumption of properly cooked poultry meat or eggs, even in households where disease was known to be present in flocks.",

The disease was detected at several commercial farms in the Navapur sub-district in the western state of Maharashtra.\n\nPrior to that date, large numbers of poultry deaths, at more than 50 farms in the area, had been noted, but the cause was initially diagnosed as Newcastle disease. The outbreak is now thought to have begun on 27 January. Agricultural authorities have reported that some backyard farms are also affected.\n\nMass culling of bird at affected farms continued today.\n\nThe Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has despatched rapid response teams to Navapur and neighbouring areas. House-to-house searches for cases of influenza-like illness are being conducted.\n\nThe government has equipped a Navapur hospital for the management, in isolation, of possible human cases. WHO was informed today that 12 patients with fever and respiratory illness in Navapur sub-district have been hospitalized for observation as a precautionary measure. An additional 3 patients have been hospitalized, also for observation, in the Vaira sub-district of the adjacent Gujarat state.\n\nSamples from these patients and their close contacts are being tested at the country\u2019s National Institute of Virology.

Estimations from a mathematical model indicate that 110 000 people may have been infected by chikungunya virus since March 2005 in La R\u00e9union, including 22 000 persons during the week 6 to 12 February. During the first week of February, other countries in the south west Indian Ocean have reported cases: Mauritius (206 cases) and the Seychelles (1 255 cases).\n\nBecause of the extensive outbreaks in the region, WHO is planning to send a team from the Regional Office for Africa (AFRO) and headquarters to assess the control measures under way. These include anti-vectoral activities; an extensive public health education campaign using mass media to sensitize the population about protective measures; and reinforcement of epidemiological surveillance and vectoral surveillance. The team will discuss a sub-regional strategy for surveillance and control of chikungunya and other arboviruses with national authorities. They will visit La R\u00e9union, Madagascar, Mauritius and coordinate with the AFRO vector control mission to the Seychelles.\n\nChikungunya, a viral disease, is transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes, typically Aedes aegypti, although there may be other competent mosquito vectors. The name, chickungunya, comes from the Swahili for stooped walk, reflecting the physique of a person suffering from the disease. The disease has been described in Africa, South-East Asia, southern India and Pakistan. It occurs principally during the rainy season.\n\nChikungunya is rarely fatal. Symptoms appear between 4 and 7 days after the patient has been bitten by the infected mosquito. A high fever and headache occur, with significant pains in the joints (ankles, wrists) and can persist for several weeks. The main preventive measure is to stop the proliferation of mosquitoes by reducing their breeding grounds.\nFor more information\n\n\nObservatoire R\u00e9gional de la Sant\u00e9 de La R\u00e9union",

Confirmed outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 in poultry were reported in the area on 2 February.\n\nThe team has met with officials in the country\u2019s ministries of health and agriculture and is now assessing the situation in hospitals, laboratories, and animals. A list of immediate needs for support has been established.\n\nGovernment officials have expressed a need for emergency supplies and equipment, including antiviral drugs, and these have already begun to arrive in the country. A 24-hour emergency operations centre has been set up in the WHO regional office in Cairo to facilitate coordination and provide back-up support.\n\nThe transportation of patient samples for diagnostic confirmation has encountered difficulties. Ways to strengthen local testing capacity are being explored together with ways to expedite the shipment of samples to WHO reference laboratories. The team has noted a need to upgrade biosafety standards in local and national laboratories.\n\nIntensive culling of poultry is under way in the area; improved diagnostic capacity for poultry is needed to focus these efforts better. Training to enhance the diagnostic capacity of veterinary laboratories and improve surveillance has already begun. Requests for essential supplies, including diagnostic reagents, are being met.\n\nThe area has around 1.3 million poultry mainly raised by individual households, who depend on these animals for income and food. Discussions are under way to develop a compensation scheme that could lessen the hardship on these families.\n\nThe team found a good system in place for detecting and managing possible human cases, collecting specimens, and tracing and monitoring contacts. Some improvements in isolation wards are planned. Intensive training courses are being organized for hospital staff to ensure that proper measures for personal protection and infection control are in place.\n\nTwo patients hospitalized for observation have been discharged, though their condition continues to be monitored by local health teams. At present, 7 patients are being treated, in isolation, at hospitals in the area. Most of these patients have reported a history of direct contact with diseased poultry.\n\nIn addition to the confirmed fatal case, two patients under investigation for possible H5N1 infection have died. Specimens from one of these, the 39-year-old uncle of the confirmed case, have tested positive for H5N1 infection in a local laboratory; his infection has not yet been confirmed by a WHO reference laboratory.\n\nA possible H5N1 case in the southern part of the country has been officially reported to WHO by the Ministry of Health. The case, a 13-year-old boy from the Omara area, developed symptoms on 1 February, was hospitalized with severe pneumonia on 5 February, and died the same day. Although no poultry deaths have been reported in the area, pet birds kept by the family are said to have died near the time of symptom onset.\n\nSamples from the boy have been taken. The Minister of Health and a team from the country\u2019s Centre for Disease Control will visit the Omara area tomorrow to investigate.",

She developed fever on 12 January and was hospitalized with symptoms of pneumonia. Authorities say her condition deteriorated rapidly, and she died on 23 January.\n\nInformation provided to WHO indicates that she was self-employed in a shop selling dry goods. No information on possible exposure to diseased birds as the source of her infection is presently available, but an investigation is under way. Close contacts have been placed under medical observation.\n\nThis is the second human case reported this year in China, both from Sichuan Province. The two Sichuan cases occurred in different prefectures located around 150 km apart. A confirmed outbreak of H5N1 in poultry began in late December in another part of the province. No outbreaks have been confirmed in the areas where the two human cases resided.\n\nDuring 2005, Chinese agricultural authorities reported 32 outbreaks in poultry in 12 provinces, resulting in the culling of more than 24 million birds. The appearance of human cases in areas without reported poultry outbreaks is a cause for concern. WHO recommends that, in China, testing for possible H5N1 infection should be undertaken in all cases of severe respiratory disease having no alternative diagnosis, even when no poultry outbreak has been reported in the patient\u2019s area of residence.\n\nOf the ten cases confirmed in China, seven have been fatal. The cases have occurred in 7 provinces and regions: Anhui, Guangxi, Liaoning, Jiangxi, Fujian, Hunan, and Sichuan. No poultry outbreaks have been officially reported in two of these provinces.",

The case is a 4-year-old boy from the district of Dogubayazit in Agri Province in the eastern part of the country. An outbreak in poultry began in the district in December 2005. The child developed symptoms on 5 January and was hospitalized on 13 January. He is being treated at a hospital in Erzurum Province.\n\nLike the two cases confirmed on 16 January, also from Dogubayazit, exposure in this case occurred prior to the government\u2019s launch of an intensive public education campaign. Rapid surveys conducted in the most severely affected eastern part of the country have found an almost universal awareness of the disease and of the risk factors for infection. This awareness has been accompanied by behavioural changes that are expected to reduce opportunities for human infections to occur.\n\nAs the virus is now known to be present in birds in many parts of the country, some additional human cases should be anticipated in the immediate future. The number of these cases is, however, expected to decline as high-risk behaviours become less common and culling operations, which are presently under way, reduce the number of infected birds.\n\nThe newly confirmed case brings the total in Turkey to 21. Of these cases, four were fatal. All four were residents of Dogubayazit.\n\nA second shipment of laboratory specimens arrived yesterday at a WHO collaborating laboratory in the United Kingdom. Apart from providing diagnostic confirmation, the laboratory will undertake viral characterization and genetic and antigenic analyses of viruses. These studies help determine whether the virus is evolving. Antigenic analysis of the virus helps ensure that work on the development of a pandemic vaccine stays on track. Initial results are expected later this week.",

        "Description of the Situation": "12 January 2006\n\nLaboratory tests conducted in Turkey have confirmed detection of the H5 subtype of avian influenza virus in samples from an additional two patients. The patients are residents of Sanliurfa Province, near the southern border with Syria, and Siirt Province, which is adjacent to Van in the eastern part of the country. Human cases have now been reported from nine of the country\u2019s 81 provinces.\n\nBoth patients are young children, aged four and six years, and both have a documented history of direct contact with diseased birds. In Sanliurfa Province, outbreaks in backyard poultry are now thought to date back to late November 2005. Altogether, agricultural officials have confirmed poultry outbreaks in 11 provinces and are investigating possible outbreaks in an additional 14 provinces across the country.\n\nLaboratory tests completed today in Turkey have detected the H5 virus subtype in post-mortem specimens taken from a 12-year-old girl, from Agri Province, who died 7 January. The child was the sibling of two other patients who died earlier. Their infection with the H5N1 virus was subsequently confirmed by a WHO collaborating laboratory in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe Ministry of Health is now reporting 18 laboratory-confirmed cases, of which three, all from the same family, have been fatal. \n\nArrangements have been made to send specimens from several patients to the UK collaborating laboratory for further analysis. Due to official holidays in Turkey, specimens are not expected to arrive in the UK before Monday. The head of the collaborating laboratory is now in Ankara to support diagnostic work at the country\u2019s national influenza centre. Ways are being sought to expedite the testing of patient samples. High awareness of the disease in the Turkish population, combined with almost daily reports of poultry outbreaks in new areas, has resulted in a large number of people concerned about exposure and seeking reassurance.\n\nThe rapid assessment of patients with a possible exposure history is providing a unique opportunity to learn more about the disease in humans. It is also generating data that can be used to assess the efficacy of antiviral drugs, as most people with an exposure history or respiratory symptoms are receiving oseltamivir either prophylactically or very early after the onset of symptoms. \n\nMembers of the international teams, in Van Province and Ankara, are today working with local experts to plan relevant studies. These studies should deepen understanding of the epidemiology of the disease, including the possibility that any human-to-human transmission may have occurred, the vulnerability to infection of health care workers and other occupationally-exposed groups, and the possibility that milder forms of the disease might be occurring in the general population. \n\nAll available evidence indicates that no sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred. As in Asia, contact with infected birds is the principal source of infection. The risk of infection for travellers to Turkey is negligible provided direct contact with dead or diseased domestic and wild birds is avoided.\nGene sequencing information on human viruses\n\nThe WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on influenza at the MRC National Institute for Medical Research in Mill Hill, London, has today completed genetic and antigenic analyses of viruses recovered from the first two fatal human cases in the Turkish outbreak.\n\nInformation provided to WHO indicates that these viruses are very similar to current avian H5N1 viruses isolated from birds in Turkey. They are also closely related to viruses isolated from the large outbreak in migratory birds that occurred at the Qinghai Lake nature reserve in China, beginning in late April of last year.\n\nThese analyses indicate that the Turkish viruses are sensitive to both classes of antiviral drugs, including oseltamivir and amantadine. WHO and collaborating experts will review the data on amantadine sensitivity. Oseltamivir remains the drug of first choice recommended by WHO.\n\nVirus from one of the patients shows mutations at the receptor-binding site. One of the mutations has been seen previously in viruses isolated from a small outbreak in Hong Kong in 2003 (two cases, one of which was fatal) and from the 2005 outbreak in Viet Nam. Research has indicated that the Hong Kong 2003 viruses bind preferentially to human cell receptors more so than to avian cell receptors. Researchers at the Mill Hill laboratory anticipate that the Turkish virus will also have this characteristic.\n\nInterpretation of the significance of this finding for human health will depend on clinical and epidemiological data now being gathered in Turkey. \n\nAll available evidence indicates that no sustained human-to-human transmission is occurring in any country experiencing human cases. \n\nThe present WHO level of pandemic alert remains at phase 3: human infections with a new virus subtype are occurring, but the vast majority of these infections are acquired directly from animals.",

Although no poultry outbreaks have been officially reported in this province, it is located near areas with confirmed outbreaks in birds.\n\nThe situation in birds continues to evolve, with several new outbreaks under investigation in new parts of the country. All evidence to date indicates that patients have acquired their infections following close contact with diseased birds.\n\nThe Turkish government has launched an intensive public awareness campaign. Better public understanding of the disease, supported by more complete data on disease activity in birds, could help to reduce the risk of additional human cases, pending control of the disease in birds. As the majority of confirmed cases and persons under investigation are children, it is particularly important that messages about high-risk behaviours reach children.\n\nSome 100,000 treatment courses of oseltamivir (Tamiflu) arrived in Turkey Friday evening. This supply, which is being used for both the treatment of patients and prophylaxis of persons at risk, is considered by Turkish health officials to be adequate for responding to the current situation.

Five of these cases were announced by the Ministry of Health yesterday and an additional five were announced today. Most patients are children and all have been hospitalized for treatment and evaluation. \n\nOf the five patients announced on Sunday, three are from Ankara Province and include two brothers, aged five and two years, and a 65-year-old man. All three patients are hospitalized in Ankara. The additional two cases, a nine-year-old girl and her three-year-old brother, are from the Dogubeyazit district in Agri Province, and are hospitalized in the city of Van. \n\nThe five cases announced today are from Kastamonu, Corum, and Samsun provinces, bordering the Black Sea in the north-central part of the country, and from Van Province.\n\nThis brings the total number of cases in Turkey, confirmed by laboratory tests there, to 14. Of these patients, two have died. WHO will add these numbers to its cumulative total following further verification by an external H5 reference laboratory. \n\nThe quality of laboratory testing at Turkey\u2019s National Influenza Centre in Ankara is high. Results from tests conducted there last week were fully confirmed by a WHO collaborating laboratory in the United Kingdom. WHO considers it likely that test results on the newly announced cases will be confirmed by the UK laboratory, where samples are being sent for further analysis. H5N1 is the only strain within the H5 subtype known to infect humans. In the event of a confirmed H5N1 outbreak in birds, it is expected that human cases of avian influenza will be caused by the same virus strain.\n\nThe initial WHO team, accompanied by the Turkish Minister of Health, arrived in Van Province yesterday evening. The team is now investigating the epidemiological situation, assessing risk factors and control measures, and discussing with local authorities the possible need for additional equipment and supplies. The team will also be assessing patients at the Van hospital where some 38 people are currently being treated and evaluated for possible H5N1 infection. \n\nThe initial investigation has found no evidence that the virus has increased its transmissibility or is spreading from person to person. Most persons under investigation are children, often from the same family, and almost all have a documented link to dead or diseased poultry. \n\nOutbreaks in poultry are now known to be occurring in several parts of the country. In recent days, the Ministry of Agriculture has confirmed H5N1 outbreaks in birds in 10 of the country\u2019s 81 provinces. Extensive culling is under way, and several other possible outbreaks are under investigation.\n\nWith the agreement of the Ministry of Health, two epidemiologists and two experts in laboratory diagnosis will join the initial WHO team in the next few days. Given the present high level of awareness of the disease and its presence in poultry in several parts of the country, the number of people concerned about possible exposure is expected to increase. This additional support should expedite understanding of the epidemiological situation and increase the capacity to rapidly confirm or rule out persons under investigation for possible infection.",

Tests on samples from these patients are ongoing; neither is laboratory confirmed at present.\n\nAccording to Turkish authorities, some 30 patients are being treated and evaluated for possible H5N1 infection at a hospital in Van Province. Most of the patients are children, and the majority come from the rural district of Dogubayazit.\n\nPlans for a team of international experts to travel today to Van Province have been deferred because of adverse weather conditions. Government officials are assisting the team in finding a rapid mode of transportation to the affected area in the eastern part of the country.\n\nTo date, all evidence indicates that patients have acquired their infections following close contact with diseased poultry. Contact between people and poultry has likely increased during the present cold weather, when the custom among many rural households is to bring poultry into their homes. Tests have shown that the virus can survive in bird faeces for at least 35 days at low temperatures (4oC).\n\nBased on experiences during the avian H5N1 outbreaks in Asia, behaviours that carry an especially high risk of infection include the slaughtering, defeathering, butchering, and preparation for consumption of diseased poultry. These behaviours tend to occur most frequently in rural areas where populations traditionally slaughter and consume birds once deaths or signs of illness are seen in poultry flocks.\n\nIn recent days, vigilance for outbreaks of the disease in poultry has increased considerably. Outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza have now been confirmed in six provinces in the eastern and south-eastern part of the country. Outbreaks at additional sites in the area are under investigation.\n\nAvoidance of high-risk behaviours remains the most important way for local populations to protect themselves from infection.",

        "Description of the Situation": "5 January 2006\n\nThe Ministry of Health in Turkey has confirmed its first two cases of human infection with avian influenza caused by the H5 virus subtype. Both cases were fatal.\n\n\nThe first case was a 14-year-old boy from the rural district of Dogubayazit, in the eastern province of Agri, which borders the Islamic Republic of Iran and Armenia. He was hospitalized in Van Province on 1 January and died the same day. The second case was his 15-year-old sister, also hospitalized on 1 January. She died on 5 January. \n\nEarlier this week, Turkish authorities had ruled out avian influenza in these cases based on preliminary test results from samples taken from the nose and throat. Subsequent tests of additional patient specimens taken from the lungs produced positive results. Patient samples were sent today to a WHO collaborating centre in the United Kingdom for further analysis. The samples have now arrived; results are expected within the next days.\n\nTurkish health authorities have informed WHO that, since 1 January, a total of 11 patients (including the two confirmed fatal cases) have been hospitalized in Van Province with symptoms suggesting infection with avian influenza. Most patients are children between the ages of six and fifteen years and all reside in the Dogubayazit district. Two of the children are siblings of the two confirmed cases.\n\n\nFollowing a request by the Ministry of Health, an initial team of experts from WHO, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the European Commission is travelling today to Turkey to collaborate with the authorities in their investigation of the situation. \n\nInitial information about the confirmed cases suggests that the children acquired their infection following close contact with chickens. Deaths of chickens are known to have occurred in the Dogubayazit district near the end of last year. Although no poultry outbreak has been officially reported in the district, a confirmed outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza in chickens and ducks was reported on 27 December in the adjacent province of Igdir. \n\nNational authorities have informed WHO that Dogubayazit district has been placed under quarantine; no people or animals are allowed to move in or out of the district. Culling operations are currently under way.\n\nThe two Turkish cases mark the first confirmed reports of human infection with avian influenza outside East Asia. Since January 2004, a total of 142 human cases of H5N1 infection have been reported in Viet Nam, Thailand, Cambodia, Indonesia, and China. The cases in Turkey bring the number of affected countries to six, from which 144 cases have now been reported. \n\nTurkey reported its first outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza in poultry in mid-October of last year. That outbreak, which occurred in the northwestern part of the country, was attributed to contact between domestic poultry and migratory waterfowl. The outbreak in Igdir and other suspected outbreaks in this part of the country are thought to have occurred following introduction of the virus by migratory birds. The region, which has several large lakes, is known to lie along migratory routes.",
