        "Description of the Situation": "11 November 2011 -\nThe mass lead poisoning from mining activities in Zamfara State in Nigeria, which was discovered in March 2010, continues to affect villagers in three Local Government Areas (LGAs): Anka, Bukkuyum and Maru.\n\nWhile the full scale of the problem is still not fully determined, a survey carried out by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC) at the request of the Nigeria Federal Ministry of Health has revealed at least 43 villages in Zamfara State where there are confirmed cases of lead poisoning (blood lead concentration >10 \u03bcg/dL). In at least seven of these villages there are children who need chelation therapy (blood lead concentration >45 \u03bcg/dL). This is in addition to the seven villages that have now been remediated. \n\nWith the combined effects of removal from lead exposure and chelation and other supportive therapy, the mortality rate among exposed children in seven remediated villages has dropped from 43% in 2010 to 1% in 2011. \nActions taken\n\nWHO and multiple partners have been assisting state and federal authorities to manage the situation, which cannot be resolved without sustained changes to mining practices to prevent further environmental contamination with lead. These include relocation of ore processing activities and storage of ore materials away from villages, the adoption of new processing methods that produce less dust, as well as hygiene measures such as removing contaminated clothes and washing before returning home. \n\nWHO is continuing to advocate with the Government in Nigeria for their attention to this problem and to gain their commitment to further sustained action to prevent the serious and life-long consequences of lead poisoning in a generation of children in Zamfara. \n\nThe response to the mass lead poisoning in Zamfara State has involved multiple agencies, including WHO, United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) - Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) Joint Environment Unit, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), the US CDC, the Blacksmith Institute, TerraGraphics Environmental Engineering Inc, and the Artisanal Gold Council, working with authorities and leaders at community, state and federal level. \n\nWith funding of US$ 1.9 million provided by the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to WHO and UNICEF, the following activities have been carried out:\n\nremediation of five villages (Abare, Tungar Guru, Tungar Daji, Sunke and Duza);\nsocial mobilization and community awareness activities directed at informing local communities about the hazards of lead and how to prevent lead exposure, including safer mining and gold extraction processes;\nadvocacy activities with state and federal authorities, and community leaders;\nestablishment of a surveillance system for the early detection of lead poisoning in Zamfara State;\nprovision of three hand-held x-ray fluorescence devices for the rapid measurement of lead concentrations in soil;\nprovision of four point-of-care analyzers and their kits for the rapid measurement of blood lead concentrations;\nprovision of a graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometer, ancillary equipment and reagents, as well as technical advice, for the establishment of a reference laboratory for the measurement of lead;\ntraining for doctors, nursing and laboratory staff at the planned lead treatment centre in Gusau on the diagnosis and management of lead poisoning;\nprovision of antidotal agents for the treatment of lead poisoning; \nco-ordination of partners involved in the response activities.\n\n\nThe remediation work has been organized by the Blacksmith Institute and TerraGraphics Environmental Engineering Inc, working with the Zamfara State authorities and local contractors. Remediation has involved the identification of contaminated areas in the villages, removal of all contaminated soil, its disposal in secure landfill sites and its replacement with clean soil. In addition walls and other surfaces in family compounds have been cleaned. A total of seven villages have now been remediated, two having been completed before the CERF funding was available. TerraGraphics has provided training in assessment and remediation procedures so that they can be continued by local agencies. \n\nMSF has continued to provide chelation therapy for lead-poisoned children in the decontaminated villages and now has over 2\u00a0000 children under five years of age on its treatment programme. \nOngoing challenges\n\nThis serious environmental emergency cannot be resolved quickly. Remediation is a challenging and time-consuming task. Children have to wait for their family compounds to be cleaned before they can start treatment, and some children will require chelation for many months. Persuading people to adopt new practices and behaviours requires continuing effort. In addition, capacities within Nigeria for the diagnosis and management of lead poisoning need further strengthening and support. A further challenge is the purchase of sufficient chelating agents: these are expensive drugs that are not available as generics. There is therefore a need for long-term engagement on the part of leaders and authorities at community, state and federal levels in Nigeria, as well as health and environment professionals, technical partners and donors. \n\nOf particular concern is the town of Bagega in Anka Local Government Area, which is a regional hub for ore processing and the informal gold trade. Many family compounds and communal areas in the town have soil lead concentrations above 1\u00a0000 ppm (400 ppm is the limit in the USA for areas where there are children), and it is estimated that 1\u00a0500 young children may be poisoned with lead. Before these children can be treated they must have a clean environment to live in. There is therefore an urgent need to decontaminate Bagega and the other villages and to provide chelation and other therapy.",

        "Description of the Situation": "7 OCTOBER 2011 - In 2011 several large measles outbreaks have been reported from Member States in the European and African regions, with several reported outbreaks in the Americas linked to Europe or Africa.\n\n\nEurope:  As of 20 September 2011, 40 of 53 Member States in the WHO European Region have reported 26 025 confirmed measles cases for the period January \u2013 July 2011 to the WHO European Regional Office through routine surveillance and outbreak reports. The highest number of cases was reported from France with 14 025 cases for the first six months of the year. In addition, eleven of all cases in the Region were lethal (6 in France and one in each of Germany, Kyrgyzstan, Romania, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the United Kingdom). The predominant genotype currently circulating in the European Region is D4, the same endemic genotype from the United Kingdom in 2008. The most recent outbreak was reported from Israel in September, with 12 cases. Member States have responded to the outbreak by modifying the vaccination schedule, like France, or by offering vaccination free of charge or in schools, to increase accessibility to and availability of vaccines.\n\nAfrica: The Regional Office reports that as of September 2011 large measles outbreaks are being reported by the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with over 103 000 cases, Nigeria, with 17 428 cases, and Zambia, with 5 397 cases, and Ethiopia, with 2 902 cases. Even though deaths are not routinely reported to the Regional Office, the WHO Country Office in the Democratic Republic of the Congo reports over 1100 measles-associated deaths in the country during 2011. \n\nAmericas: The last case of endemic measles was reported from the region in 2002. In 2011 the Region has received reports of several outbreaks linked to importation of measles virus from other regions. The largest, in Quebec, Canada, involves 742 reported cases, 89 requiring hospitalization, but no measles-associated deaths. Other outbreaks have been reported from the United States (213 cases), Ecuador (41 cases), Brazil (18 cases), Columbia (7 cases), Mexico (3 cases), and Chile (6 cases). Most of these outbreaks are linked to importations from Europe, except for outbreaks in the United States and Chile linked to cases from Malaysia and the outbreak in Ecuador, linked to Kenya.\n\nMeasles is a highly infectious disease that causes complications and deaths, even in previously-healthy individuals, but is fully preventable by vaccination. Countries need to ensure that they reach 95% coverage with two doses of measles vaccine across all age groups up to 15 years of age. Otherwise the country will experience measles outbreaks with large numbers of cases, associated hospitalizations and deaths. The recent outbreaks in countries with high volumes of international travellers can lead to measles exportation to regions previously free of measles, such as the Region of the Americas or certain African countries. These exportations can lead to large outbreaks and associated deaths.\n\nThese outbreaks should remind travellers that they should ensure that they have had two doses of measles-containing vaccine before their trip.",

The outbreak has been reported to have spread to new locations, particularly in Kinshasa, where there are large population groups with inadequate safe water.\n\nIn response to the outbreaks, the governments of DRC and the Republic of Congo, international organizations and non-government organizations have intensified surveillance, case management and health promotion activities in the affected areas, in addition to setting up cholera treatment centres at selected sites. \n\nIn DRC, WHO is conducting a rapid risk assessment to identify urgent needs for the coming weeks. Two epidemiologists, a health promotion officer and a logistician have been deployed to Kinshasa to support the response operations.",

        "Location": "Pakistan",
        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "7 July 2011 -\nPakistan has reported wild poliovirus type 3 (WPV3) isolated from a 16-month old child with onset of paralysis on 9 June 2011, from a conflict-affected, inaccessible area of Khyber Agency, Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). This is the only case of WPV3 detected in Asia in 2011. WPV3 transmission in Asia is on the verge of elimination, with the last case occurring more than six months ago, on 18 November 2010 (also from Khyber Agency, FATA). \n\nConfirmation of continuation of WPV3 transmission in tribal areas of Pakistan has significant implications for the global effort to eradicate WPV3, particularly as Asia is on the verge of eliminating circulation of this strain. The detection of WPV3 in Pakistan represents the risk that it may spread from this transmission focus to other WPV3-free areas of Asia and beyond. Globally, WPV3 transmission is at historically low levels in 2011, with other circulation of this strain restricted to parts of west Africa (17 cases in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Guinea, Mali and Niger), Nigeria (five cases) and Chad (three cases). The risk of onward spread of WPV3 is deemed as high by the World Health Organization (WHO), particularly given large-scale population movements within Pakistan, between Pakistan and Afghanistan, and expected large-scale population movements associated with Umrah and the upcoming Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia) in the coming few months.\n\n\nIn 2011, supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) in Pakistan have been inadequate in quality in key high-risk areas and a significant proportion of children remained inaccessible in conflict affected tribal areas. In FATA, particularly in Khyber agency, nearly 50% of children have been regularly missed during SIAs for the last two years. In addition to challenges relating to reaching children in insecure areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and FATA, significant operational challenges continue to mar the quality of SIAs in accessible areas of Khyber and in other key transmission areas of the country, notably in the provinces of Balochistan and Sindh. In addition to confirmation of the only WPV3 case in Asia in 2011, Pakistan is affected by country-wide geographical transmission of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1), with 57 confirmed WPV1 cases in 2011 (as at 5 July 2011), compared with 14 WPV1 cases for the same period in 2010. \n\nTo urgently address the situation, the Government of Pakistan has this year launched a National Polio Emergency Action Plan, under the auspices of His Excellency the President. However, the Independent Monitoring Board (IMB), set up at the request of the World Health Assembly (WHA) in 2010 to independently monitor progress towards a polio-free world, in April 2011 expressed alarm that the Plan is taking too long to implement, a conclusion echoed by the Technical Advisory Group (TAG) of the Eastern Mediterranean in June 2011. \n\nTo rapidly build up immunity to both wild poliovirus strains, a Short Interval Additional Dose Strategy (SIAD) SIA with bivalent OPV is being conducted in Khyber Agency , the first passage on 4 July and the second on 12 July. It is expected that, as during the most recent SIAs in mid-June, 45% (89,449) of target children in Khyber Agency (80% in Bara Tehsil, i.e. approximately 73,000) will remain inaccessible during the SIADs. National Immunization Days (NIDs) will be conducted in the country on 18-20 July, using bivalent OPV (containing type 1 & 3 serotypes). However, key to success will be to overcome remaining operational challenges in fully-accessible areas and to implement special outreach strategies with full community participation to increase access to populations in security-compromised areas. To minimise the risk of WPV3 re-infecting Afghanistan, Subnational Immunization Days (SNIDs) - including in border areas with Pakistan - will be conducted in the country on 10-12 July, also using bivalent OPV. \n\nIt is important that countries across Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean strengthen disease surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), in order to rapidly detect any poliovirus importations and facilitate a rapid response should importation occur. Countries should also continue to boost routine immunization coverage against all strains of polio to minimize the consequences of any introduction.\n\n\nAs per recommendations outlined in WHO's International travel and health, travellers to and from Pakistan should be fully protected by vaccination. Travellers to Pakistan who have in the past received three or more doses of OPV should be offered another dose of polio vaccine before departure. Any unimmunized individuals intending to travel to Pakistan should complete a full course of vaccination. Travellers from Pakistan should have a full course of vaccination against polio before leaving Pakistan, with a minimum one dose of OPV before departure. Some polio-free countries may also require travellers from Pakistan to be immunized against polio in order to obtain an entry visa. \n\nWith Hajj and Umrah season already started, and Umrah expected to increase during Ramadan (in August) and Hajj in early November, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has vaccination requirements for travellers (all ages) for Umrah and Hajj. These requirements are in line with recommendations outlined in WHO's  International travel and health, with the addition that travellers of all ages from polio endemic countries are required to show proof of vaccination with OPV six weeks before travel to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and will receive a further dose of OPV upon their arrival. \nFor more information\n\n\nGlobal Polio Eradication Initiative \n\nSaudi Arabia Haj requirements for travellers \n\nInternational travel and health",

        "Description of the Situation": "21 April 2011 -\nC\u00f4te d'Ivoire is experiencing an outbreak of wild poliovirus type 3 (WPV3) with three new cases reported with onset of paralysis on 27 January, 24 February and 27 February this year. \n\nGenetic sequencing of the isolated viruses show that they are linked to WPV3 last detected in mid-2008 in northern Nigeria. They are the first WPV3 recorded in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire since 2000. In 2008-2009, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire was affected by a wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) outbreak affecting west Africa (and which was recently stopped). \n\nThere is currently a high risk of further spread of WPV3 - both within and from - C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. It is the first time since 2000 that WPV3 has been recorded in this part of west Africa (WPV3 transmission has been limited to northern Nigeria and parts of Niger, and since 2008 also in parts of Mali and one case in Benin). The outbreak response may be constrained by the current security situation in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. Due to the persistence of subnational surveillance gaps in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and other areas of west Africa, undetected further circulation cannot be ruled out at this time. \n\nDetection of these WPV3 cases underscores the risk suboptimal surveillance poses to the global polio eradication effort. Globally, WPV3 transmission is at its lowest level in history, with only nine cases reported worldwide in 2011 - efforts to rapidly interrupt all remaining chains of WPV3 transmission is a key priority for the global polio eradication effort.\n\nThe overriding priority is to urgently stop the WPV3 outbreak, while maintaining high population immunity across west Africa to WPV1. Two rounds of coordinated, multi-country supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) with bivalent oral polio vaccine (bOPV) and trivalent oral polio vaccine (tOPV) across west Africa have been/are being implemented on 25 March 2011, and again on 29 April 2011, in 15 countries across west Africa (except C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, see next paragraph). A further outbreak response is currently planned in six countries, over and beyond these two multi-country SIAs. Such a further response could see planned SIAs scheduled for the fourth quarter to be brought forward to earlier in the year. \n\nIn C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, the end-March SIA did not take place due to the current security and political situation. A response round is proposed in the affected province using bOPV in late April 2011, to be followed by two National Immunization Days (NIDs), as soon as the situation permits. Planning is underway to ensure capacity (ie technical, vaccine, operational) is in place for this emergency response. Coordination with other United Nations (UN) organizations and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) operating in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire is ongoing, to ensure that OPV is added to any planned immunization activity, in particular for displaced populations. Ongoing transmission will be monitored, and mop-ups implemented as epidemiology dictates.\n\nAn investigation is ongoing to more clearly identify surveillance gaps in the region, including among mobile, migrant and underserved populations. Measures will be implemented to strengthen sub-national surveillance, to ensure that all groups and areas, particularly high-risk populations, are covered by high-quality surveillance. \n\nAs per recommendations outlined in WHO's International travel and health, travellers to and from C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, and other polio-affected countries of west Africa, should be fully protected by vaccination. Travellers who have in the past received three or more doses of OPV should be offered another dose of polio vaccine before departure. Any unimmunized individuals intending to travel to should have a complete course of vaccination. Travellers from C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, and other polio-affected countries of west Africa, should have a full course of vaccination against polio before departure, with a minimum one dose of OPV before departure. \nFor more information\n\n\nGlobal Polio Eradication Initiative",
