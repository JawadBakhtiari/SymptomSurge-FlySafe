        "Description of the Situation": "30 December 2014\n\n \nOn 29 December 2014, WHO was notified by the National IHR Focal Point for the United Kingdom of a laboratory-confirmed case of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD). This is the first EVD case to be detected on UK soil.\nDetails of the case are as follows:\n\nThe case is a female healthcare worker who has returned from volunteering at an Ebola treatment centre in Sierra Leone. The patient flew from Freetown to London via Casablanca, Morocco before reaching Glasgow on 28 December. The case displayed no symptoms of infectious Ebola throughout the journey, but is believed to have become febrile around the time of arrival to London.\n\nAfter feeling unwell with fever and myalgia, the case was admitted to the specialist Brownlee Unit for Infectious Diseases on the Gartnavel Hospital campus in Glasgow and placed into strict isolation on the morning of 29 December. The patient was transferred for treatment in isolation at the Royal Free hospital in London on 30 December 2014. Currently, the patient is in stable condition and remains in isolation.\nPublic health response\n\nA range of public health measures are being implemented by UK authorities with special attention to investigate all possible contacts with the patient during the flight to Scotland via Heathrow. \n\nWHO is in close contact with UK authorities and is facilitating information sharing with involved countries, including Morocco. WHO is ready to further assist as needed.\n\nFuture WHO updates on EVD in the UK will not be posted on the Disease Outbreak News. Further information will be available in the WHO\u2019s Ebola Situation Reports, which provide regular updates on the WHO response:\n\n\nEbola situation reports\n\n\n\nWHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied by countries except in cases where individuals have been confirmed or are suspected of being infected with EVD or where individuals have had contact with cases of EVD. Contacts do not include properly-protected healthcare workers and laboratory staff.\n\nTemporary recommendations from the Emergency Committee with regard to actions to be taken by countries can be found at:\n\n\nStatement on the 1st meeting of the IHR Emergency Committee on the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "Between 8 and 16 December 2014, the National IHR Focal Point for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) notified WHO of 3 additional cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, including 1 death.",
        "Description of the Situation": "26 December 2014\n\n \nBetween 8 and 16 December 2014, the National IHR Focal Point for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) notified WHO of 3 additional cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, including 1 death.\n\nDetails of the cases are as follows:\n\nA 29-year-old, non-national female from Taif city who developed symptoms on 9 December. She sought medical advice on 14 December and was admitted to hospital on 15 December. The patient has no comorbidities. While working as a nurse in an isolation ward, she came into contact with a laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV case. The patient has no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. Currently, she is in stable condition and remains in isolation.\n\nA 70-year-old, non-national male from a village near Jubail city who developed symptoms on 10 December. He was admitted to hospital on 15 December. The patient has comorbidities as well as a history of frequent camel contact and of raw camel products consumption. He has no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. Currently, he is in ICU in critical condition.\n\nA 61-year-old male from Najran city who developed symptoms on 1 December. He was admitted to hospital on 6 December. The patient had comorbidities as well as a history of frequent camel contact and of raw camel products consumption. In the 14 days prior to the onset of symptom, he visited a health care facility that, however, had no links to MERS-CoV cases. He had no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days that preceded the onset of symptoms. The patient was admitted to ICU but passed away on 14 December. \n\n\nContact tracing of household contacts and healthcare contacts is ongoing for these cases. \n\nThe National IHR Focal Point for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia also notified WHO of the death of 1 previously reported MERS-CoV case.\n\nGlobally, the WHO has been notified of 941 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 347 related deaths\nWHO advice\n\nBased on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.\n\nInfection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.\n\nUntil more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS\u2010CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.\n\nFood hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.\n\nWHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.",

So far, the overall risk associated with the H7N9 virus has not changed.\nWHO advice\n\nWHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid poultry farms, or contact with animals in live bird markets, or entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travellers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.\n\nWHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.\n\nWHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, in order to ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005), and continue national health preparedness actions.",

        "Description of the Situation": "21 November 2014\n\n \nOn 4 November 2014, WHO was notified by the Ministry of Health of Madagascar of an outbreak of plague. The first case, a male from Soamahatamana village in the district of Tsiroanomandidy, was identified on 31 August. The patient died on 3 September.\n\nAs of 16 November, a total of 119 cases of plague have been confirmed, including 40 deaths. Only 2% of reported cases are of the pneumonic form.\n\nCases have been reported in 16 districts of seven regions. Antananarivo, the capital and largest city in Madagascar, has also been affected with 2 recorded cases of plague, including 1 death. There is now a risk of a rapid spread of the disease due to the city\u2019s high population density and the weakness of the healthcare system. The situation is further complicated by the high level of resistance to deltamethrin (an insecticide used to control fleas) that has been observed in the country. \nPublic health response\n\nThe national task force has been activated to manage the outbreak. With support from partners \u2013 including WHO, the Pasteur Institute of Madagascar, the \u201cCommune urbaine d\u2019Antananarivo\u201d and the Red Cross \u2013 the government of Madagascar has put in place effective strategies to control the outbreak. Thanks to financial assistance from the African Development Bank, a 200,000 US dollars response project has been developed. WHO is providing technical expertise and human resources support. Measures for the control and prevention of plague are being thoroughly implemented in the affected districts. Personal protective equipment, insecticides, spray materials and antibiotics have been made available in those areas. \nBackground\n\nPlague is a bacterial disease caused by Yersinia pestis, which primarily affects wild rodents. It is spread from one rodent to another by fleas. Humans bitten by an infected flea usually develop a bubonic form of plague, which produces the characteristic plague bubo (a swelling of the lymph node). If the bacteria reach the lungs, the patient develops pneumonia (pneumonic plague), which is then transmissible from person to person through infected droplets spread by coughing. If diagnosed early, bubonic plague can be successfully treated with antibiotics. Pneumonic plague, on the other hand, is one of the most deadly infectious diseases; patients can die 24 hours after infection. The mortality rate depends on how soon treatment is started, but is always very high. \nWHO recommendations \n\nWHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction based on the current information available. In urban areas, such as Antananarivo, the surveillance of epidemic risk indicators is highly recommended for the implementation of preventive vector control activities.",

These are the first cases reported to WHO by Qatar in 2014. \nDetails of the case are as follows:\n\nA 71-year-old male from Doha, Qatar developed symptoms on 1 October while traveling with three family members by car from Qatar to the Al-Hasa Region of Saudi Arabia. On 7 October, as his symptoms worsened, the case visited a private health facility in Al-Hasa, whereupon he was transferred to the Hamad General Hospital in Doha. On 11 October, laboratory tests conducted on the patient confirmed MERS-CoV infection. The case owns a camel barn and is known to have consumed raw camel milk. . The patient has comorbidities and is currently in critical condition.\n\nA 43-year-old male from Doha developed symptoms on 14 October. On 17 and 18 October, he sought care at a health care facility but was not admitted. On 20 October, his condition deteriorated, he was admitted to hospital, and was confirmed positive for MERS-CoV infection on the same day. The patient presented with no comorbidities but he had frequently visited a camel barn in the 14 days that preceded the onset of symptoms. There is no history of exposure to other known risk factors. Currently, the patient is in stable condition.\nPublic health response\n\nHousehold and healthcare contacts of the two cases have been identified and are being followed up. Currently, none of these contacts is symptomatic. Health education messages about appropriate preventive measures have been shared with the household contacts of the two patients. Infection prevention and control measures in all health facilities have been re-enforced by Qatar\u2019s Supreme Council of Health (SCH). Furthermore, the SCH, in collaboration with the Ministry of Environment, is investigating the camels in the two barns.\n\nGlobally, WHO has received notification of 885 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 319 related deaths.\nWHO advice\n\nBased on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.\n\nInfection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.\n\nUntil more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS\u2010CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.\n\nFood hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.\n\nWHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.",

        "Description of the Situation": "6 September 2014\n\n \nIn Cameroon, 2 new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported from the East Region, with onset of paralysis on 26 June 2014 and 9 July 2014. Genetic sequencing of these latest isolated viruses confirms continued wild poliovirus circulation, gaps in surveillance resulting in undetected transmission and geographic expansion to new areas of the country. \n\nThe outbreak in Cameroon has been ongoing since at least October 2013. The outbreak continued into 2014, with international spread to Equatorial Guinea. In March 2014, WHO elevated the risk assessment of international spread of polio from Cameroon to very high, due to expanding circulation and influx of vulnerable refugee populations from Central African Republic (CAR). This risk assessment remains in place. Further undetected circulation in Cameroon cannot be ruled out. Moreover, the risk of virus spreading into CAR is considered to be particularly high given the large-scale population movements from CAR into Cameroon.\n\nIn May 2014, the Director-General of WHO declared the international spread of wild poliovirus to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), under the International Health Regulations. Cameroon is one of the countries that meets the criteria for \u2018states currently exporting wild poliovirus\u2019 and was therefore recommended to implement extraordinary measures to mitigate the risk of further international spread. \n\nCameroon has conducted seven nationwide supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) in 2014. The next subnational SIAs are planned for 23-26 August and 4-7 September in 2 regions (East and Adamaoua ) of the country, aiming to reach children aged less than ten years, and all age groups in formal and informal refugee camps. On 22 August, CAR started a series of five sub-national polio immunization activities that will cover the western half of the country and which will end with the September synchronized round covering the central block countries of the African region.\n\nOutbreak response quality to date in Cameroon has varied by geographic area. The confirmation of new cases and undetected, geographically-expanded spread of transmission, has resulted in planning additional emergency outbreak response activities. Critical to success will be to ensure substantial improvement in the quality campaigns that reach all children multiple times with OPV. Equally important will be efforts to rapidly improve the quality of surveillance so that the full extent of the outbreak can be determined and tracked.\n\nIt is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis cases in order to rapidly detect any new virus importations and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction.\n\nVaccination recommendations for travellers to polio-affected areas are published at:\n\n\nInternational travel and health",

        "Description of the Situation": "4 September 2014\n\n \nOn 2 September 2014, the National Health and Family Planning Commission of China notified WHO of 2 additional laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus.\n\nDetails of the cases are as follows:\n\nA 66-year-old woman from Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. She had onset of symptoms on 14 July 2014, was admitted to a hospital on 17 July 2014, and died on 3 August 2014. The patient had a history of exposure to live poultry.\nA 53-year-old male from Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. He had onset of symptoms on 5 August and was admitted to a hospital on 9 August. He is currently in a mild condition. The patient has a history of exposure to live poultry.\n\n\nThe Chinese Government has taken the following surveillance and control measures:\n\nStrengthen surveillance and situation analysis;\n\nReinforce case management and medical treatment;\nConduct risk communication with the public and release information. \n\n\nThe overall risk assessment has not changed.\n\nThe previous report of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus detection in live poultry exported from mainland China to Hong Kong SAR shows the potential for the virus to spread through movement of live poultry. At this time there is no indication that international spread of avian influenza A(H7N9) has occurred. However as the virus infection does not cause signs of disease in poultry, continued surveillance is needed. Further sporadic human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) infection are expected in affected and possibly neighbouring areas.\n\nShould human cases from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during or after arrival. If this were to occur, community level spread is considered unlikely as the virus does not have the ability to transmit easily among humans. There has been no evidence of sustained human to human transmission, therefore the risk of ongoing international spread of H7N9 virus by travellers is low.\n\nWHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid poultry farms, or contact with animals in live bird markets, or entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travellers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices. \n\nWHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.\n\nWHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, in order to ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005), and continue national health preparedness actions.",

        "Description of the Situation": "27 August 2014\n\n Epidemiology and surveillance \n\nOn 26 August 2014, the Ministry of Health, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) notified the World Health Organization (WHO) of an outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Equateur Province. \n\nThe index case was a pregnant woman from Ikanamongo Village who butchered a bush animal that had been killed and given to her by her husband. She became ill with symptoms of EVD and reported to a private clinic in Isaka Village. On 11 August 2014, she died of a then-unidentified haemorrhagic fever. Local customs and rituals associated with death meant that several health-care workers were exposed and presented with similar symptoms in the following week.\n\nBetween 28 July and 18 August 2014, a total of 24 suspected cases of haemorrhagic fever, including 13 deaths, have been identified. Human-to-human transmission has been established and includes the health-care personnel who were exposed to the deceased pregnant woman during surgery (one doctor and two nurses) in addition to the hygienist and a ward boy, all of whom developed symptoms and died. Other deaths have been recorded among the relatives who attended the index case, individuals who were in contact with the clinic staff, and those who handled the bodies of the deceased during funerals. The other 11 cases are currently being treated in isolation centres. \n\nSamples have been sent to laboratories in Kinshasa and in Gabon for confirmation of EVD and to identify the strain. The index case and the 80 contacts have no history of travel to the EVD-affected countries in West Africa (Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, or Sierra Leone) or history of contact with individuals from the affected areas. At this time, it is believed that the outbreak in DRC is unrelated to the ongoing outbreak in west Africa. \nHealth sector response\n\nThe Ministry of Health of DRC has dispatched field teams to the area to monitor and evaluate the situation. Contact tracing has begun and 80 individuals are currently being followed-up. Treatment of patients is ongoing and infection prevention and control measures are in place and are being supported by WHO with the delivery of personal protective equipment to the area.\n\nWHO is currently monitoring the situation with the Government of DRC and awaiting confirmation of the disease strain from the laboratories. A rapid response team is poised to deploy and assist DRC, if needed. This is the seventh outbreak of EVD in the former Zaire / present DRC since 1976.\n\nWHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied except in cases where individuals have been confirmed or are suspected of being infected with EVD or where individuals have had contact with cases of EVD.

Currently, some companies have taken the decision to suspend services to the affected countries. This includes airlines and shipping companies. As a result of these decisions, countries are beginning to experience supply shortages, including fuel, food, and basic supplies. WHO is working with the UN World Food Programme to ensure adequate food and supplies, but calls on companies to make business decisions based on scientific evidence with regard to the transmission of Ebola virus. \n\nIn the current outbreak, the majority of Ebola virus disease cases are a result of human-to-human transmission and failure to apply appropriate infection prevention and control measures in home care, some clinical settings, and in burial rituals. It is important to understand that EVD is not an airborne disease. Individuals may become infected as a result of contact with the bodily fluids (vomit, diarrhoea, sputum, blood, etc.) from persons who are confirmed to have EVD or who have died from EVD. Companies bringing goods and services to the affected countries are at low risk for exposure to EVD and WHO, under the International Health Regulations, encourages companies and organizations to continue providing these necessary supplies.\n\nCountries around the world continue to engage in active surveillance for cases of EVD. Reports have been received by WHO of suspected cases and systematic verification is underway in a number of countries to confirm whether these are actual EVD cases. Overall, these reports are a positive sign that surveillance is working and countries are stepping up their preparedness to respond. As of today, no cases have been confirmed outside Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, or Sierra Leone. \n\nA high-level delegation from WHO is currently in the affected countries, working with the national authorities and partners to adapt strategic operations response plans. Meetings are planned with leaders in Liberia and Sierra Leone, where transmission continues to be high. \n\nWHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied except in cases where individuals have been confirmed or are suspected of being infected with EVD or where individuals have had contact with cases of EVD.

To reduce the likelihood that those who are infected will carry the disease outside their communities, the governments have set up quarantine zones in areas of high transmission including severely-affected cities such as Gueckedou in Guinea, Kenema and Kailahun in Sierra Leone and Foya in Liberia. \n\nThis prevents people living in these areas from moving to other parts of the country and potentially increasing EVD transmission. However, it also means that barriers to travel limit their access to food and other necessities. While preventing further transmission of EVD is crucial, it is essential that people in those zones have access to food, water, good sanitation and other basic supplies.\n\nWHO is working with the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) to ensure people in the quarantine zones receive regular food aid and other non-medical supplies. WFP is now scaling up its programme to distribute food to the around 1 million people living in the quarantine zones in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. \n\nFood has been delivered to hospitalized patients and people under quarantine who are not able to leave their homes to purchase food. Providing regular food supplies is a potent means of limiting unnecessary movement.\n\nWHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied except in cases where individuals have been confirmed or are suspected of being infected with EVD or where individuals have had contact with cases of EVD.

To correct this misunderstanding, WHO called a press conference at the UN Palais des Nations in Geneva on 14 August. Dr Isabelle Nuttall, speaking on behalf of WHO, said, \u201cAir travel, even from Ebola-affected countries, is low-risk for Ebola transmission.\u201d\n\nDr Nuttall further clarified modes of transmission for Ebola and emphasized that the disease is not an airborne virus, unlike influenza or tuberculosis. The infection is transmitted to others through direct contact with the bodily fluids of a sick person, such as blood, vomit, sweat, and diarrhoea. Even if an individual infected with EVD travels by plane, the likelihood of other passengers and crew coming into contact with the individual\u2019s bodily fluids is very low. \n\nWHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied except in cases where individuals have been confirmed or are suspected of being infected with EVD or where individuals have had contact with cases of EVD.

If it is, what criteria and conditions need to be satisfied before they can be used?\n\nIf it is ethical to use these unregistered interventions in the current circumstances, then what criteria should guide the choice of an intervention and who should receive priority for treatment or prevention?\n\n\nThe findings of this panel will be posted on WHO\u2019s website on Tuesday, 12 August 2014.\nDisease update\n\nNew cases and deaths attributable to EVD continue to be reported by the Ministries of Health in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone.

Information about the nature of Ebola virus disease (EVD) was highlighted. This was followed by outlining the essential components for control, including the need for national leadership, improved care and case management, identifying transmission chains and stopping disease spread, and preventing further outbreaks. Among the critical issues are: cross-border infections and travelers; partners reaching the limits of their capacity and ability to respond rapidly, safely, and effectively; and concerns about the socio-economic impact of continued transmission.\n\nThe Director-General also shared information from her recent meetings in Guinea with Member States of the Mano River Union \u2013 C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. She outlined that the response in West Africa would focus on three areas: \n\nTreatment of Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou, Kenema, and Foya as a unified sector, which will include public health measures meant to reduce movement in and out of the area.\n\nIntensifying current measures in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone.\nTaking steps to reduce international spread to other countries in Africa and outside of the African Region.\n\n\nThe Sub-regional Ebola Operations Coordination Centre (SEOCC) in Conakry reported on 5 August that the following actions are underway in the four affected countries:\n\nIn Guinea, new foci have emerged and case management facilities will be needed. Exit screening is currently being tested in Conakry, in partnership with the US CDC. \nIn Liberia, security issues continue to be of concern, notwithstanding the commitment of the Government. Community resistance remains high.\nIn Nigeria, the Government is focused on following up the contacts from the index case. Clinical support is urgently needed and a treatment centre is being set up for managing cases of EVD.\nIn Sierra Leone, efforts are underway to map where treatment centres are most needed and getting those set up. A similar exercise is underway for laboratories. \n\n\nThe SEOCC is assisting countries with these and many other response measures.\n\nOn 6 August, WHO is convening an Emergency Committee of international experts to review the outbreak and advise the Director-General, in accordance with the International Health Regulations, whether the Ebola virus disease outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Experts will receive an epidemiological briefing and will determine whether the criteria for a PHEIC have been met. If the Emergency Committee agrees that this is a PHEIC, they will then advise the Director-General on temporary recommendations. A summary of the meeting will be made public and a press briefing will be held on Friday, 8 August.\nDisease update\n\nNew cases and deaths attributable to EVD continue to be reported by the Ministries of Health in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone. Between 2 and 4 August 2014, 108 new cases (laboratory-confirmed, probable, and suspect cases) of EVD and 45 deaths were reported from the four countries as follows: Guinea, 10 new cases and 5 deaths; Liberia, 48 new cases and 27 deaths; Nigeria, 5 new cases and 0 death; and Sierra Leone, 45 new cases and 13 deaths.\n\nAs of 4 August 2014, the cumulative number of cases attributed to EVD in the four countries stands at 1 711, including 932 deaths.

A Joint Declaration of Heads of State and Government of the Mano River Union (comprised of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone) was issued and leaders pledged to commit additional resources to the outbreak. This will include the following measures:\n\nActions at the inter-country level to focus on cross-border regions, including isolation of specific areas by police and military and material support to the citizens in these areas. Health-care centers in these zones will be strengthened for treatment, testing, and contact tracing. Burials will be done in accordance with national health regulations.\n\nProvision of incentives, treatment, and protection for health personnel so they can feel safe in their jobs and perform their duties. In addition, security for national and international personnel supporting the fight against Ebola will also be assured.\nA commitment by Heads of State to do their part to bring the outbreak to an end as soon as possible. To this end, the international community will support affected countries to build capacity for surveillance, contact tracing, case management, and laboratory capacity.\nMobilization of the private and public sectors to work in synergy and increase sensitization efforts to enable communities to understand EVD for effective and efficient eradication.\nInvolve all sectors in immediate implementation of necessary interventions outlined in national response plans; harmonize and coordinate these measures; deploy national and international human resources with appropriate skills; mobilize and allocate appropriate financial resources; strengthen surveillance of cross-border movement.\nImprove information and communications systems in an effort to strengthen sensitization and promote community participation, taking into account cultural contexts. \nImprove infection prevention and control measures in all treatment centres to prevent health personnel from contracting and dying from EVD.\nPut in place a monitoring and evaluation system of regional strategies and conduct research around the disease.\n\n\nHuman and financial resource mobilization continues to be sought from WHO\u2019s partners, UN agencies, and other stakeholders. On Friday, WHO and the affected countries issued the Ebola Virus Disease Outbreak Response Plan in West Africa covering Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, neighbouring states, and other countries in the region from July-December 2014. (http://who.int/csr/disease/ebola/outbreak-response-plan/en/).

The surge in the number of new EVD cases in Guinea after weeks of low viral activity demonstrates that undetected chains of transmission existed in the community. This phenomenon is retrogressive to the control of the EVD outbreak; and calls for stepping up outbreak containment measures, especially effective contact tracing.\n\nIn addition, the Ministry of Health of Nigeria has reported the first probable case of EVD. According to the Nigeria authorities, the case is a 40-year-old Liberian male national who recently travelled to Nigeria where he presented in hospital with symptoms of EVD. The patient travelled by air and arrived in Lagos, Nigeria, on 20th July via Lom\u00e9, Togo. He was symptomatic while traveling, was admitted to a private hospital immediately on arrival, and died on 25 July. On 22 July, a sample was taken and preliminary laboratory analysis was conducted in the virology laboratory of Lagos University Teaching Hospital and tested positive for Ebola virus. The sample from this case is being referred to the WHO Collaborating Centre at the Institut Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal, for confirmation. The national authority in Nigeria is working closely with WHO and partners to ensure that this incident case is contained at the source. \nHealth sector response\n\nIn an effort to accelerate the response to the current EVD outbreak in West Africa, the Director General of WHO held discussions with the donor community and development partners on 24 July 2014 in Geneva. Countries and agencies again pledged their assistance and support to the outbreak and efforts are underway to secure additional human and financial resources.\n\nThe Regional Director for the Africa Region, Dr Luis Sambo, continued his fact-finding mission in the three affected countries. After visiting Liberia earlier in the week (21 \u2013 22 July), he visited Sierra Leone (22 \u2013 23 July) and Guinea (23 \u2013 25 July). The goal of his visits was to assess first-hand the EVD outbreak, review the current response and challenges, and explore the best ways to rapidly contain the outbreak in West Africa. Official meetings with Presidents, Ministers of Health and other senior government officials, international and local NGOs, UN agencies, and other stakeholders were held.\n\nDuring the mission, the Regional Director underscored the seriousness of the outbreak while reiterating that it can be contained using known infection prevention and control measures. He observed that the outbreak is beyond each national health sector alone and urged the governments of the affected countries to mobilize and involve all sectors, including civil society and communities, in the response. He requested the respective governments to re-deploy adequate and appropriate national staff and other national resources to the field level and promote behavioural change while respecting cultural practices. He repeated the mandate to countries to enhance cross-border collaboration and strengthen effective coordination and the mandate of WHO to coordinate the response to public health emergencies. On behalf of WHO, the Regional Director pledged WHO\u2019s continued commitment to the affected countries and reaffirmed its role in engaging and mobilizing the international community in support of national efforts to control the EVD outbreak.\n\nOn 24 July 2014, the Prime Minister of Guinea and the Regional Director officially inaugurated the WHO Sub-regional Outbreak Coordination Centre (SEOCC) in Conakry. The Centre will consolidate and harmonize the technical support at local, country, regional, and international level. WHO has asked its partners to deploy representatives from their respective organizations to sit in the hub and contribute to the activities of the coordination centre. The establishment of the SEOCC was a follow-up action from the emergency Ministerial Meeting held in Accra, Ghana, earlier in the month.\n\nEfforts are currently ongoing to scale up and strengthen all aspects of the response in the three countries, including contact tracking, public information and community mobilization, case management and infection prevention and control, and coordination.\n\nWHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia, or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event.\nDisease update\n\nNew cases and deaths attributable to EVD continue to be reported by the Ministries of Health in the three West African countries of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Between 21 and 23 July 2014, 108 new cases of EVD, including 12 deaths, were reported from the three countries as follows: Guinea, 12 new cases and 5 deaths; Liberia, 25 new cases with 2 deaths; and Sierra Leone, 71 new cases and 5 death. These numbers include laboratory-confirmed, probable, and suspect cases and deaths of EVD.\n\nAs of 23 July 2014, the cumulative number of cases attributed to EVD in the three countries stands at 1 201, including 672 deaths.

The respective Ministries of Health continue to work with WHO and its partners to implement outbreak containment measures.\nHealth sector response\n\nThe Regional Director, WHO African Region, began official visits to the three West African countries of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone on 21 July 2014. On the first leg of his mission, the Regional Director visited Liberia from 21 - 22 July 2014. The goal of the visit is to make a first-hand assessment of the EVD outbreak, review the current outbreak response and challenges, and explore the best ways to rapidly contain the EVD outbreak in West Africa. The Regional Director held official meetings with the President of Liberia and the Minister of Health, including senior government officials. The President and the Regional Director also participated in the Ebola national coordination meeting at the Ministry of Health. During this meeting, the Regional Director emphasized the need to step up implementation of key outbreak containment strategies, including community engagement and involvement, effective contact tracing, cross-border collaboration and effective coordination. Discussions were also held with international and local non-governmental organizations, UN agencies, and other stakeholders to enhance collaboration and effective coordination. The Regional Director called upon all partners to be fully involved in the EVD outbreak response. Following his visit to Liberia, significant financial contributions and commitments were made, including from the Government and partners. \n\nIn Liberia, the Minister of Health launched the national strategic plan for accelerated response to the EVD outbreak. The plan is aligned to the inter-country strategy for accelerated response to the outbreak, adopted in the Accra Ministerial meeting. It is expected that the launch and subsequent implementation of this strategic plan will bring tangible improvement and scale up effective outbreak containment measures at field level. Similarly, the Ministry of Health and partners in Guinea and Sierra Leone are conducting planning meetings to re-strategize and come up with concrete, action-oriented national operational plans to accelerate the response to the EVD outbreak response.\n\nEfforts are currently ongoing to scale up and strengthen all aspects of the outbreak response in the three countries, including contact tracing, public information and community mobilization, case management and infection prevention and control, and coordination. \n\nWHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia, or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event.\nDisease update\n\nNew cases and deaths attributable to EVD continue to be reported by the Ministries of Health in the three West African countries of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.

        "Description of the Situation": "23 July 2014\n\n \nOn 12 July 2014, the National IHR Focal Point of the Islamic Republic of\nIran reported to WHO an additional laboratory-confirmed case of infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).\n\n\nThe patient is a 67-year-old woman from Kerman Province. The patient had Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and was admitted to a hospital on 6 June 2014 due to a COPD exacerbation. The patient was discharged on 14 June 2014 and continued treatment at home. She was in a stable condition until she developed severe acute respiratory symptoms and was readmitted to a hospital on 25 June 2014. The patient was laboratory-confirmed with MERS-CoV on 5 July 2014 and died on the same day. The patient had no history of travel and no known history of contact with animals or consumption of raw camel milk products in the 14 days prior to becoming ill. The patient did not have known contact with a previously reported MERS-CoV case. However, during her first hospitalisation, the patient had close contact with another patient with severe acute respiratory infection.\n\nInvestigation of contacts in the health care facility and family of the case is ongoing. \n\nAdditionally, Saudi Arabia reported 3 deaths among previously reported MERS-CoV cases.\n\nGlobally, 837 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV including at least 291 related deaths have officially been reported to WHO.\nWHO advice\n\nBased on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.\n\nInfection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.\n\nUntil more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS\u2010CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.\n\nFood hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.\n\nWHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.",

        "Description of the Situation": "19 July 2014\n\n Epidemiology and surveillance \n\nWHO continues to monitor the evolution of the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea. The current epidemic trend of EVD outbreak in Sierra Leone and Liberia remains serious, with 67 new cases and 19 deaths reported from 15 \u2013 17 July 2014. These include suspect, probable, and laboratory-confirmed cases. The EVD outbreak in Guinea continues to show a declining trend, with no new cases reported during this period. Critical analyses and review of the current outbreak response is being undertaken to inform the process of developing prioritized national operational plans. Effective implementation of the prioritized plans will be vital in reversing the current trend of EVD outbreak, especially in Liberia and Sierra Leone.\nHealth sector response\n\nWHO has been working with national authorities and partners in the affected countries to analyse and review the current outbreak response. An assessment of the outbreak response conducted in Liberia identified several gaps and challenges. Some of the gaps identified include low coverage of contact tracing; persisting denial and resistance in the community; weak data management; inadequate infection prevention and control practices, especially in peripheral health facilities; and weak leadership and coordination at sub-national levels. Underpinning these challenges were limited financial resources and human technical capacity. Comprehensive mapping of the financial, logistics, and human resource needs will be articulated in the national operational plan under development. This exercise of developing prioritized operational plans is also being conducted in Guinea and Sierra Leone.\n\nFollowing the call for regional collaboration during the Accra Ministerial meeting, the Government and the Ministry of Health of Gambia provided a team of 11 health-care workers to support outbreak response in Sierra Leone. While this team will contribute the critical human resource needs, the mission will be crucial for enhancing capacity for epidemic preparedness and response in The Gambia. This mission is being supported by UNDP, Gambia, and WHO Sierra Leone.\n\nEfforts are currently ongoing to scale up and strengthen all aspects of the outbreak response in the three countries, including contact tracing, public information and community mobilization, case management and infection prevention and control, and coordination.\n\nWHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia, or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event.\nDisease update\n\nNew cases and deaths attributable to EVD continue to be reported by the Ministries of Health in the three West African countries of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.

Genetic sequencing indicated that the cases are linked to the ongoing outbreak in Cameroon. \n\nA national emergency action plan to respond to the polio outbreak was developed by the Ministry of Health and polio partner agencies and is being implemented. Three nationwide campaigns with bivalent oral polio vaccine (bOPV) have already been conducted in the country - two campaigns targeting children under 15 years old in April 2014 and early May 2014, and one in late May 2014 targeting children under 5 years old. Two nationwide bOPV campaigns are planned for mid-July 2014 and mid-August 2014; the July 2014 round will target the entire population, and the August 2014 round will target children under 15 years old. \n\nAs noted in the Disease Outbreak News update published on 25 June 2014, Brazil reported on 18 June 2014 that WPV1 had been detected in a sewage sample collected in March 2014 at Viracopos International Airport in Sao Paulo state, with genetic sequencing indicating that this virus is most closely related to the virus currently circulating in Equatorial Guinea. No further samples have tested positive to date in Brazil, nor have any paralytic polio cases been detected there.\n\nAccording to the International Health Regulations (IHR) Temporary Recommendations issued by the Director-General of WHO on 5 May 2014, Equatorial Guinea is considered as a polio exporting country. \n\nThe country is therefore working to ensure that all residents and long-term visitors (of more than 4 weeks) who travel internationally receive a supplementary dose of polio vaccine between 4 weeks and 12 months prior to departure.",

New cases and deaths attributed to EVD continue to be reported from the three countries. Between 13 \u2013 14 July 2014, 18 new cases and 11 deaths were reported from Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. These include suspect, probable, and laboratory-confirmed cases. The occurrence of community deaths, still being reported in Guinea, remains a serious concern. The respective Ministries of Health are working with WHO and its partners to step up outbreak containment measures.\nHealth sector response\n\nThe national authorities in the three affected countries are scaling up outbreak containment measures. In Sierra Leone, the Ministry of Health has established an Emergency Operation Centre (EOC) aimed at ensuring effective coordination and accelerating implementation of the EVD outbreak response. The EOC is chaired by the Minister of Health and co-chaired by the WHO Representative for Sierra Leone, with members including heads of the different sub-committees of the task force, other senior staff, and key partners. The EOC will oversee the development of the prioritized operational plan in line with the Accra inter-country strategy, ensure that priority interventions are implemented as planned, and streamline communication and information flow. \n\nIn Guinea, a high level political delegation comprised of the President of the National Assembly, the Ministers of Health and Communication, and senior government officials conducted a 3-day field visit to Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou, from 14 \u2013 17 July 2014. Outbreak response teams in Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou, where community deaths continue to be reported, encountered resistance and apprehension from the communities. The delegation engaged local and opinion leaders in order to build a relationship of trust with the community, which should foster cooperation and enhance acceptance of outbreak control measures. As a result of this engagement and dialogue, leaders of 19 out of 23 villages pledged their commitment to embrace the EVD outbreak response. Meanwhile, leaders of the four villages that did not turn up for the meeting later made contacts with the local administrative authority, expressing their willingness to be part of the response. In addition, the national authority has established administrative and law enforcement mechanisms to deal with extreme instances of resistance, such as violence towards the response teams.\n\nIn Liberia, the Chief Medical Officer including senior officials of the Ministry of Health, WHO, and other partners visited Foya district, the epicentre of the EVD outbreak in Liberia. The field visit aimed to streamline and strengthen implementation of outbreak containment measures. The delegation participated in the district task force meeting and held discussions with the district authority, partners and health care workers.\n\nMeanwhile, efforts are ongoing to scale up and strengthen all aspects of the outbreak response in the three countries, including contact tracing, public information and community mobilization, case management and infection prevention and control, and so on.\n\nWHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia, or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event.\nDisease update\n\nNew cases and deaths attributable to EVD continue to be reported by the Ministries of Health in the three West African countries of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.

        "Description of the Situation": "15 July 2014\n\n Epidemiology and surveillance \n\nWHO continues to closely monitor the evolving Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. The current epidemic trend in Sierra Leone and Liberia remains serious, with high numbers of new cases and deaths being reported. Between 8 \u2013 12 July 2014, 79 new cases, and 65 deaths were reported from Liberia and Sierra. In Liberia, 30 new cases and 13 deaths were reported, while in Sierra Leone, 49 new cases and 52 deaths have been reported. These include suspect, probable and laboratory confirmed cases. This trend indicates that a high level of transmission of the Ebola Virus continues to take place in the community. The epidemic situation in Guinea is being closely observed, with 6 new cases and 3 deaths reported between 8 \u2013 12 July 2014. The respective Ministries of Health are working with WHO and partners to step up outbreak containment measures.\nHealth sector response\n\nAs a follow up action to the Emergency Ministerial meeting in Accra, the Regional Director, WHO African Region has taken a decision to re-deploy senior, technical, and support staff to the sub-regional coordination centre that is being established in Conakry, Guinea. The personnel re-assigned include a Director, Regional Advisors, epidemiologists, communication experts, social mobilization specialists, data managers, administrative officers, and other support staff. Preparation to establish the coordination centre is being finalized, with operations of the centre scheduled to be activated on 15 July 2014. The centre will act as a control and coordination platform, consolidating and harmonizing the technical support to the West African countries including assisting in resource mobilization. \n\nThe three affected countries, with support from WHO, have initiated the process of reviewing and updating the current EVD national response plans. This exercise will lead to the development of prioritized national operational plans, aligned to the inter-country strategy adopted by the Ministers of Health in Accra. The operational plan will clearly highlight priority interventions and map out the required resources (human, financial, and logistics) for effective implementation of the outbreak containment measures. In addition, these documents will be vital for mobilization of the additional resources.\n\nWHO is currently supporting the affected countries to strengthen contact tracing, as one of the most effective outbreak containment measures. Early detection and prompt isolation of new EVD cases is requisite for interrupting secondary transmission of Ebola virus in the community. Therefore, WHO supported the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MoHSW) of Liberia to identify and train 107 community volunteers and 33 supervisors. In Sierra Leone, a total of 296 community volunteers have been trained. The trained volunteers have been deployed in the affected communities to conduct contact tracing and ensure immediate evacuation of suspected EVD cases from the community. In response to a request from MOHSW Liberia, WHO, with support from the Government of the United States of America, has supplied personal protective equipment (PPE) for and other medical supplies to Liberia in order to ensure the safety of health-care workers in their response efforts. This donation, was handed over to MOHSW Liberia on 26 June and 3 July, included PPE appropriate for use by both clinical care and burial teams. On 14 July, additional supplies, including backpack sprayers and hand sprayers for disinfection as well disposal bags for biohazard wastes, were delivered to the country.\n\nWHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia, or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event.\nDisease update\n\nNew cases and deaths attributable to EVD continue to be reported by the Ministries of Health in the three West African countries of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Between 8 \u2013 12 July, 2014, 85 new cases of EVD, including 68 new deaths, were reported from the three countries as follows: Guinea, 6 new cases and 3 deaths; Liberia, 30 new cases with 13 deaths; and Sierra Leone 49 new cases and 52 deaths. These numbers include laboratory-confirmed, probable, and suspect cases and deaths of EVD.\n\nAs of 12 July 2014, the cumulative number of cases attributed to EVD in the three countries stands at 964, including 603 deaths. The distribution and classification of the cases are as follows: Guinea, 406 cases (297 confirmed, 92 probable, and 17 suspected) and 304 deaths (198 confirmed, 92 probable, and 14 suspected); Liberia, 172 cases (70 confirmed, 41 probable, and 61 suspected) and 105 deaths (48 confirmed, 33 probable, and 24 suspected); and Sierra Leone, 386 cases (339 confirmed, 37 probable, and 10 suspected) and 194 deaths (151 confirmed, 38 probable, and 5 suspected). \nConfirmed, probable, and suspect cases and deaths from Ebola virus disease in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, as of 12 July 2014\n\n\n\n\n\nNew (1)\nConfirmed\nProbable\nSuspect\nTotals\nby country\n\n\n \n\n\nGuinea\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCases\n6\n297\n92\n17\n406\n\n\nDeaths\n3\n198\n92\n14\n304\n\n\nLiberia \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCases\n30\n70\n41\n61\n172\n\n\nDeaths\n13\n48\n33\n24\n105\n\n\nSierra Leone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCases\n49\n339\n37\n10\n386\n\n\nDeaths\n52\n151\n38\n5\n194\n\n\nTotals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCases\n85\n706\n170\n88\n964\n\n\nDeaths\n68\n397\n163\n43\n603\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1) New cases were reported between 8 and 12 July 2014.\n\n\n\n\nThe total number of cases is subject to change due to reclassification, retrospective investigation, consolidation of cases and laboratory data, and enhanced surveillance.

        "Description of the Situation": "8 July 2014\n\n Epidemiology and surveillance \n\nWHO continues to monitor the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. The current epidemic trend shows a mixed picture, as follows: \n\nLiberia reported 16 new EVD cases and Sierra Leone, 34 new cases \u2013 since 3 July. These numbers indicate that active viral transmission continues in the community.\nThere has been a reduction in the number of new EVD cases reported in Guinea, with no new cases during the last 7 days. \n\n\nWHO continues to encourage and support outbreak containment measures in the three countries. \nHealth sector response\n\nHealth Ministers and technical staff from 11 countries, representatives from WHO, and key international partner organizations met in an Emergency Ministerial meeting in Accra, Ghana July 2 and 3 to address the ongoing Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa. After hearing technical updates and sharing country and field experiences, they agreed on a strategy for an accelerated operational response to control the outbreak with priority actions to address the serious threat to countries in West Africa.\n\nIn agreeing to priorities and actions, it was acknowledged that a number of gaps and challenges remain. To address these, the World Health Organization (WHO) will establish a Sub-Regional Centre in Guinea to act as a coordinating platform to consolidate and harmonize the technical support to West African countries by all major partners and to assist in resource mobilization. Delegates to the meeting also emphasized the importance of WHO leading an international effort to promote research on EVD and other haemorrhagic fevers.\n\nAmong the key priorities at this time are:\n\nmobilization of community, religious, and political leaders to improve awareness about and understanding of EVD;\nstrengthening surveillance, case finding, and contact tracing; \ndeploying additional human resources with relevant qualifications to key hot spots;\nidentifying and committing additional domestic financial resources; \norganizing cross-border consultations to facilitate an ongoing exchange of information; and \nworking together and sharing experiences with countries that have previously managed EVD outbreaks in the spirit of south-south cooperation.\n\n\nIn addition, national intersectoral meetings involving key government ministries, national technical committees, and other stakeholders will be held to map out a plan for immediate implementation of a sub-regional response strategy. It has also been recommended that issues related specifically to the EVD outbreak be addressed at an upcoming summit of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Heads of States. \n\nWHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia, or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event.\nDisease update\n\nNew cases and deaths attributable to Ebola virus disease (EVD) continue to be reported by the Ministries of Health in the three West African countries of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Between 3 and 6 July 2014, 50 new cases of EVD, including 25 deaths, were reported from the three countries as follows: Guinea, 0 new cases and 2 deaths; Liberia, 16 new cases with 9 deaths; and Sierra Leone 34 new cases and 14 deaths. These numbers include laboratory-confirmed, probable, and suspect cases and deaths of EVD.\n\nAs of 6 July 2014, the cumulative number of cases attributed to EVD in the three countries stands at 844, including 518 deaths. The distribution and classification of the cases are as follows: Guinea, 408 cases (294 confirmed, 96 probable, and 18 suspected) and 307 deaths (195 confirmed, 96 probable, and 16 suspected); Liberia, 131 cases (63 confirmed, 30 probable, and 38 suspected) and 84 deaths (41 confirmed, 28 probable, and 15 suspected); and Sierra Leone, 305 cases (269 confirmed, 34 probable, and 2 suspected) and 127 deaths (114 confirmed, 11 probable, and 2 suspected). \nConfirmed, probable, and suspect cases and deaths from Ebola virus disease in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, as of 6 July 2014\n\n\n\n\n\nNew (1)\nConfirmed\nProbable\nSuspect\nTotals by country\n\n\n \n\n\nGuinea\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCases\n0\n294\n96\n18\n408\n\n\nDeaths\n2\n195\n96\n16\n307\n\n\nLiberia \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCases\n16\n63\n30\n38\n131\n\n\nDeaths\n9\n41\n28\n15\n84\n\n\nSierra Leone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCases\n34\n269\n34\n2\n305\n\n\nDeaths\n14\n114\n11\n2\n127\n\n\nTotals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCases\n50\n626\n160\n58\n844\n\n\nDeaths\n25\n350\n135\n33\n518\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1) New cases were reported between 3 and 6 July 2014.\n\n\n\n\nThe total number of cases is subject to change due to reclassification, retrospective investigation, consolidation of cases and laboratory data, and enhanced surveillance.

        "Description of the Situation": "3 July 2014\n\n Epidemiology and surveillance \n\nThe evolution of the Ebola virus disease outbreak in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia remains a serious concern as primary and secondary viral transmissions continue to occur in both urban and rural communities. Analyses of the current trend and the potential risk factors for the continuing spread of this epidemic have been conducted. The major factors responsible for continuous propagation of EVD outbreak in the sub-region include:\n\n1. Some negative cultural practices and traditional beliefs, resulting into mistrust, apprehension and resistance to adopt recommended public health preventive measures. The implication of this include poor health care seeking behaviour such as hiding of EVD patients, home-based management of EVD patients, and customary treatment of dead bodies. These are very high risk practices leading to extensive exposures to Ebola virus in the community. Consequently, community deaths continue to be reported. In addition, the potential contacts to the EVD patients managed at home and exposures during customary burial procedures are not systematically identified and put under observation (very critical measures for containment of community transmission of Ebola virus). This is therefore a major factor amplifying the outbreak.\n\n2. The extensive movement of people within and across borders has facilitated rapid spread of the infection across and within the three countries. The homogeneous community living along the border areas have common socio-cultural activities that enhance viral transmission e.g. visiting sick relatives or attending to burial ceremonies of relatives across the border. In addition, the cross border movement has complicated tracking and follow up of contacts, with several contacts loss to follow up. \n\n3. Currently, the coverage of effective outbreak containment measures is not comprehensive. The unprecedented geographical expanse of the EVD outbreak in the three countries requires enormous and robust response capacity and structures in terms of human capital, financial, operational and logistics requirements. This is the first major EVD outbreak in West Africa and the affected countries had weak capacity and structures for epidemic preparedness and response, particularly for viral haemorrhagic fever. Lastly, the apprehension of some communities limits access to affected population with effective outbreak control measures.\n Health sector response\n\nIn an effort to rapidly interrupt further spread of the Ebola virus, the World Health Organization convened a special Ministerial meeting on Ebola virus disease outbreak in West Africa. The meeting, held on 2-3 July 2014 in Accra, Ghana, brings together Ministers of Health and senior health officials from 11 African countries (C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Uganda), as well as partners, Ebola survivors, representatives of airlines and mining companies, and the donor communities. The objective of the meeting was to obtain consensus from Member States and partners on the optimal ways to interrupt the ongoing Ebola virus transmission in West Africa in order to reduce the human, social and economic impact of the current and future EVD outbreaks. The meeting focused on getting a clear understanding of current situation and response, including gaps and challenges; developing a comprehensive operational response plan for controlling the outbreak; priority preparedness activities to be implemented by countries at risk; and engagement of national authorities to optimally respond to EVD outbreak.\n\nWHO, technical partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), UN agencies and donors continue to provide the necessary technical support to the Ministries of Health to stop the transmission of the EVD in the communities and health facilities. \n\nThe support is provided in the form of deployment of additional experts; provision of field logistics; and provision of equipment which include the establishment of field laboratories, personal protective equipment and medical supplies.\n\nWHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia, or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event.\nSummary statistics\n\nNew cases and deaths attributable to Ebola virus disease (EVD) continue to be reported by the Ministries of Health in the three West African countries of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Between 1and 2 July 2014, 21 new cases of EVD, including 14 deaths, were reported from the three countries, as follows: Guinea, 0 new case and 2 deaths; Liberia, 8 new cases with 10 deaths; and Sierra Leone 13 new cases and 2 deaths. These numbers include laboratory-confirmed, probable, and suspect cases and deaths of EVD.\n\nAs of 2 July 2014, the cumulative number of cases attributed to EVD in the three countries stands at 779, including 481 deaths. The distribution and classification of the cases are as follows: Guinea, 412 cases (292 confirmed, 100 probable, and 20 suspected) and 305 deaths (194 confirmed, 94 probable, and 17 suspected); Liberia, 115 cases (54 confirmed, 24 probable, and 37 suspected) and 75 deaths (38 confirmed, 22 probable, and 15 suspected); and Sierra Leone, 252 cases (211 confirmed, 35 probable, and 6 suspected) and 101 deaths (67 confirmed, 29 probable, and 5 suspected).

        "Description of the Situation": "25 June 2014\n\n \nOn 17 March 2014, WHO elevated the risk assessment of international spread of polio from central Africa, particularly Cameroon, to very high. A new exportation event from Equatorial Guinea demonstrates that the risk of international spread from central Africa remains very high (http://www.who.int/csr/don/2014_03_17_polio/en/). On 18 June 2014, Brazil reported that wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) had been detected in a sewage sample collected in March 2014 at Viracopos International Airport in Sao Paolo state. Genetic sequencing indicates that this virus is most closely related to the virus that is circulating in Equatorial Guinea. \n\nFour wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases have been reported in Equatorial Guinea in 2014. The index case \u2013 Equatorial Guinea\u2019s first case to be reported since 1999 \u2013 had onset of paralysis on 28 January 2014; the country\u2019s most recent case occurred on 3 April 2014. Genetic sequencing indicates these cases are linked to an ongoing WPV1 outbreak in Cameroon (Cameroon\u2019s most recent case was on 31 January 2014). Equatorial Guinea is implementing outbreak response activities, with three National Immunization Days (NIDs) with bivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV) in April and May, and plans for further NIDs in July and August. NIDs are deemed essential to stop the outbreak as an estimated 40% of children are fully immunized against polio through the routine immunization programme in the country.\n\nNo one in Brazil has been paralyzed by the virus nor is there evidence of transmission within the population of that country. This importation event in Brazil demonstrates that all regions of the world continue to be at risk of exposure to wild poliovirus until polio eradication is completed globally. It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for polioviruses (especially through the detection and investigation of Acute Flaccid Paralysis or AFP cases) in order to rapidly detect any new virus importations and to facilitate a rapid response. Uniformly high routine immunization coverage should be maintained at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction.\n\nAn analysis of immunity levels across central Africa found important immunity gaps in most countries in 2014, prompting the large-scale polio immunization campaigns that are ongoing in the area. In Gabon, a nationwide immunization campaign was held in June (with a further round planned for July), and in the Republic of Congo, a nationwide activity was conducted in May (another round is planned for June). Polio vaccination campaigns have been conducted where possible in the Central African Republic (May to June), with another round planned for accessible areas in July.\nWHO note\n\nThere is no evidence to date that Brazil was re-infected by the poliovirus of Equatorial Guinea origin that was detected in a sewage sample collected in Sao Paolo State in March 2014; to date there has been no evidence of transmission of the virus in Brazil following this exposure.\n\nGiven Brazil\u2019s high levels of population immunity, reflected in the high routine immunization coverage (>95%) and periodic vaccination campaigns, the lack of evidence so far of WPV1 transmission and the response being implemented, WHO assesses the risk of spread of this virus within or from Brazil as low.\nWHO travel recommendations\n\nWHO\u2019s International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to and from polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio.",

So far 73% (3098 contacts completed the follow-up period out of 4245 contacts registered since the beginning of the outbreak) have completed the mandatory 21-day observation period.\nSierra Leone\n\nThe word case refers to an aggregate of suspected, probable and confirmed. Between 18 and 20 June 2014, there were no new cases in Sierra Leone, but 4 new deaths were reported from Kailahun (0 cases and 3 deaths) and Kenema (0 new cases and 1 death). This brings the cumulative number of cases and deaths reported from Sierra Leone to 158 (147 confirmed, 8 probable, and 3 suspected) and 34 deaths from confirmed cases (*). \n\nThe geographical distribution of these cases and deaths is as follows: Kailahun, 135 cases and 32 deaths; Kambia, 1 case and 0 deaths; Port Loko, 2 cases and 0 deaths; Kenema, 19 cases and 2 deaths; and Western, 1 case and 0 deaths.

This includes a high-level advocacy meeting with the governments of the three affected countries to enhance coordination, information management, and communication, among others. The WHO Regional Director, in consultation with the Director General, has established a temporary function of WHO sub-regional EVD outbreak response Coordinator to directly support the affected countries. The Coordinator is based in Conakry, Guinea. In addition, WHO is organizing a high-level meeting for the Ministers of Health in the sub-region, technical experts and key stakeholders to be held from 2\u20133 July 2014 in Accra, Ghana. The objective is to ensure increased political commitment and enhanced cross-border collaboration for EVD response activities among the countries in the sub-region. WHO, GOARN, and other partners are also closely supporting the Ministries of Health in deploying additional experts in the various specialities (epidemiology, social mobilization, case management, data management, and logistics, among others) to support the EVD outbreak response efforts. The next cross-border technical meeting among the three countries is planned for 23 June 2014 in Kailahun, Sierra Leone. \n\nWHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia, or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event.\n\n\nThis update has also been posted on the regional website of the WHO African Regional Office \n\n\n\nCORRIGENDUM\n\n* In a Disease Outbreak News for Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa, dated 22 June 2014 (http://who.int/csr/don/2014_06_22_ebola/en/), WHO reported 58 deaths from EVD based on best available information from Sierra Leone. The cumulative suspected, probable, and confirmed (including 3 new confirmed Ebola deaths) was 55 not 58. The new confirmed deaths were double counted. On 24 June 2014, WHO reported 34 deaths from EVD based on best available information from Sierra Leone. (http://who.int/csr/don/2014_06_24_ebola/en/) This discrepancy in numbers is a result of a change in the reporting methodology on the part of Sierra Leone. The new method did not include probable or suspect deaths and were only deaths of laboratory-confirmed cases. The reported cases in Kono and Western Area were suspect cases which have now proved negative. As of 24 June, there are no confirmed cases of Ebola in Kono and Western Area.\n\n\nGoing forward, in an effort to ensure clear information, a table will be presented in future Ebola reports in the Disease Outbreak News.",

        "Description of the Situation": "24 June 2014\n\n \nOn 23 June 2014, the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) of China notified WHO of one additional laboratory-confirmed case of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus.\n\nThe patient is a 51-year-old male from Taizhou City, Zhejiang Province. He had onset of symptoms on 2 June, was admitted to hospital on 6 June, and is currently in a severe condition. The patient has a history of exposure to live poultry.\n\nThe Chinese Government has taken the following surveillance and control measures:\n\n\nStrengthen surveillance and situation analysis;\n\nReinforce case management and medical treatment;\nConduct risk communication with the public and release information.\n\n\nThe overall risk assessment has not changed.\n\nThe previous report of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus detection in live poultry exported from mainland China to Hong Kong SAR shows the potential for the virus to spread through movement of live poultry. At this time there is no indication that international spread of avian influenza A(H7N9) has occurred. However as the virus infection does not cause signs of disease in poultry, continued surveillance is needed. Further sporadic human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) infection are expected in affected and possibly neighbouring areas.\n\nShould human cases from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during or after arrival. If this were to occur, community level spread is considered unlikely as the virus does not have the ability to transmit easily among humans. There has been no evidence of sustained human to human transmission, therefore the risk of ongoing international spread of H7N9 virus by travellers is low.\n\nWHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid poultry farms, or contact with animals in live bird markets, or entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water (http://www.who.int/ith/updates/20140123/en/index.html ). Travellers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices (http://www.who.int/foodsafety/fs_management/live_markets/en/index.html).\n\nWHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.\n\nWHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, in order to ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005), and continue national health preparedness actions.",

        "Description of the Situation": "23 June 2014\n\n \nOn 18 June 2014, the National IHR Focal Point for Brazil reported the isolation of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) from sewage samples collected in March 2014 at Viracopos International Airport, in Campinas municipality in the State of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. Virus has been detected in the sewage only; sewage samples collected from the same site subsequent to the detection of WPV1 have been either negative or only positive for Sabin strains or non-polio enteroviruses; to date no case of paralytic polio has been reported. The isolate was detected through routine environmental surveillance testing of sewage water; there is no evidence of transmission of WPV1.\n\nGenetic sequencing indicated a close match with a strain of WPV1 that was recently isolated from a case of polio in Equatorial Guinea. Additional epidemiological investigation is ongoing.\n\nThe Americas Region has been free of indigenous WPV transmission since 1991 and Brazil since 1989. There is no indigenous transmission of wild poliovirus reported in Brazil since 1989.\n\nBrazil health authorities have enhanced their surveillance activity aimed to detect transmission of WPV1 and potential cases of paralytic polio as well as for any un-immunized persons. The vaccination coverage against polio in S\u00e3o Paulo State and Campinas municipality have been higher than 95% in the routine immunization program. The last national OPV campaign was conducted in June 2013. The campaign for this year is planned in November 2014 at the national level and the target group is children 6 months to less than 5 years of age with OPV.\n\nSpecimens collected through environmental surveillance at this and other sites in Brazil since 1994 have consistently tested negative for the presence of WPV.\n\nGiven the high levels of population immunity indicated by the high routine immunization coverage and implementation of periodic vaccination campaigns in the area \u2014 no evidence so far of WPV1 transmission and the response being implemented \u2014 the World Health Organization (WHO) assesses the risk of further international spread of this virus from Brazil as very low. \n\nGiven the ongoing WPV1 outbreak in Equatorial Guinea, low national routine immunization coverage, and the inconsistent quality of the initial outbreak response vaccination campaigns, WHO assesses the risk of additional exportation from Equatorial Guinea as high.\nWHO note\n\nBrazil was not re-infected with WPV; the country was exposed to a poliovirus importation.\n\nThe environmental surveillance system had the capacity to detect the poliovirus in sewage samples and the high immunity appears to have prevented transmission.\nWHO travel recommendations\n\nWHO\u2019s International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to and from polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Brazil has detected a poliovirus importation event. Based on current evidence, the country is not considered polio-affected.",

There has been no evidence of sustained human to human transmission, therefore the risk of ongoing international spread of H7N9 virus by travellers is low.\n\nWHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid poultry farms, or contact with animals in live bird markets, or entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water (http://www.who.int/ith/updates/20140123/en/index.html ). Travellers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices (http://www.who.int/foodsafety/fs_management/live_markets/en/index.html).\n\nWHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.\n\nWHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, in order to ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005), and continue national health preparedness actions.",

The patient works as a truck driver. He became ill on 4 June 2014, was diagnosed with mild pneumonia and was admitted to a hospital on 9 June 2014. The patient is currently in a stable condition. He has underlying medical conditions. He was tested positive to MERS-CoV on 11 June 2014. The patient frequently commutes to Qunfudah city, Qunfudah Region and Wadi Addawaser city, Riyadh Region. The patient has no other travel history. He is reported to have possible contacts with animals as he delivers hay to a mixed animal market. He has no contact with a known laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV case.\nA 33-year-old man, resident of Qunfudah city, Qunfudah Region. He works as a national security guard. The patient is asymptomatic, and was detected through the screening of contacts of previously laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases (reported between 11 April \u2013 9 June 2014). He has no underlying medical condition. He was tested positive to MERS-CoV on 13 June 2014. The patient has a history of frequent travel to Jeddah. He has no history of contact with animals.\n\nInvestigation of contacts of the patients and follow up is ongoing. \nAdditionally, Saudi Arabia has reported an additional 38 deaths among the laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases reported between 11 April \u2013 9 June 2014.\n \n\nGlobally, 701 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 249 related deaths have officially been reported to WHO.\nWHO advice\n\nBased on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.\n\nInfection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.\n\nUntil more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS\u2010CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to. \n\nFood hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.\n\nWHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.",

The patient had no contact with a previously laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV case. He had no history of travel. The patient is currently isolated and is in a stable condition. \n\nInvestigations and follow up of contacts of the patient have been carried out and no other case was detected. \nDetails of the case reported by the Islamic Republic of Iran on 4 June 2014 are as follows:\n\nThe patient is a 35 year-old nurse assistant. She developed a mild illness on 26 May 2014 followed by a productive cough on 28 May 2014. Her throat swab taken on 26 May 2014 was tested positive for MERS-CoV. \n\nShe has been advised to stay home and follow infection control precautions. The patient is a close contact to the first laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV case in the country reported to WHO on 26 May 2014. The patient did not have an underlying medical condition. She had no history of contact with animals and no history of consumption of raw camel products in the 14 days prior to becoming ill. She became asymptomatic on 3 June 2014 and her condition is currently stable. \n\nInvestigations into her contacts among health care workers and family members is on-going.\n\nGlobally, 697 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV including at least 210 related deaths have officially been reported to WHO.

Six experts and over 5000 PPEs have been deployed to Sierra Leone to support the response operations.\n\nWHO also supported Sierra Leone in developing proposals which were submitted to CERF (US$ 238\u00a0000) and OCHA Emergency Fund (about US$ 50\u00a0000) and DFID (\u00a3200\u00a0000). A joint WHO/HQ and AFRO mission provided support to Guinea on reviewing the outbreak response operations. The total estimated budget for Sierra Leone's EVD outbreak response is about US$ 1.8 million. On 3 June 2014, WHO facilitated a cross-border collaboration meeting between Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. They agreed to reinforce cross-border surveillance and harmonize social mobilization communication tools to address community resistance. \n\nWHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia, or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event.\n\n\nThis update has also been posted on the regional website of the WHO African Regional Office",

Airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.\n\nPatients should be managed as potentially infected when the clinical and epidemiological clues strongly suggest MERS-CoV, even if an initial test on a nasopharyngeal swab is negative. Repeat testing should be done when the initial testing is negative, preferably on specimens from the lower respiratory tract.\n\nHealth-care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations. All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.\n\nPeople at high risk of severe disease due to MERS-CoV should avoid close contact with animals when visiting farms or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. For the general public, when visiting a farm or a barn, general hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals, avoiding contact with sick animals, and following food hygiene practices, should be adhered to.\n\nWHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.",

Since the last update of Disease Outbreak News of 28 May 2014, 10 new cases and 7 new deaths have been reported. The current evolving epidemiological situation could be partly explained by persistent community resistance in some communities in Gueckedou, Macenta, and Conakry.\n\nAs of 18:00 on 28 May 2014, a cumulative total of 291 clinical cases of EVD, including 193 deaths have been reported. The classification of these cases and deaths are as follows: confirmed, 172 cases and 108 deaths; probable, 71 cases and 62 deaths; and suspected, 48 cases and 23 deaths. The breakdown of cases and deaths by affected areas is as follows: Conakry, 53 cases and 27 deaths; Gueckedou, 179 cases and 133 deaths; Macenta, 40 cases and 23 deaths; Kissidougou, 7 cases and 5 deaths; Dabola, 4 cases and 4 deaths, Djinguiraye, 1 case and 1 death; and Boffa, 4 cases and 0 deaths. \n\nThe total number of cases in isolation is 13 (9 in Gueckedou, 3 in Telimele, and 1 in Conakry).

The body was transported to and buried in Sierra Leone. The case is being investigated by both Liberia and Sierra Leone. \n\nThe number of cases remains subject to change due to reclassification, retrospective investigation, consolidation of cases and laboratory data, and enhanced surveillance. \n\nCommunity resistance, inadequate treatment facilities and insufficient human resources in certain affected areas are among challenges currently faced by the three countries in responding to the EVD outbreak.\nWHO response\n\nWHO and its partners have deployed experts to both Sierra Leone and Guinea to support and build capacity of national personnel to mount an effective EVD outbreak response including coordination, disease outbreak investigation, risk assessment, establishment of treatment facilities, case management, infection prevention and control in the newly affected districts, and social mobilization targeting the resistant communities. \n\nIn Sierra Leone, WHO and its partners have established a treatment centre in Koindu and are also coordinating the laboratory testing of samples from Kailahun district, Sierra Leone to be tested in Gueckedou, Guinea. \n\nWHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia, or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event.\n\n\nThis update has also been posted on the regional website of the WHO African Regional Office \n\n\n\n*On 2 June 2014 it was noted that this number was incorrect and it was changed from 36 to 33.",

        "Description of the Situation": "Disease outbreak news \n\n \n28 May 2014 -\nOn 26 May 2014, the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) of China notified WHO of 3 additional laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus.\n\nDetails of the cases are as follows:\n\nA 40 year-old male from Anqing City, Anhui Province. He had onset of symptoms on 9 May, was admitted to a hospital on 17 May, and is currently in a critical condition. \nA 69 year-old male from Huangshan City, Anhui Province. He had onset of symptoms on 14 May, was admitted to a hospital on 16 May, and is currently in a critical condition. \nA 58 year-old male from Ma\u2019anshan City, Anhui Province. He had onset of symptoms on 8 May, was admitted to a hospital on 19 May, and is currently in a critical condition. \n\n \n\nThe Chinese Government has taken the following surveillance and control measures:\n\n\nstrengthen surveillance and situation analysis;\nreinforce case management and treatment; and\nconduct risk communication with the public and release information.\n\nCurrent risk assessment\n\nThe overall risk assessment has not changed (see WHO Risk Assessment under 'Related links').\n\nThe previous report of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus detection in live poultry exported from mainland China to Hong Kong SAR shows the potential for the virus to spread through movement of live poultry. At this time there is no indication that international spread of avian influenza A(H7N9) has occurred. However as the virus infection does not cause signs of disease in poultry, continued surveillance is needed. Further sporadic human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) infection are expected in affected and possibly neighbouring areas.\n\nShould human cases from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during or after arrival. If this were to occur, community level spread is unlikely as the virus does not have the ability to transmit easily among humans. There has been no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission, therefore the risk of ongoing international spread of H7N9 virus by travellers is low. \nWHO advice\n\nWHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid poultry farms, or contact with animals in live bird markets, or entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travellers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.\n\nWHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. \n\nAs always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.\n\nWHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, in order to ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005), and continue national health preparedness actions.",

While asymptomatic at the time of screening, the investigation revealed that he had mild cough on 1 May 2014. He has no comorbidities and no travel history. He had contact with animals (cows and sheep but not camels), but has no history of consumption of raw camel products. He was admitted to hospital for isolation on 8 May and discharged on 14 May.\nA 36 year-old male from Abu Dhabi. He developed symptoms, including fever and mild breathing difficulty, on 2 May and was seen in an outpatient service on 4 May. His condition deteriorated and he was admitted to hospital on 7 May with high grade fever and developed breathing difficulty. On 9 May, he tested positive for MERS-CoV by PCR. He recovered and was discharged on 12 May. He is known to have comorbidities, but reported no contact with a laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV case and has no travel history. He also has no contact with animals and no history of consumption of raw camel products.\n\n\nContact investigations are ongoing and further information will be communicated when available.\n\nGlobally, 635 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV have officially been reported to WHO, including 193 deaths.

Health-care facilities that provide for patients suspected or confirmed to be infected with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus from an infected patient to other patients, health-care workers and visitors. Health-care workers should be educated, trained and refreshed with skills on infection prevention and control.\n\nIt is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because some have mild or unusual symptoms. For this reason, it is important that health-care workers apply standard precautions consistently with all patients \u2013 regardless of their diagnosis \u2013 in all work practices all the time.\n\nDroplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to all patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection. Contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection. Airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.\n\nPatients should be managed as potentially infected when the clinical and epidemiological clues strongly suggest MERS-CoV, even if an initial test on a nasopharyngeal swab is negative. Repeat testing should be done when the initial testing is negative, preferably on specimens from the lower respiratory tract.\n\nHealth-care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations. All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.\n\nPeople at high risk of severe disease due to MERS-CoV should avoid close contact with animals when visiting farms or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. For the general public, when visiting a farm or a barn, general hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals, avoiding contact with sick animals, and following food hygiene practices, should be adhered to.\n\nWHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.",

        "Description of the Situation": "Disease outbreak news \n\n \n22 May 2014 -\nOn 19 May 2014, the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) of China notified WHO of 4 additional laboratory confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus.\n\nDetails of the cases are as follows:\n\nA 66 year-old male from Wuxi City, Jiangsu Province. He had onset of symptoms on 20 April, was admitted to a hospital on 25 April, and is currently in a critical condition. He had a history of exposure to live poultry.\nA 86 year-old male from Meizhou City, Guandong Province. He had onset of symptoms on 4 May, was admitted to a hospital on 9 May, and is currently in a critical condition. He had a history of exposure to live poultry.\nA 71 year-old male, farmer from Meizhou City, Guandong Province. He had onset of symptoms on 10 May, was admitted to a hospital on 12 May, and is currently in a mild condition. He had a history of exposure to live poultry.\nA 37 year-old male from Zhongshan City, Guandong Province. He had onset of symptoms on 12 May, was admitted to a hospital on 13 May, and is currently in a critical condition. He had a history of exposure to live poultry.\n\n \n\nThe Chinese Government has taken the following surveillance and control measures:\n\n\nstrengthen surveillance and situation analysis;\nreinforce case management and treatment; and\nconduct risk communication with the public and release information.\n\nCurrent risk assessment\n\nThe overall risk assessment has not changed (see WHO Risk Assessment under 'Related links').\n\nThe previous report of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus detection in live poultry exported from mainland China to Hong Kong SAR shows the potential for the virus to spread through movement of live poultry. At this time there is no indication that international spread of avian influenza A(H7N9) has occurred. However as the virus infection does not cause signs of disease in poultry, continued surveillance is needed. Further sporadic human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) infection are expected in affected and possibly neighbouring areas.\n\nShould human cases from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during or after arrival. If this were to occur, community level spread is unlikely as the virus does not have the ability to transmit easily among humans. There has been no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission, therefore the risk of ongoing international spread of H7N9 virus by travellers is low. \nWHO advice\n\nWHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid poultry farms, or contact with animals in live bird markets, or entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travellers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.\n\nWHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. \n\nAs always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.\n\nWHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, in order to ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005), and continue national health preparedness actions.",

Since the last update of 9 May 2014, there have been five new cases confirmed by ebolavirus PCR and no new deaths among the confirmed cases. \n\nReclassification of cases, retrospective investigation, and harmonization of data have brought the total number of confirmed cases to 138, including 92 deaths; 67 probable cases, 57 deaths (3 new probable deaths in the community); and 43 suspected cases (22 deaths).\nThe geographical distribution of clinical cases of EVD since the beginning of the outbreak is as follows: Conakry (50 cases, including 24 deaths), Guekedou (163/119), Macenta (22/17), Kissidougou (8/6), Dabola (4/4), and Djinguiraye (1/1). \n\nThe cumulative total of laboratory confirmed cases and deaths since the beginning of the outbreak is: Conakry (40 cases, including 20 deaths); Guekedou (83/60); Macenta (12/10); Kissidougou (2/1); and Dabola (1/1).\n\nThere have been no new cases of EVD in Kissidougou since 1 April, Macenta since 9 April, and Conakry since 26 April. In Djinguiraye and Dabola, no new cases have been reported since the end of March 2014. If no additional cases are identified in Conakry, the observation period for those individuals identified through contact tracing will end on 17 May.\n\nIn Guekedou, the date of isolation of the most recent cases is 11 May 2014. A total of 480 contacts (5 in Conakry, 475 in Guekedou) are under follow up.\n\nThe number of cases remains subject to change due to reclassification and consolidation of cases and laboratory data, enhanced surveillance activities, and contact tracing activities. Introduction of ebolavirus serology to test PCR negative clinical cases is also likely to change the final number of laboratory confirmed cases. \nLiberia and Sierra Leone\n\nThere have been no new alerts in both Liberia and Sierra Leone. Liberia is preparing to host a cross-border meeting with C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Sierra Leone and surveillance activities have been enhanced in districts bordering Guinea. \nWHO response\n\nWHO continues to support the Ministries of Health of Guinea and Liberia in their EVD prevention and control activities. As of 14 May, 118 experts have been deployed to assist in the response. This includes 56 experts deployed through the global WHO surge mechanism, 35 international experts from among partner institutions of the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), 10 externally recruited consultants, and 17 WHO staff who were locally repurposed.\n\nTo date, 90 experts have been deployed to Guinea, 22 to Liberia, two to Sierra Leone, and four to the WHO Regional Office for Africa. \n\nAn additional, 7 deployments are planned in the disciplines of medical anthropology, clinical case management, surveillance and epidemiology, laboratory services, logistics, and risk and media communications. \n\nWHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea or Liberia based on the current information available for this event.\n\n\nThis update has also been posted on the regional website of the WHO African Regional Office",

She has several comorbidities, but is also to have no history of travel, no contact with laboratory confirmed cases or with animals, and no history of raw camel milk consumption.\nA 61 year-old male expatriate tailor shop owner residing in Abu Dhabi. He has been hospitalized since 18 March 2014 as a case of atrial fibrillation and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Samples collected on 29 April 2014 and sent to the laboratory tested positive for MERS-CoV on 1 May 2014. Currently, he is in the ICU in a critical but stable condition. He is reported have no history of travel, no contact with laboratory confirmed cases or with animals, and no history of raw camel milk consumption.\nA 34 year-old female expatriate residing in Abu Dhabi. She is asymptomatic. She was detected through mass screening of her work place without being in contact with any known case. Samples collected on 29 April 2014 and sent to the laboratory tested positive for MERS-CoV on 1 May 2014. She is reported to have no comorbidities, no history of travel, and no contact with laboratory confirmed cases or with animals. She is a vegetarian and consumes only pasteurized dairy products.\n\n\nOne additional case not previously reported was provided to WHO on 8 April 2014 by the National IHR Focal Point for UAE:\n\nA 59 year-old male farm employee residing in Abu Dhabi. The patient had onset of symptoms on 28 March 2014 with febrile illness. On 30 March 2014, he was admitted to hospital and was being treated in the ICU. On 3 April 2014, he was laboratory confirmed with MERS-CoV. He is reported to have had contact with an admitted laboratory confirmed case of MERS-CoV.\n\n\nPublic health authorities continued to carry out contact tracing and an epidemiological investigation. Further developments will be communicated when available.\nJordan\n\nOn 11 May 2014, the National IHR Focal Point for Jordan reported to WHO an additional case of MERS-CoV. \n\nThe case is a 50 year-old male health-care worker, Jordanian citizen, and resident of Zarka Governorate. He presented with symptoms on 7 May 2014. On 10 May his condition worsened and he was diagnosed with pneumonia after performing a chest X-ray. He was admitted to hospital the same day and tested positive for MERS-CoV. The patient has a history of contact with two MERS-confirmed cases. He is in a stable condition. He is reported to have no history of travel and no history of contact with animals.\n\nTracing and screening of six family members and 24 health-care workers for MERS-CoV is currently ongoing.\nLebanon\n\nOn 8 May, 2014, the National IHR Focal Point (NFP) of Lebanon reported the first laboratory-confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection.\n\nOn 22 April 2014, a 60 year-old male health-care worker and national of Lebanon complained of high-grade fever. On 27 April 2014, he was diagnosed with pneumonia and was admitted to the hospital on 30 April 2014. His symptoms included fever, dyspnoea, and productive cough. On 2 May 2014, he tested positive for MERS-CoV. He is reported to have comorbidities. He was in a stable condition in hospital and was released on 7 May 2014.\n\nThe patient is reported to have no contact with laboratory confirmed cases or with animals and no history of raw camel milk consumption. No history of travel was reported in the 14 days prior to onset of symptoms. \n\nThe patient is known to travel throughout the Gulf region, particularly to Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and UAE; investigations into the patient\u2019s travel history are ongoing. His most recent travel was five weeks prior to symptom onset to UAE and eight weeks prior to symptom onset to Jeddah where he visited one of the hospitals that had been facing an upsurge of MERS-CoV cases.\n\nGlobally, 572 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV have officially been reported to WHO, including 173 deaths. The global total includes all of the cases reported in this update (18), plus 58 laboratory confirmed cases officially reported to WHO from Saudi Arabia between 5 and 9 May. WHO is working with Saudi Arabia for additional information on these cases and will provide further updates as soon as possible.\nWHO advice\n\nBased on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.\n\nInfection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. Health-care facilities that provide for patients suspected or confirmed to be infected with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus from an infected patient to other patients, health-care workers and visitors. Health care workers should be educated, trained and refreshed with skills on infection prevention and control.\n\nIt is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because some have mild or unusual symptoms. For this reason, it is important that health-care workers apply standard precautions consistently with all patients \u2013 regardless of their diagnosis \u2013 in all work practices all the time.\n\nDroplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to all patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection. Contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection. Airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.\n\nPatients should be managed as potentially infected when the clinical and epidemiological clues strongly suggest MERS-CoV, even if an initial test on a nasopharyngeal swab is negative. Repeat testing should be done when the initial testing is negative, preferably on specimens from the lower respiratory tract.\n\nHealth-care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations. All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.\n\nPeople at high risk of severe disease due to MERS-CoV should avoid close contact with animals when visiting farms or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. For the general public, when visiting a farm or a barn, general hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals, avoiding contact with sick animals, and following food hygiene practices, should be adhered to.\n\nWHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.",

        "Description of the Situation": "Disease outbreak news \n\n \n15 May 2014 -\nOn 12 May 2014, the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) of China notified WHO of five additional laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus.\n\nDetails of the cases are as follows:\n\nA 23 year-old male from Leping City, Jiangxi Province. He had onset of symptoms on 14 April and was admitted to hospital on 27 April. He is currently in a mild condition. The patient had a history of exposure to live poultry.\nA 74 year-old female from Yueyang City, Hunan Province. She had onset of symptoms on 23 April and was admitted to a hospital on 29 April. She is currently in a severe condition. The patient had a history of exposure to live poultry.\nA 53 year-old female from Shenzhen City, Guandong Province. She had onset of symptoms on 15 April and was admitted to a hospital on 28 April. She is currently in a mild condition. The patient had a history of exposure to live poultry.\nA 63 year-old male from Yanji City, Jilin Province. He had onset of symptoms on 27 April and was admitted to a hospital on 30 April. He is currently in a critical condition. No information was available on exposure.\nA 50 year-old male from Zhongshan City, Guandong Province. He had onset of symptoms on 2 May and was admitted to a hospital on 6 May. He is currently in a critical condition. The patient had a history of exposure to live poultry.\n\n \n\nThe Chinese Government has taken the following surveillance and control measures:\n\n\nstrengthen surveillance and situation analysis;\nreinforce case management and treatment; and\nconduct risk communication with the public and release information.\n\nCurrent risk assessment\n\nThe overall risk assessment has not changed (see WHO Risk Assessment under 'Related links').\n\nThe previous report of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus detection in live poultry exported from mainland China to Hong Kong SAR shows the potential for the virus to spread through movement of live poultry, at this time there is no indication that international spread of avian influenza A(H7N9) has occurred. However as the virus infection does not cause signs of disease in poultry, continued surveillance is needed. \n\nFurther sporadic human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) infection are expected in affected and possibly neighbouring areas.\n\nShould human cases from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during or after arrival. If this were to occur, community level spread is unlikely as the virus does not have the ability to transmit easily among humans. Until the virus adapts itself for efficient human-to-human transmission, the risk of ongoing international spread of H7N9 virus by travellers is low. \nWHO advice\n\nWHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid poultry farms, or contact with animals in live bird markets, or entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travellers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.\n\nWHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. \n\nAs always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.\n\nWHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, in order to ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005), and continue national health preparedness actions.",

There has been no change in the number of cases confirmed by ebolavirus PCR (127 cases) since the last update of 2 May 2014, but there have been two additional deaths: one among the confirmed cases and the other among the probable cases. This brings the number of deaths to 83. There have been no new probable or suspected cases. In addition, 55 cases (34 deaths) are classified as suspected cases. As of 7 May, one patient remains in isolation in Conakry and one in Guekedou. The date of isolation of the most recent confirmed cases is 26 April in Conakry and 1 May in Guekedou. \n\nThe geographical distribution of clinical cases of EVD since the beginning of the outbreak is as follows: Conakry (53 cases, including 24 deaths), Guekedou (149/107), Macenta (22/16), Kissidougou (6/5), Dabola (4/4), and Djingaraye (1/1).

In Djingaraye and Dabola, no new cases have been reported since the end of March 2014.\n\nThe cumulative total of laboratory confirmed cases and deaths since the beginning of the outbreak is: Conakry (40 cases, including 20 deaths); Guekedou (72/51); Macenta (13/10); Kissidougou (1/1); and Dabola (1/1). The analysis of the epidemiological data during the last three weeks shows that the number of new cases is decreasing in Guekedou.\n\nEVD prevention and control activities continue in Guekedou. These include: a suite of innovative community sensitization and social mobilization activities with community leaders, mining companies, banks, schools and universities, and local nongovernmental organizations; the dissemination of awareness messages through rural community radio and posters; the screening of films on EVD; and providing education about EVD door-to-door in affected villages or neighborhoods. \n\nThe numbers of cases and contacts remain subject to change due to consolidation of case, contact and laboratory data, enhanced surveillance activities, and contact tracing activities. The recent introduction of ebolavirus serology to test PCR negative clinical cases is also likely to change the final number of laboratory confirmed cases. \n\nAs the incubation period for EVD can be up to three weeks, it is likely that the Guinean health authorities will report new cases in the coming weeks and additional suspected cases may also be identified in neighbouring countries.\nLiberia\n\nThere has been no change in the epidemiological situation in Liberia. The Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW) of Liberia has reported that there are no current alerts of viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF)-like illness in Liberia. Active surveillance activities continue. As of 5 May, 152 contacts have completed 21 days of follow-up and been discharged from medical surveillance. \nSierra Leone\n\nAs of 7 May, no cases of EVD have been confirmed in Sierra Leone. From 16 March to 7 May 2014, the Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MOHS) of Sierra Leone has tested 106 patients presenting with a VHF-like illness for EVD and Lassa fever. No cases of EVD have been detected using ebolavirus PCR assays while 10 patients have been confirmed with a Lassa fever virus infection. Lassa fever is endemic in Sierra Leone. Thirty-five (35 contacts) have been traced; 15 have completed 21 days of follow-up and have been discharged from medical surveillance; and 20 are under follow up. \n\nEVD preparedness and response training has been provided to 375 health-care workers, including senior district-level nursing staff, primary health-care staff, senior hospital-based nurses and clinicians, and hospital superintendents. Personal protective equipment has been prepositioned in all district hospitals, selected private and mission hospitals, and the Armed Forces hospital.

        "Description of the Situation": "Disease Outbreak News\n\n \n7 May 2014 -\nOn 15 April 2014, the IHR National Focal Point of Yemen notified WHO of a laboratory confirmed case of MERS-CoV in a 44 year-old male residing in Shibam. The patient was diagnosed as having hepatitis B and is reported to have developed symptoms on 17 March 2014, including fever, productive cough, chills, headache, muscle aches, and shortness of breath. He was admitted to hospital on 22 March 2014 in Hadramoot Governorate, and subsequently transferred on 29 March 2014 to an intensive-care unit of a private hospital in Sanaa. He was intubated, developed renal failure, and died on 31 March 2014.\n\nPrior to the patient's decline and subsequent death, on 31 March 2014 oropharyngeal specimens were collected from the patient and tested positive on 2 April 2014. On 24 April 2014, the specimens were sent to the United States\u2019 Naval Medical Research Unit-3 (NAMRU-3) for external confirmation and tested positive on 5 May 2014. Oropharyngeal specimens collected from 12 contacts of the patient tested negative at NAMRU-3.\n\nThe patient was an aircraft maintenance engineer with contact among passengers at the airport where he was working. He had no history of travel during the last month of his illness and no known contact with a confirmed case. He is reported to have visited a camel farm on a weekly basis and drank fresh raw camel milk.\nWHO advice\n\nBased on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.\n\nInfection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. Health-care facilities that provide for patients suspected or confirmed to be infected with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus from an infected patient to other patients, health-care workers and visitors. Health care workers should be educated, trained and refreshed with skills on infection prevention and control.\n\nIt is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because some have mild or unusual symptoms. For this reason, it is important that health-care workers apply standard precautions consistently with all patients \u2013 regardless of their diagnosis \u2013 in all work practices all the time.\n\nDroplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to all patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection. Contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection. Airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures. \n\nPatients should be managed as potentially infected when the clinical and epidemiological clues strongly suggest MERS-CoV, even if an initial test on a nasopharyngeal swab is negative. Repeat testing should be done when the initial testing is negative, preferably on specimens from the lower respiratory tract.\n\nHealth-care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations. All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.\n\nPeople at high risk of severe disease due to MERS-CoV should avoid close contact with animals when visiting farms or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. For the general public, when visiting a farm or a barn, general hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals, avoiding contact with sick animals, and following food hygiene practices, should be adhered to.\n\nWHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.",

        "Description of the Situation": "6 May 2014\n\n Guinea\n\nAs of 18:00 on 3 May 2014, the Ministry of Health (MOH) of Guinea has reported a cumulative total of 231 clinical cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD), including 155 deaths. There has been no change in the number of cases confirmed by ebolavirus PCR (127 cases) since the last update of 2 May 2014, but 1 additional death has been reported among confirmed cases (82 deaths). \n\nThere have been 5 new probable cases and 5 new deaths among the probable cases of EVD since the last report (currently 49 cases, including 39 deaths). In addition, 55 cases (34 deaths) are classified as suspected cases. As of 2 May, 2 patients remain in isolation in Conakry and 3 in Guekedou. All of the new cases and deaths have been reported from Guekedou. The date of isolation of the most recent confirmed cases is 26 April in Conakry and 1 May in Guekedou.\n\nThe geographical distribution of clinical cases of EVD since the beginning of the outbreak is: Conakry (53 cases, including 24 deaths), Guekedou (145/105), Macenta (22/16), Kissidougou (6/5), Dabola (4/4) and Djingaraye(1/1). There have been no new cases of EVD in Kissidougou since 1 April and in Macenta since 9 April. In Djingaraye and Dabola, no new cases have been reported since the end of March 2014.\n\nThe cumulative total of laboratory confirmed cases and deaths since the beginning of the outbreak is: Conakry (40 cases, including 20 deaths); Guekedou (72/50); Macenta (13/10); Kissidougou (1/1); and Dabola (1/1). The analysis of the epidemiological data during the last 3 weeks shows that the number of new cases is decreasing in Guekedou.\n\nEVD prevention and control activities continue in Guekedou. These include: a suite of innovative community sensitisation and social mobilisation activities with community leaders, mining companies, banks, schools and universities and local non-governmental organisations; the dissemination of awareness messages through rural community radio and as posters; the screening of films on EVD; and providing education about EVD door-to-door in affected villages or neighborhoods.\n\nThe numbers of cases and contacts remain subject to change due to consolidation of case, contact and laboratory data, enhanced surveillance activities and contact tracing activities. The recent introduction of ebolavirus serology to test PCR negative clinical cases is also likely to change the final number of laboratory confirmed cases.\n\nAs the incubation period for EVD can be up to 3 weeks, it is likely that the Guinean health authorities will report new cases in the coming weeks and additional suspected cases may also be identified in neighbouring countries.\nLiberia\n\nThere has been no change in the epidemiological situation in Liberia. The Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW) of Liberia has reported that there are no current alerts of viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF)-like illness in Liberia. Active surveillance activities continue. As of 5 May, 152 contacts have completed 21 days of follow-up and have been discharged from medical surveillance.\n\nWHO and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, United States, is facilitating training in the EpiInfo VHF application for MOHSW staff today. Training in active surveillance for county and district health officers is planned for Bong and Nimba Counties next week.\nSierra Leone\n\nAs of 3 May, no cases of EVD have been confirmed in Sierra Leone. From 16 March to 2 May 2014, the Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MOHS) of Sierra Leone has tested 105 patients presenting with a VHF-like illness for EVD and Lassa fever. \n\nNo cases of EVD have been detected using ebolavirus PCR assays while 10 patients have been confirmed with a Lassa fever virus infection. Lassa fever is endemic in Sierra Leone. Thirty-five (35 contacts) have been traced; 15 have completed 21 days of follow-up and have been discharged from medical surveillance.\n\nEVD preparedness and response training has been provided to 375 health-care workers, including senior district-level nursing staff, primary health-care staff, senior hospital\u2013based nurses and clinicians and hospital superintendents. Personal protective equipment has been prepositioned in all district hospitals, selected private and mission hospitals and the Armed Forces hospital. Active surveillance activities continue, including the investigation of all rumours of VHF-like illness.\nWHO response\n\nWHO continues to support the Ministries of Health of Guinea and Liberia in their EVD prevention and control activities. As of 5 May, 112 experts have been deployed to assist in the response.

The recent introduction of ebolavirus serology to test PCR-negative clinical cases is also likely to change the final number of laboratory confirmed cases. \n\nAs the incubation period for EVD can be up to 3 weeks, it is likely that the Guinean health authorities will report new cases in the coming weeks and additional suspected cases may also be identified in neighbouring countries.\nLiberia\n\nThe Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW) of Liberia has completed the process of revising clinical cases of EVD based on their final laboratory results. All cases which tested PCR positive or ebolavirus IgM positive have been reclassified as \u201cconfirmed acute\u201d cases. PCR negative but ebolavirus IgG positive cases are considered \u201cconfirmed convalescent\u201d cases. Following the reclassification of suspected cases, as of 2 May the total number of clinical EVD cases reported in Liberia is 13 (6 confirmed, 2 probable and 5 suspected cases), including 11 deaths. There were 2 confirmed cases in HCWs, both of whom died. There have been no new clinical cases in Liberia since 6 April. \n\nThe above criteria will be used to classify future cases of EVD in Liberia, should they occur. In addition, in the situation where neither PCR nor serological testing is carried out and/or the results of repeated testing remain equivocal, future clinical cases and deaths will classified as either probable or suspected based on the presence of a clinically compatible illness and evidence of epidemiological linkage to known confirmed case(s). \n\nWHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea or Liberia based on the current information available for this event.\n\n\nThis update has also been posted on the regional website of the WHO African Regional Office",

Repeat testing should be done when the initial testing is negative, preferably on specimens from the lower respiratory tract.\n\nHealth-care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations. All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.\n\nPeople at high risk of severe disease due to MERS-CoV should avoid close contact with animals when visiting farms or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. For the general public, when visiting a farm or a barn, general hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals, avoiding contact with sick animals, and following food hygiene practices, should be adhered to.\n\nWHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.",

        "Description of the Situation": "25 April 2014\n\n Guinea\n\nAs of 18:00 on 23 April, the Ministry of Health (MOH) of Guinea has reported a cumulative total of 218 clinical cases of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD), including 141 deaths. To date, 191 patients have been tested for ebolavirus infection and 115 cases have been laboratory confirmed, including 72 deaths. In addition, 42 cases (34 deaths) meet the probable case definition for EVD and 61 cases (35 deaths) are classified as suspected cases. Twenty-six (26) health care workers (HCW) have been affected (18 confirmed), with 16 deaths (12 confirmed). \n\nClinical cases of EVD have been reported from Conakry (58 cases, including 24 deaths), Guekedou (127/91), Macenta (22/16), Kissidougou (6/5), Dabola (4/4) and Djingaraye (1/1). Laboratory confirmed cases and deaths have been reported from Conakry (37 cases, including 19 deaths), Guekedou (63/41), Macenta (13/10), Kissidougou (1/1) and Dabola (1/1). The date of onset of the most recent clinical case, a suspected case, is 23 April while the date of isolation of the most recent confirmed case is 22 April. Two new deaths have also been reported among existing cases; one of the deaths was a patient with confirmed EVD. Thirteen (13) patients are in isolation in Conakry (6 patients, 5 confirmed), Guekedou (7 patients, all confirmed). Contact tracing activities continue in all affected areas. \n\nOverall, the epidemiological situation in Guinea has improved significantly over the last few weeks. The date of onset of the last reported case from Macenta was 24 days ago and a similar time has elapsed for Dabola (25 days), Kissigougou (26) and Djingaraye (31 days). Two incubation periods (42 days) without cases is the standard for declaring an EVD outbreak over in a particular location.\n\nThe focus of response activities at present includes clinical case management and ongoing training in hospital-based infection prevention and control (IPC). A documentary will be made on the M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) isolation facility in Guekedou. WHO, in collaboration with the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), has mobilized a new medical team comprising of IPC and intensive care physicians in support of the clinicians at the Donka Hospital in Conakry. \n\nThe numbers of cases and contacts remain subject to change due to consolidation of case, contact and laboratory data, enhanced surveillance activities and contact tracing activities. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, United States, has arrived in Guinea to further strengthen diagnostic capacity for EVD by retesting patients who were polymerase chain reaction (PCR) negative by ebolavirus serology.\n\nThe cross-border meeting on EVD response between the governments of Guinea and Liberia was successfully hosted by the Guinean government, attended by 25 participants from delegations from both countries. The overall objective of the meeting was to strengthen epidemiological surveillance and the follow up of contacts along the borders of the two countries in order to stop transmission of EVD. Key actions for implementation include: development of an action plan on the cross-border response to EVD; strengthening coordination of cross-border activities with engagement of local authorities; sharing information on the cross-border movement of suspected cases of EVD; reinforcing community awareness of EVD and ways to reduce personal and community risk of disease; and reinforcing active surveillance and contact tracing along the border as needed.\n\nAs the incubation period for EVD can be up to three weeks, it is likely that the Guinean health authorities will report new cases in the coming weeks and additional suspected cases may also be identified in neighbouring countries.\nLiberia\n\nFrom 13 March, the date of onset of the first laboratory confirmed case in Liberia, to 24 April, the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW) of Liberia has reported a total of 35 clinically compatible cases of EVD; 6 confirmed cases, 2 probable cases and 27 suspected cases. The date of onset of the most recent confirmed case was 6 April. The MOHSW has started to reclassify suspected cases against their laboratory test results. Most of the suspected cases are expected to be discarded at the end of this process. \n\nWHO, in collaboration with GOARN, is planning to replace experts who recently completed their missions in Liberia in the areas of case management, IPC and epidemiology. \nSierra Leone\n\nThe Ministry of Health and Sanitation of Sierra Leone is currently investigating 3 patients with an illness compatible with a viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF) for EVD and Lassa fever (the latter is endemic in Sierra Leone). All rumours of EVD cases are being investigated and active case finding is also ongoing. \n\nThe laboratory at the Lassa Fever isolation facility at the Kenema Government Hospital is now analysing all suspected cases of VHF for both Lassa fever and EVD. As of 24 April 2014, 98 samples collected have been tested; 10 samples tested positive for Lassa fever and the remaining 88 tested negative for both diseases. Fifteen contacts have completed 21 days of follow up while 20 contacts remain under medical observation.\n\nWHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event. \n\n\nThis update has also been posted on the regional website of the WHO African Regional Office",

She became ill on 10 April, was admitted to a hospital on 14 April and is currently in a critical condition. \nA 50 year-old man from Yongzhou City, Hunan province. He became ill on 10 April, was admitted to a hospital on 19 April and is currently in a critical condition.\n\nDetails of the cases as reported on 21 April 2014 are as follows:\n\nA 34 year-old man from Wuxi City, Jiangsu Province. He became ill on 10 April, was admitted to a hospital on 16 April, and is currently in a critical condition. \nA 55 year-old woman from Shantou City, Guangdong Province. She became ill on 6 April, was admitted to a local hospital on 17 April, and is currently in a critical condition. \n\nDetails of the cases notified on 17 April 2014 are as follows:\n\nA 60 year-old man from Changzhou City, Jiangsu Province. He became ill on 8 April, was admitted to a hospital on 13 April, and is currently in a severe condition. He had a history of contact with poultry before he became ill. \nA 70 year-old man from Tongling City, Anhui Province. He became ill on 21 March, was admitted to a hospital on 25 March, and died on 14 April. \n\n \n\nThe Chinese Government has taken the following surveillance and control measures:\n\n\nstrengthen surveillance and situation analysis;\nreinforce case management and treatment; and\nconduct risk communication with the public and release information.\n\nCurrent risk assessment\n\nThe overall risk assessment has not changed (see WHO Risk Assessment under 'Related links').\n\nThe previous report of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus detection in live poultry exported from mainland China to Hong Kong SAR shows the potential for the virus to spread through movement of live poultry, at this time there is no indication that international spread of avian influenza A(H7N9) has occurred. However as the virus infection does not cause signs of disease in poultry, continued surveillance is needed. \n\nFurther sporadic human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) infection are expected in affected and possibly neighbouring areas.\n\nShould human cases from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during or after arrival. If this were to occur, community level spread is unlikely as the virus does not have the ability to transmit easily among humans. Until the virus adapts itself for efficient human-to-human transmission, the risk of ongoing international spread of H7N9 virus by travellers is low. \nWHO advice\n\nWHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid poultry farms, or contact with animals in live bird markets, or entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travellers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.\n\nWHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. \n\nAs always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.\n\nWHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, in order to ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005), and continue national health preparedness actions.",

She has underlying medical conditions. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) on 14 April. She is reported to have no exposure to animals or a recent travel history.\n\nGlobally, from September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of a total of 253 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 93 deaths.\nCase totals published in the Disease Outbreak News on MERS-CoV on 20 April 2014, already included the 6 laboratory-confirmed cases reported from the UAE on 16 April, 2014 below.\nThe following details were provided to WHO on 16 April 2014 by the Ministry of Health UAE:\nAll the cases are from Abu Dhabi and have had close contact with a laboratory-confirmed case reported on 10 April. To date, the cases are kept in isolation in a hospital and are well.

Health-care facilities that provide for patients suspected or confirmed to be infected with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus from an infected patient to other patients, health-care workers and visitors. Health care workers should be educated, trained and refreshed with skills on infection prevention and control.\n\nIt is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because some have mild or unusual symptoms. For this reason, it is important that health-care workers apply standard precautions consistently with all patients \u2013 regardless of their diagnosis \u2013 in all work practices all the time.\n\nDroplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to all patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection. Contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection. Airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures. \n\nPatients should be managed as potentially infected when the clinical and epidemiological clues strongly suggest MERS-CoV, even if an initial test on a nasopharyngeal swab is negative. Repeat testing should be done when the initial testing is negative, preferably on specimens from the lower respiratory tract.\n\nHealth-care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations. All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course.

        "Description of the Situation": "22 April 2014\n\n Guinea\n\nAs of 18:00 on 20 April, the Ministry of Health (MOH) of Guinea has reported a cumulative total of 208 clinical cases of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD), including 136 deaths. To date, 169 patients have been tested for ebolavirus infection and 112 cases have been laboratory confirmed, including 69 deaths. In addition, 41 cases (34 deaths) meet the probable case definition for EVD and 55 cases (33 deaths) are classified as suspected cases. Twenty-five (25) health care workers (HCW) have been affected (18 confirmed), with 16 deaths (12 confirmed). \n\nClinical cases of EVD have been reported from Conakry (53 cases, including 23 deaths), Guekedou (122/87), Macenta (22/16), Kissidougou (6/5), Dabola (4/4) and Djingaraye (1/1). Laboratory confirmed cases and deaths have been reported from Conakry (37 cases, including 19 deaths), Guekedou (60/38), Macenta (13/10), Kissidougou (1/1) and Dabola (1/1). These updated figures include 3 new cases isolated on 20 April from Conakry and Guekedou, 2 of whom are laboratory confirmed. Five new deaths have also been reported among existing cases; all 5 of the deaths were patients with confirmed EVD. Twenty-one (21) patients were in isolation in Conakry (12), Guekedou (8) and Macenta (1), while 16 patients who recovered from their illness were discharged from hospital.\n\nContact tracing activities continue in all affected areas. A total of 217 contacts are currently under medical observation and 92 have completed their 21 days of follow-up.\n\nThe numbers of cases and contacts remain subject to change due to consolidation of cases, contact and laboratory data, enhanced surveillance and contact tracing activities and the continuing laboratory investigations. As the incubation period for EVD can be up to three weeks, it is likely that the Guinean health authorities will report new cases in the coming weeks and additional suspected cases may also be identified in neighbouring countries.\nLiberia\n\nFrom 13 March, the date of onset of the first laboratory confirmed case in Liberia, to 21 April, the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare of Liberia has reported a total of 34 clinically compatible cases of EVD; 6 confirmed cases, including 6 deaths, 2 probable cases and 26 suspected cases. The date of onset of the most recent confirmed case was 6 April and the date of admission of the last confirmed case was 10 April. The confirmed and probable cases were reported from Lofa and Margibi Counties, while suspected cases have been reported from Bong, Grand Cape Mount, Montserrado and Nimba Counties as a result of enhanced surveillance and contact tracing activities.\n\nThe number of confirmed cases in HCWs has been adjusted down from 3 cases to two as data are reviewed against case definitions and laboratory results. The total number of deaths has also been revised from 13 to 11 as one of the deaths has been counted in the EVD statistics for Guinea and one death occurred in a discarded case. As laboratory tests have been conducted on 32 clinical samples overall only 6 of which have tested positive for ebolavirus to date, it is anticipated that most of the suspected cases currently reported by Liberia will be reclassified as discarded and removed from the case count in the future.\n\nFollowing data review, the number of contacts now stands at 162 in total; Foya district, Lofa County, the epicentre of the EVD outbreak in Liberia accounts for 72% (116) of the total contacts followed by Margibi County (17%, 28 contacts). Fifty-nine contacts (36% of the total) have completed 21 days follow up and have been discharged from medical observation.\nSierra Leone\n\nAs of 22 April 2014, clinical samples from 19 clinically compatible cases of EVD have been tested at the Kenema Government Hospital. All 19 samples tested negative for ebolavirus. As part of enhanced surveillance activities, the Ministry of Health and Sanitation of Sierra Leone also decided to test for the presence of ebolavirus in samples from patients referred to the Lassa Fever Isolation Ward of the Kenema Hospital for the investigation of viral hemorrhagic fever-like illness who tested negative for Lassa fever virus infection. The additional 24 blood samples collected from 16 March 2014 onwards were analysed and all tested negative for ebolavirus.\n\nWHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea or Liberia based on the current information available for this event. \n\n\nThis update has also been posted on the regional website of the WHO African Regional Office",

Clinical cases of EVD have been reported from Conakry (47 cases, including 16 deaths), Guekedou (117/80), Macenta (22/16), Kissidougou (6/5), Dabola (4/4) and Djingaraye (1/1).\n\nContact tracing activities continue in all affected areas including new contacts generated by a HCW who passed away 3 days ago. In Conakry, 60 community volunteers are assisting the MOH and response partners in following up the 221 contacts currently under medical observation. Seven contacts who developed symptoms have been placed in isolation as a precautionary measure. A total of 249 contacts are being followed in Guekedou, 54 in Macenta 17 in Kissidougou, 63 in Dabola and 2 in Dingaraye.\n\nA total of 36 patients are currently in isolation; 23 in Conakry, 12 in Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou and 1 in Macenta. Clinical teams from WHO, the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) and M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) are supporting national medical and nursing staff at the Donka Hospital to strengthen patient triage, case management and infection prevention and control (IPC). Training on the safe handling of patients with EVD and the deceased was conducted jointly by the IPC and Logistics teams at the Donka hospital for staff working at the morgue, and for drivers and staff transporting patients in stretchers. A training of trainers activity for the directors of all 20 Centres de Sant\u00e9 in Conakry is planned for 17 April. IPC training is also scheduled at 2 community health centres tomorrow. \n\nNumbers of cases and contacts remain subject to change due to consolidation of cases, contact and laboratory data, enhanced surveillance and contact tracing activities and the continuing laboratory investigations.\nMali\n\nThe Ministry of Health (MOH) of Mali has on the 16th April reported that the clinical samples on the 6 suspected cases have tested negative for ebolavirus. \n\nThe samples were tested at the WHO Collaborating Centre for Arbovirus and Viral Haemorrhagic Fever of the Institut Pasteur, Dakar, Senegal. The samples were also tested using real-time PCR at the newly established, mobile high security laboratory at the SEREFO Center for HIV and TB Training and Research, University of Bamako. Malian laboratory experts from the SEREFO Center, the National Institute of Public Health (INRSP), the Centre National d'Appui \u00e0 la lutte contre la Maladie (CNAM), the National Blood Transfusion Centre (CNTS) and the Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Science, Technics and Technology, Bamako (FMOS) were trained in ebolavirus diagnosis by staff of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH). \n\nAs of 16 April, no new suspected cases have been reported in Mali. \n\nContinuing preparedness and response activities include raising awareness among health-care workers and the broader community about EVD and reinforcing personal and community-based risk reduction strategies. The need for strict adherence with infection prevention and control measures within health-care facilities remains a key intervention.\n\nWHO is supporting the national health authorities of Mali, Guinea and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire in the planning of a cross-border meeting on Ebola virus disease. Response partners supporting the MOH include WHO, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), MSF, the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO), Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD), the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), the NIH and the UN Children's Rights and Emergency Relief Organization (UNICEF).\nLiberia\n\nAs of 16 April the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW) of Liberia has reported a cumulative total of 27 clinical cases of EVD, including 13 deaths attributed to EVD. One new suspected case reported yesterday from Nimba County has been laboratory confirmed as a case of Lassa fever. Two patients remain hospitalised and 33 contacts remain under medical observation. The MOHSW commissioned a new ebolavirus laboratory on 16 April in collaboration with Metabiota.\n\nThe MOHSW, in collaboration with WHO and the GOARN team in Liberia, has conducted visits to the John F. Kennedy Medical Center in Monrovia and the Redemption Hospital, New Kru Town in Montserrado County, and conducted the first training in case management, triage and infection prevention and control.\nSierra Leone\n\nOn 15 April, the Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MOHS) provided a consolidated report of surveillance activities conducted in that country from 19 March onwards. A total of 12 suspected cases have been identified during that period. Two previously reported suspected EVD deaths occurred in individuals from one family who died in Guinea and their bodies repatriated to Sierra Leone for burial. All of the 15 case contacts have completed 21 days of medical follow-up and have remained well. The Metabiota laboratory team working at the Kenema Government Hospital Lassa Fever Isolation Unit have received and tested clinical samples from 11 of the suspected cases using 2 different real-time PCR protocols for Ebola Zaire, other viral haemorrhagic fevers and important locally endemic pathogens. All of the samples have tested negative for ebolavirus and the other pathogens included in the test panel.\n\nFollow up on rumours of EVD cases and active case finding is ongoing in Sierra Leone. Metabiota in collaboration with the MOHS have conducted training of trainers for 75 clinicians and nurses from the main referral government, private and mission hospitals in the 13 districts on EVD preparedness and response at the Kenema Lassa Fever unit. Multimedia community sensitisation activities are also continuing.\n\nWHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia, Mali or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event. \n\n\nThis update has also been posted on the regional website of the WHO African Regional Office",

        "Description of the Situation": "Disease outbreak news \n\n \n17 April 2014 -\nIn Equatorial Guinea, three new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases have been reported on 14 April 2014, the first polio in the country since 1999. Genetic sequencing indicates these cases are linked to an ongoing WPV1 outbreak in Cameroon which has subsequently been detected in Equatorial Guinea. The cases had onset of paralysis on 28 January 2014, 19 January 2014 and 24 March 2014, from Centro Sur, Bioko Norte and Litoral. Outbreak response in Equatorial Guinea is currently being planned, including National Immunization Days (NIDs) with bivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV) on 21-24 April 2014. An estimated 40% of children are fully immunized against polio in the country. \n\nOn 17 March 2014, WHO had elevated the risk assessment of international spread of polio from Cameroon to \u2018very high\u2019 (see previous polio outbreak news under 'related links'). The risk assessment was elevated due to: confirmation of three additional WPV1 cases (with onset of paralysis on 6, 25 and 31 January 2014) from three new regions of Cameroon, confirming continued WPV transmission and geographic expansion of infected areas following detection of four cases in October 2013; gaps in surveillance; and, influx of vulnerable refugee populations from Central African Republic. \n\nThe confirmation of new cases in Cameroon resulted in planning additional emergency outbreak response activities, including converting a subnational immunization campaign to a full nationwide activity on 11-13 April 2014, and implementing nationwide campaigns in May and June 2014. Critical to success will be to ensure substantial improvement in the quality of immunization campaigns that reach all children multiple times with OPV. Equally important will be efforts to rapidly improve the quality of surveillance so that the full extent of the outbreak can be determined and tracked.\n\nImmunity levels and surveillance sensitivity are also being assessed in neighbouring countries, in particular in Gabon and the Republic of Congo. In Gabon, a nationwide immunization campaign is planned for 22-26 April 2014 (targeting all children aged less than 15 years), and in the Republic of Congo, a nationwide activity will be conducted on 1 May 2014. \n\nIt is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases in order to rapidly detect any new virus importations and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction.\n\nWHO\u2019s International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to and from polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio.",

Health-care facilities that provide for patients suspected or confirmed to be infected with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus from an infected patient to other patients, health-care workers and visitors. Health care workers should be educated, trained and refreshed with skills on infection prevention and control.\n\nIt is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because some have mild or unusual symptoms. For this reason, it is important that health-care workers apply standard precautions consistently with all patients \u2013 regardless of their diagnosis \u2013 in all work practices all the time.\n\nDroplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to all patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection. Contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection. Airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures. \n\nPatients should be managed as potentially infected when the clinical and epidemiological clues strongly suggest MERS-CoV, even if an initial test on a nasopharyngeal swab is negative. Repeat testing should be done when the initial testing is negative, preferably on specimens from the lower respiratory tract.\n\nHealth-care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations. All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.\n\nPeople at high risk of severe disease due to MERS-CoV should avoid close contact with animals when visiting farms or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. For the general public, when visiting a farm or a barn, general hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals, avoiding contact with sick animals, and following food hygiene practices, should be adhered to.\n\nWHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.",

The patient was not known to have any chronic disease. He did not have a recent history of travel or contact with animals or with a previously laboratory-confirmed case. \n\nThe concerned health authorities in the UAE are conducting investigations into the contacts of the case.\n \n\nGlobally, from September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of a total of 228 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 92 deaths.\nWHO advice\n\nBased on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.\n\nInfection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. Health-care facilities that provide for patients suspected or confirmed to be infected with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus from an infected patient to other patients, health-care workers and visitors. Health care workers should be educated, trained and refreshed with skills on infection prevention and control.\n\nIt is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because some have mild or unusual symptoms. For this reason, it is important that health-care workers apply standard precautions consistently with all patients \u2013 regardless of their diagnosis \u2013 in all work practices all the time.\n\nDroplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to all patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection. Contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection. Airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures. \n\nPatients should be managed as potentially infected when the clinical and epidemiological clues strongly suggest MERS-CoV, even if an initial test on a nasopharyngeal swab is negative. Repeat testing should be done when the initial testing is negative, preferably on specimens from the lower respiratory tract.\n\nHealth-care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations. All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.\n\nPeople at high risk of severe disease due to MERS-CoV should avoid close contact with animals when visiting farms or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. For the general public, when visiting a farm or a barn, general hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals, avoiding contact with sick animals, and following food hygiene practices, should be adhered to.\n\nWHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.",

        "Description of the Situation": "10 April 2014\n\n Guinea\n\nAs of 9 April, a cumulative total of 158 clinically compatible cases, including 101 deaths have been officially reported. Laboratory investigations continue at the Institut Pasteur (IP) Dakar laboratory in Conakry (65 samples tested, of which 38 are positive by PCR for ebolavirus) and at the European Union Mobile Laboratory (EMLab) team in Guekedou (38 samples tested/28 positive). \n\nA total of 66 clinical cases have been laboratory confirmed (42%), while 87 of the remaining clinical cases are classified as probable cases and 4 as suspected cases. Twenty-four of the 101 deaths have been laboratory confirmed. Six districts of Guinea have reported patients \u2013 Conakry (20 patients, all laboratory confirmed), Guekedou (96 cases/32 confirmed), Macenta (28 cases/12 confirmed), Kissidougou (9 cases/1 confirmed) and Dabola and Djingaraye combined (5 cases/1 confirmed). \n\nThe date of onset of the most recently identified suspected clinical cases in Conakry and Guekedou was 8 April. One additional health-care worker (HCW) has been reported since the 7 April update, bringing the total to 15 (10 laboratory confirmed and 5 probable cases). Medical observation is continuing for 488 contacts while 453 have been discharged from follow-up. No new contacts were identified since 8 April.\n\nGuinea\u2019s Ministry of Health (MOH) Clinical Care sub-committee has agreed on a program of assessment and training in major hospitals and other clinical locations in Conakry. WHO continues to support HCW training in case management and infection prevention and control (ICP). ICP has been reinforced in the Kip\u00e9 and Donka Hospitals, Conakry, and in the prefectural hospitals of Guekedou, Macenta and Kissidougou. Outreach clinical services to affected communities are also being provided by teams of clinicians from the Guinea MOH, MSF and WHO.\nLiberia\n\nAs of 10 April, the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW) of Liberia has reported a cumulative total of 5 laboratory confirmed cases and 20 suspected cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD). The date of onset of the most recent confirmed case is 6 April, with 6 patients currently hospitalised. Lofa County accounts for 32% of the clinical cases reported to date (4 laboratory confirmed and 6 suspected cases) followed by Margibi County (27%, 1 confirmed and 5 suspected cases). \n\nOther Counties at risk include Bong (4 suspected cases) and Nimba (3 suspected cases). Montserrado and Grand Cape Mount Counties have each reported one suspected case. At present 32 contacts remain under medical observation. The cumulative number of 12 deaths are being attributed to EVD; Lofa (9), Nimba (1), Margibi (1) and Montserrado (1). All 5 laboratory confirmed cases have died. Laboratory confirmed deaths have occurred in Lofa County (4) and Margibi County (1).\n\nThe MOHSW is convening daily meetings of the national task force under the leadership of the Chief Medical Officer. Daily coordination meetings with partners are also held by local government authorities in Monrovia, Lofa, Bong, Margibi, Nimba and Cape Mount Counties. Response activities continue with an emphasis on HCW training, risk communications, including daily press briefings, airing of EVD public education messages in local dialects and a variety of social mobilisation activities. Local leaders are engaged in public awareness campaigns through the network of traditional and religious leaders and traditional healers.\nMali\n\nAs of 10 April, the Ministry of Health (MOH) of Mali reports a cumulative total of 6 suspected cases after 2 suspected cases tested negative for ebolavirus and other viral haemorrhagic fever viruses in assays conducted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta. Clinical samples have been collected from all of the suspected cases to date. The samples from the remaining 6 suspected cases have been dispatched to the Institut Pasteur, Dakar, for testing. The patients who previously tested negative have been released from medical follow-up and counselling has been provided to their families. \n\nThe isolation facility at the Centre National d\u2019Appui \u00e0 la lutte contre les Maladies (CNAM), Bamako, designed for the management of cases of Lassa fever, is receiving the suspected cases of EVD. Suspected cases have also been reported from Kour\u00e9mal\u00e9 (2) and Bankoumana (1) in Koulikoro Region of Mali. The MOH is also working with response partners to strengthen: social mobilisation and public risk communications about EVD, infection prevention and control, contact tracing and resource mobilisation, including access to additional personal protective equipment (PPE) for HCWs and essential medicines.\nSierra Leone\n\nAlthough the epidemiological situation in Sierra Leone remains unchanged, the Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MOHS) continues to lead intensive EVD preparedness activities. \n\nSeven teams, each comprising of a director from the MOHS, a program officer of the Disease Prevention and Control directorate and a program officer from the national Health Education program have been dispatched to each of districts bordering Liberia and Guinea (Kambia, Kenema, Koinadugu, Kailahun, Bombali, Pujehun and Kono districts) to assess district preparedness with local authorities, including community-wide approaches to EVD preparedness and response and to preposition supplies. \n\nPlanned activities include training of senior medical and nursing staff at the Kenema Government Hospital\u2019s Lassa Fever Unit and the training of port health and surveillance officers in Freetown.\nWHO's response\n\nWHO, in collaboration with technical partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) has deployed field laboratory support, and continues to identify and deploy experts in anthropology, epidemiology and data management, outbreak logistics, clinical case management and infection prevention and control, social mobilisation, risk communications and outbreak coordination to support the response in all of the affected countries. Over 50 experts have been deployed to date and response supplies, including PPE and a variety of EVD communication and education materials for local adaptation, have been dispatched to affected and neighbouring countries.\n\nAs EVD in West Africa continues to evolve, the number of reported cases and deaths, contacts under medical observation and the number of laboratory results are subject to change due to consolidation of case, contact and laboratory data, enhanced surveillance and contact tracing activities and ongoing laboratory investigations.\n\nWHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia, Mali or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event. \n\n\nThis update has also been posted on the regional website of the WHO African Regional Office",

Until the virus adapts itself for efficient human-to-human transmission, the risk of ongoing international spread of H7N9 virus by travellers is low. \nWHO advice\n\nWHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid poultry farms, or contact with animals in live bird markets, or entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water.

The total number includes 86 deaths (CFR 60%). New cases have been reported from Conakry, Guekedou and Macenta; 23 patients are currently in isolation units. The date of onset of the most recent laboratory confirmed case is 3 April.\n\nThe current number of clinical and confirmed cases and deaths by place of report is Conakry (18 cases, including 5 deaths), Guekedou (85 cases/59 deaths), Macenta (27 cases/14 deaths), Kissidougou (9 cases/5 deaths), and Dabola and Djingaraye combined (4 cases/3 deaths). Sixteen of the 18 clinical cases in Conakry have been laboratory confirmed for EVD. \n\nThere has been no increase in the number of affected health-care workers (HCW) from the 14 reported previously, including 8 deaths; 11 of the affected HCWs are laboratory confirmed cases. Sixteen of the 86 deaths overall are laboratory confirmed, 65 are classified as probable cases and 5 as suspected cases.\n\nCase investigation and contact tracing are continuing, with 623 contacts requiring medical follow-up; this includes 74 new contacts identified on 3 April while 49 have been released from observation as they have remained well after the maximum incubation period for EVD of 21 days following the last exposure to a case.\n\nLaboratory support for the investigation is being provided by Institut Pasteur Dakar, Senegal, and the mobile laboratory in Guekedou. Reference laboratory functions have been provided by Institut Pasteur Lyon, France, the Bernhard-Nocht Institute of Tropical Medicine Hamburg, Germany, and the Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie (CIRI) laboratory in Lyon, France. \n\nWHO, in collaboration with technical partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) has deployed field laboratory support, and experts in anthropology, epidemiology, logistics, clinical case management and infection prevention and control and outbreak coordination to support the response in Guinea.\n\nThe Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW) of Liberia has reported 18 suspected and 2 confirmed cases of EBV, including 7 deaths, since 24 March (CFR 31%); 7 patients are currently in an isolation unit while 2 suspected cases have been discharged. Four new clinically compatible cases were reported on 4 April. One of the suspected cases is in a health care-worker. Both of the laboratory confirmed cases, sisters from Lofa County, have died.\n\nThe suspected cases include a hunter treated at a hospital in Tapita, Nimba County, who died shortly after presenting to the health facility and a 3 year-old boy with a clinically compatible illness who had travelled from Guinea. The deceased hunter gave no history of contact with known cases in Liberia or Guinea and his exposure is being investigated to exclude transmission from an animal source (bush meat). The laboratory results for both of these suspected cases are pending. \n\nThe MOHSW has placed 46 contacts under medical observation, including those of the second confirmed case who travelled from Foyah, Lofa Country, to Monrovia, Montserrado Country, and then to Firestone in Margibi County. A total of 21 clinical samples have been sent to Conakry, Guinea, for laboratory testing. Counties of concern for EVD in Liberia include Lofa, Bong, Nimba, Margibi and Montserrado. \n\nIn response, Liberia has been scaling up activities to prevent the further spread of EVD. The National Task Force is conducting daily coordination meetings with response partners. WHO continues to provide technical expertise to the MOHSW, including public communications, providing a high level briefing on EVD prevention and control to the joint session of both houses of parliament and mobilising experts in epidemiology and infection prevention and control. \n\nThe WHO Country Office in Liberia is working closely with the MOHSW to carry out needs assessments in areas such as procurement and the supply chain for critical materials and equipment need in the response to the outbreak. WHO is also working with the health information systems team at the MOHSW to further develop templates for case-based data collection and to track technical assistance. Additional deployments of regional experts, and partners in GOARN, are planned to support coordination activities, infection prevention and control, risk communications and social mobilisation.\n\nAt the request of the MOHSW and WHO, the Metabiota Laboratory in Kenema, Sierra Leone, will install Real-Time Zaire ebolavirus-specific PCR, a pan-filo PCR, Lassa virus PCR, yellow fever and Marburg virus PCRs among other assays. This technology is being transferred from its laboratory in Kenema, Sierra Leone. Metabiota will also provide training to laboratory staff in Liberia. \n\nMedical supplies and equipment have been provided by WHO, UNHCR, MSF, Save the Children and other partners, including personal protective equipment for health care facilities. Seven isolation units have been established in 5 counties. M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) is conducting training for health-care workers in the affected counties on case management, including on setting up isolation facilities. An additional 60 HCWs have been trained in Margibi County. \n\nCommunity education and social mobilisation activities have been strongly supported by the media and telecommunications sectors in Liberia. Local government officials, community and religious leaders and traditional healers have been approached to support the MOHSW in prevention and control activities; however, additional resources are needed to expand surveillance and health promotion and social mobilisation activities to schools, religious gatherings, market places and work places. Plans are also underway to mobilise the public through house-to-house visits. \n\nThe Ministry of Health of Mali has notified WHO of 4 patients suspected to have a viral haemorrhagic fever who presented for health care in Sibiribougou, Koulikoro Region of Mali. Two of the suspected cases had travelled from Guinea. The patients were placed in isolation pending epidemiological investigations and laboratory testing. Contact tracing is underway. Clinical samples have been sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, United States, for testing. Epidemiological surveillance is being enhanced on the ground and Rapid Response Teams are being mobilised to identify and treat suspected cases should others present. An isolation unit has been prepared in Bamako and units are also being installed in other locations. Information hotlines are being made available to the public. \n\nThere has been no change in the situation in Sierra Leone following the deaths of 2 probable cases of EVD in one family who died in Guinea and their bodies repatriated to Sierra Leone. The office of the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) is coordinating all operations involving suspected cases of Ebola as well as the follow-up investigations. Enhanced surveillance and public education activities are continuing. \n\nSenior officials from the Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MOHS) have visited border crossings between Sierra Leone and Guinea to sensitise border authorities about current prevention and response plans and public health medical officers are visiting border communities to support social mobilisation activities. Metabiota Laboratory in Kenema working under the MOHS and with the WHO Country Office in Sierra Leone, has established a full suite of ebolavirus-specific assays and differential diagnostics for other important viral haemorrhagic fevers that are locally endemic. The full range of assays is described in the section of this report for Metabiota activities in Liberia.\n\nAs this is a rapidly changing situation, the number of reported cases and deaths, contacts under medical observation and the number of laboratory results are subject to daily changes due to consolidation of case, contact and laboratory data, enhanced surveillance and contact tracing activities and ongoing laboratory investigations.\n\nWHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone or Mali based on the current information available for this event. \n\n\nThis update has also been posted on the regional website of the WHO African Regional Office",

Suspected cases have also been reported along the border with Guinea in Sierra Leone, but none of these have so far tested positive. This is the first time the disease has been detected in West Africa.",
        "Description of the Situation": "Disease Outbreak News\n\n \n3 April 2014 -\nWHO is supporting the national authorities in the response to an outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD; formerly known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever). The outbreak is now confirmed to be caused by a strain of ebolavirus with very close homology (98%) to the Zaire ebolavirus. This is the first time the disease has been detected in West Africa. \n\nCases were first reported from forested areas in south-eastern Guinea. The outbreak has rapidly evolved and several districts and Conakry have reported cases and deaths caused by EVD. A small number of suspected cases and deaths has also been reported from neighbouring countries with all of them having crossed from Guinea. Confirmed cases have been reported from Guinea and Liberia.\n\n\nLatest information on suspected and confirmed cases and deaths\n\n\n\nGenus Ebolavirus is one of three members of the Filoviridae family (filovirus), along with genus Marburgvirus and genus Cuevavirus. Genus Ebolavirus comprises five distinct species: Bundibugyo ebolavirus (BDBV); Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV); Reston ebolavirus (RESTV); Sudan ebolavirus (SUDV); and Ta\u00ef Forest ebolavirus (TAFV). BDBV, EBOV, and SUDV have been associated with large EVD outbreaks in Africa, whereas RESTV and TAFV have not. Samples taken from patients in this outbreak have tested positive for EBOV. \nInfection and transmission\n\nIn Africa, fruit bats are believed to be the natural hosts of Ebola virus. The virus is transmitted from wildlife to people through contact with infected fruit bats, or through intermediate hosts, such as monkeys, apes, or pigs that have themselves become infected through contact with bat saliva or faeces. \n\nPeople may then become infected through contact with infected animals, either in the process of slaughtering or through consumption of blood, milk, or raw or undercooked meat. \n\nThe virus is then passed from person to person through direct contact with the blood, secretions or other bodily fluids of infected persons, or from contact with contaminated needles or other equipment in the environment. \nSigns and symptoms\n\nEVD, which has a case fatality rate of up to 90%, is a severe acute viral illness often characterized by the sudden onset of fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache, nausea and sore throat. This is followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, impaired kidney and liver function, and in some cases, both internal and external bleeding. Laboratory findings frequently include low white blood cell and platelet counts and elevated liver enzymes. \n\nThe incubation period, the time interval from infection with the virus to onset of symptoms, is 2 to 21 days. People remain infectious as long as their blood and secretions contain the virus, a period that has been reported to be as long as 61 days after onset of illness. \nDiagnosis and treatment\n\nWhen considering the diagnosis of EVD, other, more common diseases should not be overlooked; for example, malaria, typhoid fever, shigellosis, cholera, leptospirosis, plague, rickettsiosis, relapsing fever, meningitis, hepatitis and other viral haemorrhagic fevers. \n\nDefinitive diagnosis of EVD is made through laboratory testing. Because samples from patients are a source of infection risk for others, testing is conducted under maximum biological containment conditions.\n\nNo vaccine is available, nor is there any specific treatment. Severely ill patients require intensive supportive care. Patients are frequently dehydrated and require oral rehydration with solutions containing electrolytes, or intravenous fluids. \nPreventative measures\n\nRaising awareness of the risk factors for infection and the protective measures that should be taken is the only way to reduce human infection and subsequent deaths. Close unprotected physical contact with Ebola patients should be avoided. Appropriate use of gloves and personal protective equipment (including hand hygiene before putting on, and especially after taking off personal protective equipment) should be practised when taking care of ill patients at home. Regular hand washing is required after visiting patients in hospital, as well as after taking care of patients at home.\n\nAlmost all transmission of the virus to health-care workers has been reported when basic infection control measures have not been observed. Health-care workers caring for any patient should practice standard precautions. When caring for patients with suspected or confirmed Ebola virus infection, health-care workers should apply, in addition to standard precautions, other infection control measures to avoid any exposure to patients\u2019 blood and body fluids and with possibly contaminated environments. \n\nPreparation for burial of the bodies of persons who have died from Ebola virus disease also carries high risks of transmission of the virus. Those who have died from the disease should be promptly and safely buried.\nWHO\u2019s response\n\nIn coordination with national and regional authorities and technical partners, WHO has deployed experts to help assess and control the situation. Isolation facilities and a mobile laboratory have been established; infection prevention and control and clinical management guidance is being provided; and awareness and education campaigns, social mobilization, and risk communications activities are taking place throughout the affected areas. \n\nAnyone who has stayed in areas where EVD cases have recently been reported should be aware of the symptoms of infection and seek medical attention at the first sign of illness. \n\nClinicians managing returning travellers from visiting these areas with compatible symptoms are advised to take into consideration the possibility of EVD. Malaria, typhoid fever, shigellosis, cholera, leptospirosis, plague, rickettsiosis, relapsing fever, meningitis, hepatitis and other viral haemorrhagic fevers are differential diagnosis to consider in these patients. \n\nWHO encourages countries to strengthen surveillance, including surveillance for illness compatible with EVD, and to carefully review any unusual patterns, in order to ensure identification and reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005), and encourages countries to continue national health preparedness actions.\n\nWHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied with respect to this event.",

Case investigation and contact tracing are continuing, with 375 contacts under medical follow-up at present.\n\nThe Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW) of Liberia has reported that the number of suspected and confirmed cases (8 cases) is unchanged since 31 March, with the exception of one additional death in this group (5 deaths). The number of laboratory confirmed cases remains at 2; both patients are from Lofa County, one of whom has died. On 31 March, the MOHSW issued a press release reporting that one of the laboratory confirmed cases travelled from Foyah, Lofa Country, to Monrovia, Montserrado Country, and also to Margibi County. She is currently in isolation and her contacts, including the taxi driver who transported her from Foyah to Monrovia and his family, are under medical observation.\n\nA national team headed by the Chief Medical Officer of Liberia visited Lofa County on 1 April to hold meetings with local government officials and other stakeholders in Voinjama and Foyah cities. Information and education materials on the EVD and its prevention have been distributed and national information hotlines have been established for public inquiries. \n\nOther ongoing efforts include coordination meeting at national and county levels, distribution of personal protective equipment (PPE) to hospitals in Montserrado, deployment of response teams to Nimba and Bong Counties to support county efforts, clinician training in case identification, clinical management and infection prevention and control, and social mobilisation to raise community awareness about the disease, the risk of ebolavirus transmission from human and animal sources, and its prevention including the importance of hand washing, food safety, personal protection when caring for the sick, safe burial practices and environmental hygiene. \n\nThere has been no change in the situation in Sierra Leone following the deaths of 2 probable cases of EVD in one family who died in Guinea and their bodies repatriated to Sierra Leone. As this is a rapidly changing situation, the number of reported cases and deaths, contacts under medical observation and the number of laboratory results are subject to change due to enhanced surveillance and contact tracing activities, ongoing laboratory investigations and consolidation of case, contact and laboratory data.\n\nWHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event. \n\n\nThis update has also been posted on the regional website of the WHO African Regional Office",

        "Description of the Situation": "Disease Outbreak News\n\n \n1 April 2014 -\nIn this update and subsequent ones, the terminology Ebola haemorrhagic fever will be replaced by Ebola virus disease (EVD) in line with the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). Therefore, this report provides an update on Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. \n\nAs at 31 March 2014, the Ministry of Health of Guinea has reported 122 clinically compatible cases of EVD, of which 24 are laboratory confirmed by PCR, and 98 are probable (78) or suspected (22) cases. This total number includes 80 deaths, of which 13 (16%) have been laboratory confirmed for EVD and the remaining 67 are considered as probable cases of EVD. These figures correspond to 19 new clinical cases and 14 new deaths since the 28 March. As of 30 March, 20 patients remain in isolation. Eleven health-care workers are among the probable and suspected cases. Cases have been reported from Conakry (11), Guekedou (77), Macenta (23), Kissidougou (8), and 3 from Dabola and Djingaraye combined. \n\nCase investigation and contact tracing are continuing, with 400 contacts under medical follow-up at present. Further strengthening of infection prevention and control in health-care facilities is a priority intervention. In addition, efforts are continuing to raise awareness in the community about the importance of personal protective measures to prevent ebolavirus transmission including hand washing, caring for the sick safely in the community, the use of personal protective equipment when handling potentially contaminated blood and body fluids and during environmental cleaning and disinfection, and safe burials.\n\nThe Ministry of Health of Liberia has reported 8 clinically compatible cases of EVD, including 2 laboratory-confirmed cases, from 14 to 30 March. The 2 confirmed cases were reported from Lofa County. Two patients died; one of the deceased patients has been laboratory confirmed and the other death was in a probable case. Contact tracing is underway.\n\nResponse activities in Liberia include a press conference by the Ministries of Health & Social Welfare and Ministry of Information, distribution of EVD prevention and control guidelines to health-care workers, training staff on case detection, contact tracing and follow up, clinical case management, infection prevention and control, specimen collection, handling and transportation and the safe handling of deceased patients. Staff from the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare and WHO have travelled to Lofa County to provide technical support and coordinate control efforts.\n\nClinical specimens from suspected cases are being sent to the laboratory in Conakry, Guinea, for testing. Intensive community awareness raising campaigns are also underway through the mass media, via social mobilization activities and interpersonal communications, and involvement of telephone service providers in sending text messages. \n\nThe Ministry of Health of Sierra Leone is maintaining a high level of vigilance following the deaths of 2 probable cases of EVD in one family who died in Guinea and their bodies repatriated to Sierra Leone. To date, active surveillance activities have identified no new suspected cases and all contacts of the deceased have remained well.\n\nAs this is a rapidly changing situation, the number of reported cases and deaths, contacts under medical observation and the number of laboratory results are subject to change due to enhanced surveillance and contact tracing activities, ongoing laboratory investigations and consolidation of case, contact and laboratory data.\n\nWHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event. \n\nThe risk of infection for travellers is very low since most human infections result from direct contact with the body fluids or secretions of infected patients, particularly in hospitals (nosocomial transmission) and as a result of unsafe procedures, use of contaminated medical devices (including needles and syringes) and unprotected exposure to contaminated body fluids. Travellers should avoid all contact with infected patients. Those who are providing medical care or are involved in the evaluation of an outbreak should wear protective clothing, including masks, gloves, gowns, eye protection and practice proper infection prevention and control and measures.\n\nAnyone who has stayed in the areas where EVD cases have been recently reported should be aware of the symptoms of infection and seek medical attention at the first sign of illness. Clinicians managing returning travellers from visiting these areas with compatible symptoms are advised to take into consideration the possibility of EVD. Malaria, typhoid fever, shigellosis, cholera, leptospirosis, plague, rickettsiosis, relapsing fever, meningitis, hepatitis and other viral haemorrhagic fevers are differential diagnosis to consider in these patients.\n\n\nThis update has also been posted on the regional website of the WHO African Regional Office",

        "Description of the Situation": "Disease Outbreak News\n\n \n30 March 2014 -\nThe Ministry of Health (MoH) of Liberia has provided updated details on the suspected and confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Liberia. As of 29 March, seven clinical samples, all from adult patients from Foya district, Lofa County, have been tested by PCR using Ebola Zaire virus primers by the mobile laboratory of the Institut Pasteur (IP) Dakar in Conakry. Two of those samples have tested positive for the ebolavirus. There have been 2 deaths among the suspected cases; a 35 year-old woman who died on 21 March tested positive for ebolavirus while a male patient who died on 27 March tested negative. Foya remains the only district in Liberia that has reported confirmed or suspected cases of EHF. As of 26 March, Liberia had 27 contacts under medical follow-up. \n\nIn accordance with the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005), the MoH of Liberia is communicating regularly with WHO and neighbouring countries to help coordinate and harmonise surveillance, prevention and control activities. \n\nResponse activities within health care facilities include strengthening infection prevention and control (IPC) at the Foya Hospital, the provision of additional personal preventive equipment (PPE) and medical supplies to support case isolation and clinical management and training for health care workers in IPC. Health-care workers are receiving training on EHF; 50 clinicians from 5 hospitals in Montserrado County received training on 27 March. PPE and medical supplies have also been sent to Bong and Nimba Counties which border Guinea.\n\nAs this is a rapidly changing situation, the number of reported cases and deaths, contacts under medical observation and the number of laboratory results are subject to change due to enhanced surveillance and contact tracing activities, ongoing laboratory investigations and consolidation of case, contact and laboratory data.\n\nLiberia has established a high level National Task Force to lead the response. Response partners include WHO, the International Red Cross (IRC), Samaritan\u2019s Purse (SP) Liberia, Pentecostal Mission Unlimited (PMU)-Liberia, CHF-WASH Liberia, PLAN-Liberia, UNFPA and UNICEF. \n\nThe IRC is supporting awareness campaigns among health-care workers in a number of districts in Lofa County, and is working with PMU-Liberia and SP Liberia to provide PPE to 41 health facilities including 37 clinics, 3 health centres and the Curran Lutheran Hospital. Samaritan\u2019s Purse is also providing logistics for the movement of response personnel medical supplies and fuel.\n\nCHF-WASH Liberia, PLAN-Liberia, UNFPA and UNICEF are supporting the MoH in social mobilisation activities to raise community awareness about EHF and promote risk reduction measures. \n\nWHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Liberia, Guinea or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event.\n\n\nThis update has also been posted on the regional website of the WHO African Regional Office",

        "Description of the Situation": "Disease outbreak news \n\n \n28 March 2014 -\nOn 27 March 2014, the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) of China notified WHO of an additional laboratory-confirmed case of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus.\n\nDetails of the case reported to WHO are as follows:\n\nA 55 year-old woman from Huizhou City, Guangdong Province. She became ill on 16 March and was admitted to hospital on 23 March. She is currently in a critical condition. The patient had a history of exposure to poultry. \n\n \n\nThe Chinese Government has taken the following surveillance and control measures:\n\n\nstrengthen surveillance and situation analysis;\nreinforce case management and treatment; and\nconduct risk communication with the public and release information.\n\nCurrent risk assessment\n\nThe overall risk assessment has not changed (see WHO Risk Assessment under 'Related links').\n\nThe previous report of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus detection in live poultry exported from mainland China to Hong Kong SAR shows the potential for the virus to spread through movement of live poultry, at this time there is no indication that international spread of avian influenza A(H7N9) has occurred. However as the virus infection does not cause signs of disease in poultry, continued surveillance is needed. \n\nFurther sporadic human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) infection are expected in affected and possibly neighbouring areas.\n\nShould human cases from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during or after arrival. If this were to occur, community level spread is unlikely as the virus does not have the ability to transmit easily among humans. Until the virus adapts itself for efficient human-to-human transmission, the risk of ongoing international spread of H7N9 virus by travellers is low. \nWHO advice\n\nWHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid poultry farms, or contact with animals in live bird markets, or entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travellers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.\n\nWHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. \n\nAs always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.\n\nWHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, in order to ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005), and continue national health preparedness actions.",

        "Description of the Situation": "Disease Outbreak News\n\n \n27 March 2014 -\nOn 20 and 21 March 2014, the Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia announced an additional six laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).\n\nDetails of the cases provided to WHO are as follows:\n\nA 71 year-old man from the Riyadh region with underlying medical conditions. He became ill on 24 February and was admitted to hospital on 5 March. He is currently in a critical condition. The patient had a history of exposure to animals, including camels.\n\nA 66 year-old man from the Riyadh region with underlying medical conditions. He became ill on 9 March and was admitted to hospital on 11 March. He is currently in a critical condition. The patient had no history of exposure to animals.\nAn 86 year-old man from the Riyadh region. He became ill on 11 March and passed away on 19 March. He had no history of exposure to animals.\nA 75 year-old man from the Riyadh region with underlying medical conditions. He became ill on 23 February and was admitted to hospital on 26 February. He is currently in a critical condition. The patient has a history of exposure to animals, including camels.\nA 56 year-old man from the Riyadh region with underlying medical conditions.

He became ill on 5 March and was admitted to hospital on 15 March. He is currently in a critical condition. The patient has no history of exposure to animals.\n\n \n\nGlobally, from September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of a total of 206 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 86 deaths.\nWHO advice\n\nBased on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.\n\nInfection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. Health-care facilities that provide for patients suspected or confirmed to be infected with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus from an infected patient to other patients, health-care workers and visitors. Health care workers should be educated, trained and refreshed with skills on infection prevention and control.\n\nIt is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because some have mild or unusual symptoms. For this reason, it is important that health-care workers apply standard precautions consistently with all patients \u2013 regardless of their diagnosis \u2013 in all work practices all the time.\n\nDroplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to all patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection. Contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection. Airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures. \n\nPatients should be managed as potentially infected when the clinical and epidemiological clues strongly suggest MERS-CoV, even if an initial test on a nasopharyngeal swab is negative. Repeat testing should be done when the initial testing is negative, preferably on specimens from the lower respiratory tract.\n\nHealth-care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations. All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.\n\nPeople at high risk of severe disease due to MERS-CoV should avoid close contact with animals when visiting farms or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. For the general public, when visiting a farm or a barn, general hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals, avoiding contact with sick animals, and following food hygiene practices, should be adhered to.\n\nWHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.",

        "Description of the Situation": "Disease Outbreak News\n\n \n27 March 2014 -\nThe Ministry of Health of Guinea has today reported 4 laboratory confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in the capital, Conakry. In addition, a fifth suspected case died without laboratory confirmation. Intensive case investigations are underway to identify the source and route of these patients\u2019 infection, record their travel histories before arrival in Conakry and determine their period of infectivity for the purposes of contact tracing. Rapid Response Teams are carrying out these investigations and sensitizing health care workers and the affected communities about EHF to reduce the risk of further transmission.\n\nThe total number of suspected and confirmed cases in the on-going EHF outbreak in Guinea has increased to 103, including 66 deaths. Today 15 new suspected cases were reported in Guinea (8 in Guekedou and 2 in Macenta, in addition to the 5 cases in Conakry). The case fatality rate (CFR) is 64%. All age groups have been affected but most of the cases are adults aged 15-59 years. Four health care workers are among the deaths attributed to the Ebola outbreak. As this is a rapidly changing situation, the number of reported cases and deaths are preliminary and subject to change due to enhanced surveillance activities and laboratory testing of cases.\n\nSince the beginning of the outbreak, most of the cases have been reported in three districts in south east Guinea (Guekedou, Macenta, and Kissidougou districts). Contact tracing and follow up continues in these areas.\n\nTo date, 15 cases have tested positive by PCR testing for the ebolavirus, confirmed by collaborating laboratories including the Institut Pasteur Lyon, France, Institut Pasteur (IP) Dakar, Senegal and Bernhard-Nocht Institute of Tropical Medicine Hamburg, Germany. Laboratories studies demonstrated that Zaire ebolavirus is the virus responsible for the outbreak.\n\nThe number of laboratory confirmed cases is subject to change as the laboratory results from the participating laboratories are still being consolidated and new samples are being tested.\n\nWHO has alerted countries bordering Guinea about the outbreak and to heighten surveillance for illness consistent with a viral haemorrhagic fever, especially along land borders. Both Sierra Leone and Liberia have reported suspected cases and deaths consistent with EHF to WHO among people who had travelled to Guinea before symptom onset. To date, WHO has received no reports of viral haemorrhagic fever from either country in individuals who have not travelled to Guinea. The three countries are sharing information with each other and with WHO daily. Liberia has reported 8 suspected cases of EHF, including 6 deaths, with travel histories to Guekedou district. Sierra Leone has reported 6 suspected cases, including 5 deaths. Investigations into these suspected cases are on-going.\n\nThe MOH together with WHO and other partners continues to implement measures to control the outbreak and prevent further spread. As part of the international response to the outbreak, WHO and the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) have deployed experts deployed to support Guinea in the following areas: outbreak coordination, clinical case management, surveillance and epidemiology, diagnostics, infection prevention and control, social mobilisation outbreak logistics and medical anthropology. Training health and community workers to detect, notify and manage suspected and confirmed cases and in measures to strengthen infection prevention and control, including the safe burial of the deceased, are priority interventions.\n\nThe Emerging and Dangerous Pathogens Laboratory Network (EDPLN) is working with national laboratories in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia to ensure access to laboratory testing of suspected cases and for supplementary testing.\n\nWHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event.\n\n\nThis update has also been posted on the regional website of the WHO African Regional Office",

        "Description of the Situation": "Ongoing transmission in the Syrian Arab Republic with international spread \n Disease outbreak news \n\n \n21 March 2014 -\nPolio outbreak response in the Middle East is continuing to urgently stop an outbreak affecting the region.\n\nAs of 20 March 2014, in the Syrian Arab Republic a total of 37 WPV1 cases have been reported: 25 cases by the Syrian Arab Republic Ministry of Health, and 12 cases from contested areas (Aleppo, Edleb and Deir Al Zour) not yet reflected in official figures. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on 17 December 2013, from Edleb.\n\nFurther evidence of regional spread was confirmed this week by notification of a WPV1 case from Iraq, the first polio case in the country since 2000. The case, a six-month old boy from Baghdad who had not been immunized, developed paralysis on 10 February 2014. Genetic sequencing indicates the virus is most closely related to virus detected in the Syrian Arab Republic. WPV1 was also isolated from the child\u2019s three-year old sister, who did not develop symptoms. Prospects for rapidly controlling this event are positive, as Iraq has been part of a regional Middle East emergency outbreak response since confirmation of polio in the Syrian Arab Republic was received in October 2013. In response, all countries of the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region, in a joint resolution, declared polio eradication to be an emergency, calling for support in negotiating and establishing access to those children who are currently unreached with polio vaccination.\n\nIn Iraq, since October, two nationwide immunization campaigns and three subnational campaigns have been conducted, achieving overall high quality. Approximately 95% of children were reported to have been reached during each campaign, though coverage has varied by area. WHO and UNICEF estimates from 2012 put routine immunization levels in Iraq at 70%. Routine immunization levels in Baghdad are estimated to be 81%.\n\nAs part of outbreak response, efforts have been ongoing to strengthen subnational surveillance sensitivity to ascertain the full extent of transmission, particularly in the Syrian Arab Republic. Subnational surveillance gaps persist, particularly in areas of Damascus, Aleppo, Homs, Lattakia, Quneitra and Al Raqa. Surveillance quality has improved in other governorates of north-eastern Syrian Arab Republic, including in Deir Al Zour.\n\nPhase 1 of the planned regional outbreak response is now being completed. Since October 2013, 24 supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) have been conducted across the region to reach more than 22 million children with multiple doses, in:\u3000\n\nEgypt (2 nationwide SIAs; 1 subnational SIA); \nIraq (2 nationwide SIAs; 3 subnational SIAs); \nJordan (3 nationwide SIAs); \nLebanon (3 nationwide SIAs); \nSyria (5 nationwide SIAs); \nTurkey (3 subnational SIAs); and \nWest Bank and Gaza Strip (2 SIAs).\u3000\n\n\nPhase 2 is being launched on 1 April 2014, with nationwide campaigns in: Egypt (1-3 April); Syrian Arab Republic and Iraq (both on 6-10 April) and Lebanon (April), to be followed by further campaigns across the region in May.\n\nIn Israel, WPV1-positive samples continue to be detected through environmental surveillance. In total, 186 positive samples have been collected since 3 February 2013, the most recent of which on 16 February 2014. In West Bank and Gaza Strip 3 WPV1-positive samples have been detected by environmental surveillance, the most recent of which was detected in January 2014. No cases of polio paralysis have been detected in Israel, West Bank or Gaza Strip; WPV1 has been isolated from sewage samples only.\n\nA surveillance alert remains in place for the region, calling on countries to actively search for additional potential cases in addition to implementing the recommended SIAs with OPV. The risk of further international spread across the region remains high. WHO\u2019s International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to and from polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio.",

        "Description of the Situation": "Disease Outbreak News\n\n \n20 March 2014 -\nOn 18 March 2014, WHO was notified of an additional two laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). One case was notified by the National IHR Focal Point of Kuwait and the other by the National IHR Focal Point of the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\n\nDetails of the case notified from Kuwait are as follows:\n\nA 60 year-old Syrian national who was admitted to a hospital in Kuwait on 13 February and died on 6 March. He had underlying health conditions. The patient was confirmed with MERS-CoV on 9 March. All close contacts of the patients are being followed up. \n\nDetails of the case notified from the UAE are as follows:\n\nA 68 year-old man from Abu Dhabi with underlying health conditions. He became ill on 7 March, was admitted to a hospital on 11 March with injury to his finger. He has mild symptoms. The patient was laboratory-confirmed with MERS-CoV on 17 March. The patient returned from Saudi Arabia five days prior to his admission in the hospital. He frequently visits Saudi Arabia where he owns a camel farm. Public health authorities are carrying out contact tracing and epidemiological investigations. \n\n \n\nGlobally, from September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of a total of 198 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 84 deaths.\nWHO advice\n\nBased on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.\n\nInfection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. Health-care facilities that provide for patients suspected or confirmed to be infected with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus from an infected patient to other patients, health-care workers and visitors. Health care workers should be educated, trained and refreshed with skills on infection prevention and control.\n\nIt is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because some have mild or unusual symptoms. For this reason, it is important that health-care workers apply standard precautions consistently with all patients \u2013 regardless of their diagnosis \u2013 in all work practices all the time.\n\nDroplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to all patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection. Contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection. Airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures. \n\nPatients should be managed as potentially infected when the clinical and epidemiological clues strongly suggest MERS-CoV, even if an initial test on a nasopharyngeal swab is negative. Repeat testing should be done when the initial testing is negative, preferably on specimens from the lower respiratory tract.\n\nHealth-care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations. All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.\n\nPeople at high risk of severe disease due to MERS-CoV should avoid close contact with animals when visiting farms or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. For the general public, when visiting a farm or a barn, general hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals, avoiding contact with sick animals, and following food hygiene practices, should be adhered to.\n\nWHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.",

However as the virus infection does not cause signs of disease in poultry, continued surveillance is needed. \n\nFurther sporadic human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) infection are expected in affected and possibly neighbouring areas.\n\nShould human cases from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during or after arrival. If this were to occur, community level spread is unlikely as the virus does not have the ability to transmit easily among humans. Until the virus adapts itself for efficient human-to-human transmission, the risk of ongoing international spread of H7N9 virus by travellers is low. \nWHO advice\n\nWHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid poultry farms, or contact with animals in live bird markets, or entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travellers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.\n\nWHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. \n\nAs always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.\n\nWHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, in order to ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005), and continue national health preparedness actions.",

In total, seven WPV1 cases have now been reported from West, North West, Centre and Adamaoua Regions, with onset of paralysis ranging from 1 October 2013 to 31 January 2014. Genetic sequencing of WPV1 isolates suggests prolonged undetected circulation of poliovirus. Due to continued poliovirus circulation in Cameroon, gaps in surveillance, and influx of vulnerable refugee populations from Central African Republic, WHO is elevating the risk assessment of international spread of polio from Cameroon to very high. \n\nFollowing confirmation of the outbreak in October 2013, Cameroon conducted three nationwide immunization campaigns with a fourth nationwide activity starting on 9 March 2014. Even though independent monitoring suggests some improvements, serious gaps in quality remain (both in implementation and monitoring) which must be urgently addressed. Quality varies greatly by region. The main reason for non-vaccination of children is that houses had not been visited (43% of non-vaccinated children). Analysis of overall population immunity (non-polio acute flaccid paralysis data 6-59 months) suggests upwards of 40% of children remain under-immunized (with 30% having received zero doses of oral polio vaccine \u2013 OPV). The continuation and expanding spread of transmission indicates serious gaps in quality of outbreak response. \n\nThe confirmation of new cases has resulted in planning additional emergency outbreak response activities, including converting a subnational immunization campaign to a full nationwide activity in April 2014, and implementing nationwide campaigns in May and June 2014. Critical to success will be to ensure substantial improvement in the quality campaigns that reach all children multiple times with OPV. Equally important will be efforts to rapidly improve the quality of surveillance so that the full extent of the outbreak can be determined and tracked. \n\nIt is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis cases in order to rapidly detect any new virus importations and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction.\n\nWHO\u2019s International Travel and Health recommends that all travelers to and from polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio.\n\n\nWHO\u2019s International travel and health",

        "Description of the Situation": "Disease outbreak news\n\n \n12 March 2014 -\nWHO has been informed of an additional three laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. One case was reported from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on 11 March and two cases from Saudi Arabia on 5 March. \n\nDetails of the case reported by the UAE are as follows:\n\nThe patient is a 68 year-old man from Abu Dhabi, UAE. He became ill on 1 March, was admitted to a hospital on 3 March and is currently in a stable condition. The patient has underlying medical conditions. He had no contact with other known MERS-CoV cases and had no travel history. The patient owns a farm that he visits daily, and where he had contact with animals, including camels which he breeds. \n\nDetails of the cases reported by the Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia are as follows: \n\nA 51 year-old man from Riyadh region with underlying medical conditions. He became ill on 28 February and was hospitalised on 2 March. He is reported to have had exposure with animals.\nA 55 year-old man from Riyadh region with underlying medical conditions. He became ill on 17 February and was hospitalized on 25 February and died on 3 March. *\n\n \n\nGlobally, from September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of a total of 189 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 82 deaths.\nWHO advice\n\nBased on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.\n\nInfection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. Health-care facilities that provide for patients suspected or confirmed to be infected with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus from an infected patient to other patients, health-care workers and visitors. Health care workers should be educated, trained and refreshed with skills on infection prevention and control.\n\nIt is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because some have mild or unusual symptoms. For this reason, it is important that health-care workers apply standard precautions consistently with all patients \u2013 regardless of their diagnosis \u2013 in all work practices all the time.\n\nDroplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to all patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection. Contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection. Airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures. \n\nPatients should be managed as potentially infected when the clinical and epidemiological clues strongly suggest MERS-CoV, even if an initial test on a nasopharyngeal swab is negative. Repeat testing should be done when the initial testing is negative, preferably on specimens from the lower respiratory tract.\n\nHealth-care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations.\nAll Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.\n\nPeople at high risk of severe disease due to MERS-CoV should avoid close contact with animals when visiting farms or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. For the general public, when visiting a farm or a barn, general hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals, avoiding contact with sick animals, and following food hygiene practices, should be adhered to.\n\nWHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.\n\n\n* It was incorrectly stated in an earlier version of this DON that the patient was a 56 year-old woman.",

        "Description of the Situation": "Disease Outbreak News\n\n \n28 February 2014 -\nOn 3 and 15 February 2014, the Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia announced two additional laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection.\n\nDetails of the cases provided to WHO are as follows:\n\nA 22-year-old man from the Eastern Region. He became ill on 3 February and was hospitalised on 9 February and died on 12 February 2014. The patient had an underlying medical condition. He had no reported history of contact with animals or a previously laboratory-confirmed case. \nA 67-year-old man from Riyadh. He became ill on 23 January and was hospitalised on 25 January. The patient had an underlying medical condition. He had no reported history of contact with animals or with a previously laboratory-confirmed case.\n\n \n\nGlobally, from September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of a total of 184 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 80 deaths. \nInfection prevention and control measures\n\nBased on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.\n\nMERS-CoV infections that may be acquired in health-care facilities illustrate the need to continue to strengthen infection prevention and control measures. Health-care facilities that provide care for patients suspected or confirmed with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus to other patients, health-care workers and visitors. Education and training for infection prevention and control should be provided to all health-care workers and regularly refreshed.\n\nEarly identification of the MERS-CoV is important, but not all the cases could be reliably and timely detected, especially when disease is mild or presents atypically. Therefore, it is important to ensure that standard precautions are consistently used for all patients and all work practices all of the time, regardless of suspected or confirmed infection with the MERS-CoV or any other pathogen. Droplet precautions should be added when providing care to all patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection, and contact precautions plus eye protection should be added when caring for confirmed or probable cases of MERS-CoV infection. Airborne precautions are indicated when performing aerosol generating procedures. \n\nWhen the clinical and epidemiological clues strongly suggest MERS-CoV, the patient should be managed as potentially infected, even if an initial test on a nasopharyngeal swab is negative. Repeat testing should be done when the initial testing is negative, preferably on specimens from the lower respiratory tract.\nWHO advice\n\nWHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.\n\nHealth-care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations.\n\nAll Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.\n\nPeople at high risk of severe disease due to MERS-CoV should avoid close contact with animals when visiting farms or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. For the general public, when visiting a farm or a barn, general hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals, avoiding contact with sick animals, and following food hygiene practices, should be adhered to.\n\nWHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.",

        "Description of the Situation": "Disease outbreak news\n\n \n7 February 2014 -\nOn 3 February 2014, United Arab Emirates (UAE) notified WHO of an additional laboratory-confirmed case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection.\n\nThe case is a 66 year-old male UAE national, residing in Abu Dhabi. He had onset of symptoms on 20 January 2014 with an upper respiratory tract illness and was admitted to hospital on 24 January 2014 with pneumonia and renal failure. He had underlying medical conditions.\nMERS-CoV was laboratory-confirmed at the national laboratory in Abu Dhabi on the 30 January 2014 by two positive PCR targets. The patient is currently in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in stable condition. Public health authorities are carrying out contact tracing and an epidemiological investigation. \nThe patient owns camels in UAE and has recent travel history to Oman from 20 January 2014 where he had contact with camels. \n \n\nGlobally, from September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of a total of 182 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 79 deaths.\nInfection prevention and control measures\n\nBased on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.\n\nMERS-CoV infections that may be acquired in health-care facilities illustrate the need to continue to strengthen infection prevention and control measures. Health-care facilities that provide care for patients suspected or confirmed with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus to other patients, health-care workers and visitors. Education and training for infection prevention and control should be provided to all health-care workers and regularly refreshed.\n\nEarly identification of the MERS-CoV is important, but not all the cases could be reliably and timely detected, especially when disease is mild or presents atypically. Therefore, it is important to ensure that standard precautions are consistently used for all patients and all work practices all of the time, regardless of suspected or confirmed infection with the MERS-CoV or any other pathogen. Droplet precautions should be added when providing care to all patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection, and contact precautions plus eye protection should be added when caring for confirmed or probable cases of MERS-CoV infection. Airborne precautions are indicated when performing aerosol generating procedures. \n\nWhen the clinical and epidemiological clues strongly suggest MERS-CoV, the patient should be managed as potentially infected, even if an initial test on a nasopharyngeal swab is negative. Repeat testing should be done when the initial testing is negative, preferably on specimens from the lower respiratory tract.\nWHO advice\n\nWHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.\n\nHealth-care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations.\n\nAll Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.\n\nPeople at high risk of severe disease due to MERS-CoV should avoid close contact with animals when visiting farms or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. For the general public, when visiting a farm or a barn, general hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals, avoiding contact with sick animals, and following food hygiene practices, should be adhered to.\n\nWHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.",

        "Description of the Situation": "Disease outbreak news\n\n \n27 January 2014 -\nWHO has been notified of two additional laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).\n\nDetails of the cases are as follows: \n\nWHO was notified of one case by the Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia. The case is a 54 year old man from Riyadh who developed respiratory illness symptoms on 29 December, 2013 and was hospitalized on 4 January, 2014. The patient received medical treatment in an intensive care unit. He died on 14 January 2014. Samples tested positive for MERS-CoV after his death. The patient was a health care worker. He had a history of chronic disease and had no history of contacts with animals or contact with known cases of MERS-CoV. In addition, he had no travel history. The investigation is ongoing.\nWHO was notified of one case by the Ministry of Health of Jordan on 23 January, 2014. The case is a 48 year old man who became ill on 31 December, 2013 and developed fever, dry cough, difficulty in breathing, abdominal pain and vomiting, and was admitted to a hospital on 9 January, 2014. While there, his condition worsened and on 16 January he was placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient died on 23 January. A sample taken from the patient on 21 January tested positive by PCR for MERS-CoV. The patient had underlying health conditions and he had travelled to the United Kingdom from 12 November to 25 December 2013 seeking treatment for his underlying conditions. The patient had no history of animal contact and is believed to have not attended any large social events in the last 30 days. It is reported that he had received 2 guests from Kuwait between 25 December and 31 December, 2013. National authorities in Jordan are following family contacts, medical staff and health workers, in addition to strictly applying infection control measures. Further investigations are ongoing in Jordan and UK. \n\n\nGlobally, from September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of a total of 180 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 77 deaths.\n\nMERS-CoV infections that may be acquired in health care facilities illustrate the need to continue to strengthen infection prevention and control measures. Health care facilities that provide care for patients suspected or confirmed with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus to other patients, health care workers and visitors. Education and training for infection prevention and control should be provided to all health care workers and regularly refreshed.\n\nEarly identification of the MERS-CoV is important, but not all the cases could be reliably and timely detected, especially when disease is mild or presents atypically. Therefore, it is important to ensure that standard precautions are consistently used for all patients and all work practices all of the time, regardless of suspected or confirmed infection with the MERS-CoV or any other pathogen. Droplet precautions should be added when providing care to all patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection, and contact precautions plus eye protection should be added when caring for confirmed or probable cases of MERS-CoV infection. Airborne precautions are indicated when performing aerosol generating procedures.\n\nWhen the clinical and epidemiological clues strongly suggest MERS-CoV, the patient should be managed as potentially infected, even if an initial test on a nasopharyngeal swab is negative. Repeat testing should be done when the initial testing is negative, preferably on specimens from the lower respiratory tract.\n\nWHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.\n\nHealth care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations.\n\nAll Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.\n\nPeople at high risk of severe disease due to MERS-CoV should avoid close contact with animals when visiting farms or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. For the general public, when visiting a farm or a barn, general hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals, avoiding contact with sick animals, and following food hygiene practices, should be adhered to.\n\nWHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.",

        "Description of the Situation": "Disease outbreak news\n\n \n7 February 2014 -\nOn 3 February 2014, United Arab Emirates (UAE) notified WHO of an additional laboratory-confirmed case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection.\n\nThe case is a 66 year-old male UAE national, residing in Abu Dhabi. He had onset of symptoms on 20 January 2014 with an upper respiratory tract illness and was admitted to hospital on 24 January 2014 with pneumonia and renal failure. He had underlying medical conditions.\nMERS-CoV was laboratory-confirmed at the national laboratory in Abu Dhabi on the 30 January 2014 by two positive PCR targets. The patient is currently in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in stable condition. Public health authorities are carrying out contact tracing and an epidemiological investigation. \nThe patient owns camels in UAE and has recent travel history to Oman from 20 January 2014 where he had contact with camels. \n \n\nGlobally, from September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of a total of 182 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 79 deaths.\nInfection prevention and control measures\n\nBased on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.\n\nMERS-CoV infections that may be acquired in health-care facilities illustrate the need to continue to strengthen infection prevention and control measures. Health-care facilities that provide care for patients suspected or confirmed with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus to other patients, health-care workers and visitors. Education and training for infection prevention and control should be provided to all health-care workers and regularly refreshed.\n\nEarly identification of the MERS-CoV is important, but not all the cases could be reliably and timely detected, especially when disease is mild or presents atypically. Therefore, it is important to ensure that standard precautions are consistently used for all patients and all work practices all of the time, regardless of suspected or confirmed infection with the MERS-CoV or any other pathogen. Droplet precautions should be added when providing care to all patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection, and contact precautions plus eye protection should be added when caring for confirmed or probable cases of MERS-CoV infection. Airborne precautions are indicated when performing aerosol generating procedures. \n\nWhen the clinical and epidemiological clues strongly suggest MERS-CoV, the patient should be managed as potentially infected, even if an initial test on a nasopharyngeal swab is negative. Repeat testing should be done when the initial testing is negative, preferably on specimens from the lower respiratory tract.\nWHO advice\n\nWHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.\n\nHealth-care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations.\n\nAll Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.\n\nPeople at high risk of severe disease due to MERS-CoV should avoid close contact with animals when visiting farms or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. For the general public, when visiting a farm or a barn, general hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals, avoiding contact with sick animals, and following food hygiene practices, should be adhered to.\n\nWHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.",
