        "Description of the Situation": "17 May 2001 Disease Outbreak Reported\n\n\n\nInfluenza A(H5N1) virus was recently detected in three retail\nlive-bird markets in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, with increased\nmortality in the bird population noted in the last few days.\u00a0 No H5N1 viruses were\nisolated in other retail markets.\u00a0 No human\ncases of H5N1 virus have been detected.\u00a0 The strains isolated from the birds differ\ngenetically from the H5N1 virus which caused human disease in 1997.\u00a0 There is no\ncause for public health concern, but as a precautionary measure, the birds at all three\nretail markets have been destroyed and the markets cleansed and disinfected.\nFor further information, click on the website of the\nGovernment of Hong Kong\nSpecial Administrative Region of China.\n\nThe following is the transcript of the\nEnglish portion of the opening remarks made by Mrs Lily Yam, the Secretary for the\nEnvironment and Food, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, at a press\nbriefing held on May 16:\nPrecautionary measures taken to prevent\nspread of chicken disease\nI have called this press briefing to\nannounce that at 3.30 this afternoon the Director of Agriculture, Fisheries and\nConservation has issued a notice declaring the poultry stalls in three markets as infected\nplaces in accordance with the Public Health (Animals and Birds) Regulations. The three\nmarkets are Yeung Luk Road Market in Sheung Wan, Fa Yuen Street Market, and the Smithfield\nRoad Market. \nThe Food and Environmental Hygiene\nDepartment has already started action to close these poultry stalls and the department has\nrequested all poultry stallholders to destroy the live birds in their stalls, and these\nstallholders will be given every assistance and advice by members of the Food and\nEnvironmental Hygiene Department. The department has also made appropriate arrangements\nfor the destroyed birds to be sent right away to a landfill for proper treatment. After\nall the birds have been destroyed, the poultry stalls in the markets will be thoroughly\ncleansed and disinfected. \nWe have taken this precautionary measure\nfor two reasons. The first is that since yesterday, in Yeung Luk Road Market, 763 chickens\nhave died. There are also a number of chicken deaths in the other two markets. Tests by\nthe Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department have demonstrated that these\nchickens have died of avian influenza. I have to emphasize that there are many strains of\nH5N1 and according to the information currently available, only the H5N1 chicken strain\nthat we had in Hong Kong in 1997 would affect human beings, and the vast majority of H5N1\nstrains will not affect human beings.\nFrom samples we have recently collected\nfrom these three markets, a few are shown to contain the H5 virus, and genes sequencing\ntests have demonstrated that these viruses are not - I repeat not - the same as the kind\nof H5N1 chicken virus that we had in Hong Kong in 1997. Nonetheless, we feel that it is\nessential for us to take this precautionary measure because there is a need to destroy\nthese viruses thoroughly, to prevent their lingering in the market always with the\nprobability, no matter how low the possibility, that they might - they might - combine\nwith other viruses to result in a new strain which may affect human beings.\nI have to reiterate there is no cause for\npublic concern at this stage. This is a precautionary measure. The indication is that\nthere is no evidence that these viruses would affect human beings. Of course, the public\nis reminded to observe the usual hygiene standards. \nThe measures that we have taken and the\ntests that we have conducted, and the results, show that in Hong Kong we have one of the\nbest and thorough surveillance systems covering not just imported birds but also the\narrangements in our markets, and the public can rest assured that this surveillance system\nwill enable us to detect any problems as soon as they arise so that we can take the\nnecessary measures.\nThank you very much.",

        "Description of the Situation": "28 February 2001 Disease Outbreak Reported\n\n\n\n\nPRESS RELEASE\nISSUED BY WHO- 28 February 2001\nUGANDA EBOLA OUTBREAK\nOFFICIALLY OVER\nWHO calls for stronger alert\nand response to minimize the \nglobal impact of future outbreaks\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe Uganda Ebola outbreak, which was first\nreported in October 2000, is officially over. The last person to be infected by the virus\nrecovered 42 days ago, twice the maximum incubation period for Ebola to develop.\nThe international response, in support of\nthe Government of Uganda helped to break the cycle of transmission of the virus which\nkilled 224 people in Uganda, including health workers and Dr. Matthew Lukwiya, who first\nidentified the outbreak.\nMore than 20 international NGOs and\ngovernment agencies (see list below) from WHO's Global Outbreak\nAlert and Response Network worked together to combat the outbreak. In particular, the\nCentres for Disease Control and Prevention, US (CDC), Epicentre, Health Canada, Italian\nCooperation, M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), the Red Cross and UNICEF, together with\ninstitutions in Belgium, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom worked closely with the\ndoctors, nurses and staff at Gulu Hospital and Lacor Hospital, and Ugandan government\nofficials.\n\"The successful operation in Uganda\nemphasized what can be achieved when we identify epidemic threats rapidly and act together\nswiftly. Today we recognize the efforts of the people of Uganda, and the contributions and\nachievements of our partners.\" says David Heymann, Executive Director of WHO's\nCommunicable Diseases. \"Epidemic prone diseases are harmful to communities and ignore\nnational borders. We need to recognize them as threats to global health security and\ncoordinate effective international solutions.\"\nIn this regard, WHO is working to mobilize\nthe international community to strengthen epidemic alert and response and raise awareness\nof the global threat of infectious diseases. Global health security will be a top agenda\nitem at this year's World Health Assembly.\nFirst reports from Gulu District of an\nunusual severe febrile illness reached the Ugandan Ministry of Health in Kampala on 8\nOctober 2000. Even before the disease was formally identified as Ebola, the Government of\nUganda facilitated rapid access to the outbreak area and partners in WHO's Global\nOutbreak Alert and Response Network responded with technical experts, protective equipment\nand logistics support for the Outbreak Response.\nInitial laboratory confirmation was carried out by the\nNational Institute of Virology in South Africa. A field laboratory was maintained at Lacor\nHospital by CDC throughout the outbreak. This innovative measure guaranteed essential\nlaboratory services for diagnostic tests to confirm or refute Ebola infection, and for\npackaging and transport of clinical samples requiring additional investigations.\nDirect financial support to the Ebola\nAppeal was provided by Canada, ECHO, the European Commission, Ireland, Norway and Japan to\nsupplement contingency funding provided by Germany and the Netherlands. In addition, many\ndonors and agencies provided assistance directly to Uganda.\nThe mobilization of the local community in\nGulu played a pivotal role in controlling the Ebola outbreak and is central to a new\nearly-warning surveillance system for epidemic-prone diseases. Following the Ebola\nOutbreak partners in WHO's Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network and\nUganda's Ministry of Health are implementing a community-based disease surveillance\nsystem that will significantly improve people's lives and represents a potential model for\nfuture development of community-based surveillance systems.\nEbola haemorrhagic fever (EHF) is one of\nthe most virulent viral diseases known to humankind, causing death in 50-90% of all\nclinically ill cases. The virus was first identified in a western equatorial province of\nSudan and in a nearby region of Zaire (now Democratic Republic of the Congo) in 1976 after\nsignificant epidemics in Yambuku, northern Zaire, and Nzara, southern Sudan.\nIncluding the most recent outbreak, about\n1500 cases with over 1000 deaths have been documented since the virus was discovered.\nAnnex\n\nPartners in the Global Outbreak Alert and\nResponse Network that provided support and personnel to the Outbreak Response Team\nincluded: \n\nAction Contre la Faim (ACF) \n\nAfrican Medical and Research Foundation\n(AMREF-Flying Doctors) \n\nAgency for Coordination in Research and\nDevelopment (ACORD-UK) \n\nCatholic Relief Services \n\nCenters for Disease Control and\nPrevention, Atlanta, USA (CDC) \n\nEpicentre, Paris, France \n\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross\n(ICRC) \n\nInternational Federation of Red Cross and\nRed Crescent Societies (IFRC) and the Ugandan Red Cross Society \n\nHealth Canada, Ottawa, Canada \n\nInstitute of Medical Science, Tokyo,\nJapan \n\nInstitute for Tropical Medicine, Antwerp,\nBelgium \n\nInternational Rescue Committee (IRC) \n\nIstituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0 (ISS,\nItaly) \n\nItalian Cooperation, Italy \n\nM\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) (Holland\nand Belgium) \n\nNagoya City University Medical School,\nJapan \n\nNational Health Service, United Kingdom \n\nNational Institute of Infectious\nDiseases, Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan \n\nNational Institute of Virology,\nJohannesburg, South Africa \n\nPublic Health Laboratory Services, United\nKingdom \n\nSave the Children (Denmark) \n\n\nSendai Quarantine Station, Japan \n\nTropical Medicine Institute, Hamburg,\nGermany \n\nUNICEF \n\nUnited Kingdom Department for\nInternational Development (DFID) \n\nUS Agency for International Development\n(USAID) \n\nWorld Food Programme (Nairobi) \n\nWorld Health Organization \n\nWorld Vision \n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________",
