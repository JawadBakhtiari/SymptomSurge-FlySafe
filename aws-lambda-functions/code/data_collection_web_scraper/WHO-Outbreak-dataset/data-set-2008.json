        "Description of the Situation": "26 December 2008 -\nThe Ministry of Health (MoH) of the Democratic Republic of the Congo declared on 25 December an outbreak of Ebola haemorrhagic fever in Mweka District, Kasai Occidental province based on laboratory results from the Centre International de Recherches M\u00e9dicales de Franceville (CIRMF) in Gabon. CIRMF confirmed the presence of Ebola virus in 2 samples from 2 of the patients in the outbreak by antigen detection. In addition, laboratory tests conducted by Institut National de Recherches Biologiques (INRB) in Kinshasa, also confirmed the presence of Shigella. \n\nAs of 26 December, WHO is aware of 34 suspected cases including 9 deaths (CFR 26%) associated with the ongoing event. Additional samples have been collected and are en route to INRB. \n\nThe WHO Country Office, Regional Office and Headquarters are supporting the MoH in Kinshasa and in the field at the location of the outbreak. In addition, the WHO Country Office is supporting the operational costs of the investigation and response teams and has deployed four vehicles to the field. Additional staff, outbreak response equipment and supplies, including Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), are also being sent to the area. An enhanced team of national and international experts is being mobilized to implement control strategies for Ebola haemorrhagic fever and to support outbreak field response in the province.\n\nWHO is working together with laboratory partners to provide comprehensive laboratory services, and to support the MoH in the control and investigation of the outbreak. \n\nWHO is unaware of any reports signaling the international spread of disease and advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions upon the Democratic Republic of the Congo .",

        "Sitation at a Glance": "",
        "Description of the Situation": "26 December 2008 -\n As of 25 December 2008, a total of 26 497 cases, including 1 518 deaths, have been reported by the Ministry of Health in Zimbabwe. Cases are now being reported from all 10 of the country's provinces. Harare, particularly Budiriro suburb in the south west, accounts for the majority of cases, followed by Beitbridge in Matabeleland South and Mudzi in Mashonaland East. The current outbreak is the largest ever recorded in Zimbabwe and is not yet under control. In fact, the epidemiological week ending 20 December saw over 5 000 new cases - an increase in the number of weekly cases relative to previous weeks - and an increase in deaths outside treatment/health centres.\n\n\nThe overall Case Fatality Rate (CFR) has risen to 5.7% - far above the 1% which is normal in large outbreaks - and in some rural areas it has reached as high as 50%. Mortality outside of healthcare facilities remains very high. This is a clear indication that better case management and access to healthcare is needed - in particular an increased use of oral rehydration therapy with Oral Rehydration Salts in communities very early after onset of the disease. \n\nThe outbreak has taken on a subregional dimension with cases being reported from neighboring countries. In South Africa as of 26 December, 1 279 cumulative cases and 12 deaths (CFR of 0.9%) had been recorded, with the bulk of the cases (1 194) in the Limpopo area. Cases have also been reported in Botswana (Palm Tree). \n\nThe current situation is closely linked to the lack of safe drinking water, poor sanitation, declining health infrastructure, and reduced numbers of healthcare staff reporting to work. Other current risk factors include the commencement of the rainy season and the movement of people within the country, and possibly across borders, during the Christmas season.\nWHO, together with the Ministry of Health and partners from the health and Water and Sanitation clusters, has established a cholera outbreak response coordination unit in order to strengthen the reporting and early detection of cases, improve the response mechanism and access to healthcare and ensure proper case management. WHO has also deployed experts in public health, water and sanitation, logistics and social mobilization. In light of the extent and pace of expansion of the outbreak, reinforcing all control activities across the country is critical.\n\n\nGiven the current dynamic of the outbreak and the context of the collapsed health system, a cholera vaccination is not recommended. Moreover, the use of the internationally available WHO prequalified oral cholera vaccine is not recommended once an outbreak has started due to its 2-dose regimen and the time required to reach protective efficacy, high cost and the heavy logistics associated to its use. The use of the parenteral cholera vaccine has never been recommended by WHO due to its low protective efficacy and the occurrence of severe adverse events.\n\nIn controlling the spread of cholera WHO does not recommend any special restrictions to travel or trade to or from affected areas. However, neighboring countries are encouraged to reinforce their active surveillance and preparedness systems. Mass chemoprophylaxis is strongly discouraged, as it has no effect on the spread of cholera, can have adverse effects by increasing antimicrobial resistance and provides a false sense of security.",

        "Description of the Situation": "2 December 2008 -\nAs of 1 December 2008, the Ministry of Health in Zimbabwe has reported a total of 11 735 cholera cases with 484 deaths since August 2008, affecting all provinces in the country. The overall case fatality rate is 4% but has reached up to 20\u201330% in remote areas. Out of the total number of cases, 50% have been reported from Budiriro, a high density suburb of the capital city, Harare. Beitbridge, a town bordering South Africa, has reported 26% of all cases. In the last two days, two additional areas have been affected: Chegutu (in Mashonaland West province) and Mvuma (in Midlands province). Reports have also been received from the Ministries of Health in neighbouring countries confirming cholera cases have occurred in Musina (South Africa), Palm Tree (Botswana) and Guro district (Mozambique). \n\nCholera outbreaks have become more frequent in Zimbabwe since the early 1990s. However, with the exception of the large outbreaks that occurred in 1999 and 2002, the disease has been kept under control through intensified prevention and preparedness activities. \n\nCholera is mainly transmitted through contaminated water and food and is closely linked to inadequate environmental management. Recent interruptions to the water supplies, together with overcrowding, are aggravating factors in this epidemic. ZINWA (Zimbabwe National Water Authority) has pledged to correct the water supply and sewage system as a matter of urgency.\n\nThe Ministry of Health and WHO, together with its health sector partners (UNICEF, IOM, OXFAM-GB, Medecins du Monde, ICRC, ACF, MSF\u2010Spain - Holland & Luxemburg, Plan International, GOAL, Save the Children-UK and others), have established a comprehensive and coordinated cholera response operational plan to address the needs of the population in the affected areas, emphasizing a multi-sectoral response. WHO is procuring emergency stocks of supplies to meet identified gaps and is deploying a full outbreak investigation and response team, including epidemiologists, water and sanitation engineers and social mobilization specialists. In addition, an epidemiologist and three data managers from the WHO Inter-country Support Team in Harare are assisting the WHO Country Office in data monitoring, analysis and mapping.\n\nCommunities are being encouraged to protect themselves against cholera by adhering to proper food safety practices as well as to good personal hygiene. Early rehydration at home by using oral rehydration salts is paramount to diminishing mortality. \n\nMass chemoprophylaxis with antibiotics is strongly discouraged, as it has no effect on the spread of cholera, can have adverse effects by increasing antimicrobial resistance and provides a false sense of security. \n\nOnce an outbreak has started, WHO does not recommend the use of the current internationally available WHO prequalified oral cholera vaccine.

They constitute the first cholera cases detected in Iraq in 2008. By 28 August, seven cases had been laboratory confirmed, and a further 174 cases were suspected as cholera, bringing the total number of reported cases to 181 (128 in Missan and 53 in Baghdad). In the first week of September, the outbreak spread to Babil Province, south of Baghdad, where 116 suspect cases have now been identified. The presence of Vibrio cholerae, the bacterium causing the disease, has been confirmed in 21 cases. To date there have been 10 fatalities, three of whom tested positive for Vibrio cholera. \n\nThe re-emergence of cholera this year is not unexpected: in September 2007, the country was affected by a large outbreak (4696 cases with 24 deaths). The outbreak occurred mainly in northern Iraq, but sporadic cases were also detected in other provinces.\n\n\nThe Government of Iraq has mobilized a multi-sectoral response to the outbreak. Specific control measures have been reinforced and preventive measures to reduce the risk of transmission to unaffected areas have been put in place. Building on last year's experience, the Ministry of Health, together with WHO, have put in place an effective surveillance system that was able to capture the very first cases of cholera, enabling a timely response and facilitating the containment of the outbreak. \n\nHowever, the overall quality of water and sanitation remains very poor, a factor known to greatly facilitate cholera contamination. Experience has shown that long term-prevention of cholera depends on access to safe water and adequate sanitation to prevent exposure and interrupt transmission. Improving water and sanitation infrastructures is therefore a long-term goal of WHO and its partners in Iraq and, in times of outbreaks, it is essential that immediate measures, such as water treatment at household level, health education and proper case management, are implemented rapidly. To this end, the Government of Iraq is providing chlorine tablets to families and is intensifying social mobilization activities.\n\n\nIn response to a request from the Ministry of Health, WHO is providing technical support, particularly in the area of laboratory testing. A joint Ministry of Health/WHO mission will be deployed shortly.\n\nWHO does not recommend any restrictions to travel or trade to or from affected areas, as a means of controlling cholera outbreaks. Neighboring countries are encouraged, however, to reinforce their active surveillance and preparedness. \nFor more information\n\n\nPrevention and control of cholera outbreaks: WHO policy and recommendationsWHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean \n\nWHO cholera fact sheet\n\n\nCholera in Iraq - Mapjpg, 404kb",

The cases were reported in different health districts of the capital, Abidjan. One case is a 48 year old female from Cocody, who was vaccinated against yellow fever in 1997, and the second is a 20 year old male from the urban area of Treichville, who has never been vaccinated against yellow fever. \n\nThe following conclusions were drawn by the GOARN mission: (i) the epidemiological situation is that of a temporal cluster of yellow fever cases without geographic focus and without continuation at present; (ii) although a mass vaccination campaign was conducted in 2001, the actual yellow fever vaccination coverage is likely to be around or below 60%; (iii) vectors capable of transmitting yellow fever are present in Abidjan; and (iv) the entomological risk indices (Breteau index and Container index) were over the threshold in all localities investigated, indicating a high risk of yellow fever transmission.\n\nAs a result, the mission recommends that the surveillance system to detect new yellow fever cases is strengthened and that vector control measures are implemented. \n\nSubsequent to the mission, in July 2008, a further three laboratory confirmed cases were reported by the Ministry of Health. In addition to the standard IgM tests, more specific tests were used for all cases at the regional reference laboratory, Institut Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal, to determine the presence of the yellow fever virus and to exclude the presence of any other haemorrhagic fevers. \n\nTo date, the Ministry of Health has reported a total of nine suspected cases of yellow fever, including the five confirmed cases.\n\nOn the basis of these results, the Ministry of Health has decided to carry out a mass vaccination campaign in Abidjan, in August 2008, targeting 1 938 161 people. The campaign will be conducted with the technical assistance of WHO and the support of the GAVI alliance (the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization). The previous mass vaccination campaign in Abidjan took place in 2001, during which 2.6 million doses were administered.",

        "Description of the Situation": "10 July 2008\n\nWHO has been notified by the Government of the Netherlands of a case of Marburg haemorrhagic fever (MHF) in a Dutch tourist who visited Uganda. Marburg virus infection has been demonstrated by laboratory tests performed by the Bernhard Nocht Institute in Hamburg, Germany. \n\nThe 40-year-old woman travelled in Uganda from 5-28 June, 2008, and entered caves on two occasions. The first cave was visited on 16 June at Fort Portal. No bats were seen in this cave. She was reportedly exposed to fruit bats during a visit to the \u201cpython cave\u201d in the Maramagambo Forest between Queen Elisabeth Park and Kabale on 19 June. This cave is thought to harbour bat species that have been found to carry filoviruses in other locations in sub-Saharan Africa. Filoviruses cause two types of viral haemorrhagic fever: Marburg and Ebola. A large bat population was seen in the cave and the woman is reported to have had direct contact with one bat.\n\nThe woman returned to the Netherlands on 28 June in good health. The first symptoms (fever, chills) occurred on 2 July and she was admitted to hospital on 5 July. Rapid clinical deterioration with liver failure and severe haemorrhaging occurred on 7 July. The patient remains in a critical clinical condition.\n\nContact tracing and temperature monitoring have been initiated for unprotected contacts with a history of possible exposure to the case after 2 July. Although further epidemiological investigation is needed to exclude other possible sites of exposure to MHF virus, as a precaution Dutch authorities have alerted the tour operator to avoid visits to the caves until further information is available.\n\nNo citizens of other countries were involved in this trip except for a local tour guide, but the cave in the Maramagambo Forrest is known to be a tourist attraction. No measures were taken with respect to the passengers on the flight from Uganda as the flight occurred four days before the onset of symptoms in the patient.\n\nWHO has informed the Ministry of Health Uganda which will take appropriate steps nationally to investigate these events, and WHO has recommended that the MoH advise all residents and travellers to avoid entering caves with bat populations.\nFor more information\n\n\nWHO Marburg haemorrhagic fever website",

        "Description of the Situation": "23 June 2008 -\nFollowing an unexplained cluster of deaths in children from the NGagne Diaw quarter of Thiaroye sur Mer, Dakar, Senegal, an investigation by health and environmental authorities revealed that the area was contaminated with lead from the informal recycling of lead batteries. In addition, siblings and mothers of the dead children were found to have extremely high blood lead concentrations, in many cases above 1000 \u03bcg/L (in children, a concentration above 100 \u03bcg/L may impair neurological development, and 700 \u03bcg/L is considered to require immediate action). \n\nFollowing a formal request from Senegal, WHO has deployed an international team consisting of a clinical toxicologist, an environmental health specialist and analytical chemist. This team has conducted clinical examinations and further environmental investigations in NGagne Diaw. Clinical examinations have confirmed continuing high blood lead concentrations in the original group studied, as well as in a randomly-selected group of adults and children who were not involved in lead recycling. Many children are showing evidence of neurological damage. Environmental investigations have found very high concentrations of lead both outside and inside peoples' homes. These have been mapped to an area inhabited by approximately 950 people, who are continuously exposed through ingestion and inhalation of lead-contaminated dust. \n\nWHO has advised the Senegalese authorities about the need for urgent action to terminate exposure of the affected population to lead, and to provide chelation and other therapy to children with high blood lead concentrations. Chelation therapy in children who continue to be exposed to lead is ineffective and may exacerbate toxicity. Plans are in hand to hospitalize the worst-affected cases, but they will then need to be able to return to a lead-free environment. WHO has provided chelating agents, and the clinical toxicologist has started training local medical staff. Further systematic investigation of the population of NGagne Diaw is needed, as well as the administration of appropriate treatment. Thorough decontamination of the affected area of NGagne Diaw, including the insides of homes, is a high priority. \n\nTo deal effectively with this environmental and public health emergency the Senegalese authorities will require urgent technical and financial assistance from the international community. WHO is briefing its UN and other partners about the situation in order to facilitate the provision of the necessary resources. \nFor more information\n\n\nSenegal: Outbreak of lead intoxication in Thiaroye sur Mer  20 June 2008Environmental Health Emergencies website",

        "Description of the Situation": "18 June 2008 -\nNorthern Nigeria is currently affected by a new outbreak of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1), which has begun to spread internationally. In 2008, a nine-fold increase in new cases caused by this serotype has been reported compared with the same period in 2007. This outbreak in northern Nigeria has the potential to cause major international outbreaks, as occurred in 2003-2006. This year, Nigeria accounts for 86% of WPV1 cases in the world. \n\nThis new outbreak in Nigeria has occurred because upwards of 20% of children remain unimmunized in key high-risk areas for polio in the north of the country. From 2003 to 2006, an outbreak in northern Nigeria led to national and international spread of the disease, eventually re-infecting 20 previously polio-free countries, causing outbreaks in places as far away as Indonesia and Yemen, and resulting in 1,475 cases in these 20 countries. \n\nNew WPV1 genetically linked to viruses from northern Nigeria has now been confirmed in Benin (one case, onset 17 April 2008) and the western part of Niger (1 case, in Tillaberry province, close to the borders with Burkina Faso and Mali; onset 11 April 2008). It is from these areas that WPV1 originating from Nigeria spread across west, central and the Horn of Africa in 2003-2004, re-infecting \u2013 among others \u2013 C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea and Togo. In addition to international spread of WPV1 from northern Nigeria, wild poliovirus type 3 (WPV3) originating from northern Nigeria has been reported from Chad (onset of most recent case 13 April 2008).\n\nThe risk of renewed international spread of polio from Nigeria is increasing due to the intensity of the outbreak in northern Nigeria, the upcoming rainy season which is associated with increased transmission of poliovirus, and the anticipated large-scale population movements for the Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia) in the second half of 2008. Saudi Arabia has been notified of the increased risk of polio infection to Hajj pilgrims. \n\nNigeria has planned two large-scale rounds of emergency polio immunization in the northern states in July and August 2008. Large-scale emergency polio immunization campaigns were conducted on 13-16 June in high-risk and border areas of Benin, Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger, followed by additional campaigns in July. Disease surveillance is being heightened in 'at-risk' countries, including in those re-infected in 2003-2006. \nFor more information\n\n\nGlobal Polio Eradication Initiative",

Rio de Janeiro, where DEN-3 has been the predominant circulating serotype for the past 5 years since the major DEN-3 epidemic in 2002, is now experiencing the renewed circulation of DEN-2. This has led to an increase in severe dengue cases in children and about 50% of the deaths, so far, have been children of 0-13 years of age.\n\nThe Ministry of Health (MoH) is working closely with the Rio de Janeiro branch of the Centro de Informa\u00e7\u00f5es Estrat\u00e9gicas em Vigil\u00e2ncia em Sa\u00fade (CIEVS) to implement the required control measures and identify priority areas for intervention.

        "Description of the Situation": "Epidemiological situation: low levels of meningitis activity so far in 2008\n\n22 February 2008\n\nThe WHO Multi-Disease Surveillance Centre in Ouagadougou (MDSC - Burkina Faso) is monitoring the meningitis situation in the African meningitis belt throughout the epidemic season and in particular, in 13 countries under enhanced seasonal surveillance: Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mali, Niger, Nigeria and Togo. Preliminary reports from these countries are of a total of 2,312 cases (324 deaths) occurring between 1 January and 10 February 2008. These figures are 29% lower than those reported in the same 6 week period in 2007 (3,274 cases, 413 deaths) indicating lower levels of meningitis activity so far in 2008.\n\nAmong countries reporting cases to the MDSC, Burkina Faso, the Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of the Congo have been reporting outbreaks since the beginning of the season. Other countries reporting meningitis activity without reaching the epidemic threshold at district level include Benin, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mali, Niger, Nigeria and Togo. Cameroon and Chad have not reported any cases.\n\nBurkina Faso is the most affected country with a total of 1,422 cases, including 204 deaths (case fatality ratio- 14.3%) reported from 1 January to 10 February. These cases represent more than 61% of all cases reported to MDSC in 2008 (against 64% for the same period in 2007)\n\nNeisseria meningitidis A (Nm A) was identified as the causative agent in Mangodara and Sapouy districts. Vaccination was carried out in these districts as well as in Gaoua, targeting the 2 to 29-year-old population. A cross border assessment is being carried out on the situation in Ivory Coast in the area neighbouring Mangodara district. Although the epidemiological trend in Burkina Faso is similar to the one observed last year, the first 6 weeks of 2007 saw more cases reported in total as well as more districts reaching the epidemic threshold (8 as against 2 in 2008).\n\nThe Ministry of Health in the Central African Republic is launching reactive mass vaccination campaigns in some of the communes that have reached the epidemic threshold in the Northern prefecture of Nana-Gribizi. A total of 45 cases, including 5 deaths (CFR 11.1%) had been reported by the end of week 6 and Nm A has been identified as the responsible pathogen. International partners including WHO and the International Coordination Group (ICG) are providing support for the vaccination campaigns.\n\nIn the Democratic Republic of the Congo1 a situation assessment is being carried out in Aru district that neighbours Arua district in Uganda) where 167 cases, including 17 deaths (CFR 10.2%) were reported during the period from 1 January to 10 February 2008. The most affected areas include Laybo, Ariwara and Aungba health zones. The Aru district also experienced an outbreak in early 2007. \nSituation in other countries of the meningitis belt\n\nIn Southern Sudan a situation assessment is being carried out in areas where suspected cases were reported including in Awerial, Bor, Jur River and Torit Counties.\n\nUganda experienced an outbreak in Arua district West Nile region, with a total of 380 cases, including 17 deaths (CFR 4.5%) reported from 13 December 2007 to 28 January 2008. A sharp decline in the weekly case count was observed following a mass vaccination campaign that was implemented in week 04.\n\nNo suspected cases have been reported from other countries within the meningitis belt, namely Eritrea, Guinea, the Gambia, Kenya, Mauritania and Senegal.\nVaccine availability through the ICG\n\nSo far in 2008, the ICG has provided 40,000 vaccine doses, injection material and safety disposal boxes for vaccination campaigns in the Central African Republic.\n\nThe current ICG stockpile, available of outbreak response in this meningitis season stands at 7 million doses of bivalent polysaccharide A/C vaccine and 3.3 million doses of trivalent polysaccharide vaccine A/C/W135.\n\nFor more information on submitting requests for vaccines through the ICG and regional meningitis surveillance see links below.\n\n\nInternational Coordinating Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision for Epidemic Meningitis Control \n\n\nEpidemiological information\n\n\n\n\n1Thresholds are not applicable to this country on the border with the meningitis belt",

The last person to be infected by the virus was discharged on 8th January 2008. This is more than double the maximum incubation period (42 days) for Ebola.\n\nA national task force coordinated the response to this outbreak, comprising MoH, WHO and other international partners in the field, including experts from M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF - Suisse), African Field Epidemiology Network (AFENET), International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, UNICEF and WFP. International technical and operational coordination was supported through the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), and networks of regional experts and technical institutions..\n\nThe Ugandan Government, WHO and other partners, established an active surveillance system for the detection of cases and follow up of their contacts. Mobile district teams were sent to the field to investigate rumours, obtain clinical specimens for laboratory tests, hospitalize patients and monitor their contacts. Mobile teams, including trained Red Cross volunteers, followed up a cumulative total of 804 contacts on a daily basis. Isolation wards were established at hospitals in Kikyo and Bundibugyo, and training was provided for health care workers and auxiliary staff in appropriate triage and infection control measures. A cumulative total of 75 patients were treated in both isolation facilities.\n\nLaboratory experts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, USA, provided support to the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) in diagnosis and analysis of samples. Specimens from suspected cases were collected and referred for laboratory confirmation to a joint CDC and UVRI team in Entebbe, Uganda.\n\nLaboratory analysis undertaken at CDC has confirmed that the virus associated with the outbreak is different from the 3 African Ebola species (namely Za\u00efre, Sudan and Ivory Coast species) and should be considered as a new species of Ebola virus.\n\nThe Ministry of Health and IFRC conducted intensive social mobilization activities, including the use of radio broadcasts and mobile film vans to reach at-risk communities. Fact sheets, brochures and posters were also distributed.",

Another cluster with 4 clinically compatible cases occurred in the urban area of San Lorenzo municipality, 20 km from Asuncion. Final confirmation of these 4 cases is pending.\n\nThe Ministry of Health has strengthened public health containment measures in the affected areas. Integrated control measures involving mass vaccination for people living in, or travelling to, the affected area; vector control; and heightened surveillance are underway to prevent serious public health consequences given the current low level of immunization among the people living in the affected area.\n\nA PAHO team of experts including an epidemiologist, clinician/virologist, risk communicator, immunization advisers and emergency management experts was deployed to Paraguay on 15 February. A laboratory scientist from IEC Instituto Evandro Chagas (Brazil) will join the national public health laboratory shortly.\n\nYellow fever vaccines shortage has been addressed by mobilizing vaccines available in countries of the region. In addition, the MoH has requested 2 million doses of vaccine from the WHO ICG (International Coordinating Group on Vaccine Provision).\nFor more information\n\n\nEmerging and Reemerging Infectious Diseases UpdatesPan American Health Organization, Regional Office for the Americas of the World Health Organization",

Twenty one confirmed cases had never been vaccinated for yellow fever and the other 2 were last vaccinated over 20 years ago.\n\nThis outbreak of yellow fever follows an epizootic outbreak in monkeys that started in April 2007 and has since spread to 80 municipalities. An increase in the number of epizootic events was observed between December 2007 and January 2008, reaching more than 23 new municipalities in that period.\n\nBrazil has suspended exports of yellow fever vaccine from Bio-Manguinhos, one of three WHO pre-qualified manufacturers of yellow fever vaccine, based in Brazil, in order to meet the needs of the country to respond to this outbreak.\n\nOn 18 January, the Brazilian Ministry of Health submitted a request to borrow an additional 4 million doses of vaccine from the global emergency stockpile managed by the International Coordinating Group on Vaccine Provision for Yellow Fever Control (YF-ICG), in order to complete the required levels of yellow fever vaccines stocks held nationally to enable an emergency vaccination campaign.\n\nThe campaign which targets approx 7 million people, in the most affected states will be carried out in early February. Due to the coordinated efforts between the ICG and United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) Supply Division, the 4 millions doses arrived in Brazil in early February.\n\nThe yellow fever emergency stockpile is financed by the GAVI Alliance and managed by the YF-ICG.
